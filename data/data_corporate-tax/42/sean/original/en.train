From Fox News:\n\nDrivers across town are brazenly tossing aside street-blocking barriers set up as part of Mayor Bill de Blasio's plan to provide outdoor recreation space amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFrustrated New Yorkers told The Post they've had to take enforcement of the street closures into their own hands as motorists flaunt the program — and that it has even sparked tug-of-wars between neighbors.\n\nWithin the first week it was clear that some neighbors did not like the impediment of the open street barrier, so they would just take it down, Noel Hidalgo, of Greenpoint, said of the traffic clot on Berry Street between North 12th Street and Broadway.\n\nIt's been a war of attrition, to the point that yesterday the remaining twigs of one wooden blue barrier were pulverized by a driver.\n\nLaunched in mid-May, de Blasio's Open Streets initiative has so far restricted motorists from about 67 miles of Big Apple roads, with the aim to close off 100 miles so residents can get fresh air while still social distancing.\n\nWhile the open streets are in effect between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., motorists making deliveries or dropping people off are still allowed to drive through slowly, and utility, emergency and city service vehicles are OK, too.\n\nBut despite the ban on unnecessary traffic, some drivers have been taking back the supposedly pedestrian-only plazas, and moving the wooden blue and metal NYPD blockades so they can get through, residents in multiple locations told The Post.
Democratic challenger for Governor of New York Cynthia Nixon dodged questions surrounding her massive tax scheme Thursday; claiming the state's high taxes actually makes the region more business friendly.\n\nNixon was speaking with MSNBC when she was asked if New York's wealthy residents and their businesses would leave should she implement her millionaire's tax.\n\nIf you were successful in imposing a millionaire's tax or corporate tax, what makes you think those companies and those wealthy people would stay in New York? asked MSNBC's Rick Tyler.\n\nI think that wealthy individuals have the liberty of choosing where they want to live. If high taxes were a thing that would make wealthy people move, we wouldn't have so many wealthy people in New York, said Nixon.\n\nIf we want to create jobs for New Yorkers, investing in infrastructure is the most effective way to do it, and it's a way to prepare our state for the future and make it more business friendly, she concluded.
Democrats, along with their partners in the media, have decided to criminalize a phrase that millions of people say every day. The cornerstone of the Democrats', and the media's plan to impeach President Trump depends on their ability to sell another lie to the American people.\n\nIn Gregg's new book, Witch Hunt: The Story of the Greatest Mass Delusion in American Political History, he shows that Democrats and the media set a new standard for bloviating, simply making things up, and manufacturing all manner of falsehoods.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe phrase, If true… followed by the inevitable, …it's impeachable, became the common mantra of both the media and Democrats. They did this to keep the Russia hoax story alive, hoping it would lead to impeachment. With those hopes and dreams crashing and burning with the Mueller report and Mueller's testimony, they are now hoping the American people will support the impeachment of their President based on their interpretation of the tone of the phrase do me a favor.\n\nIn order to support impeachment, they have projected their negative feelings towards the President onto this phrase, and have determined that when he told the Ukrainian president to do me a favor, he said it in the tone of a poorly scripted Robert De Niro character.\n\nIf they had done any research into the President, and his unique idiolect, they would realize that this is one of his go-to phrases. Along with I know the best people, big league, believe me, and Fake News the President has said do me a favor well over 100 times.\n\nA simple search through some of his events shows that he said the phrase at least 123 times in speeches and press conferences from the time he announced his presidential run until mid-July of 2019.\n\nJune 18, 2015, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski Interview Donald Trump\n\nI said, would you do me a favor?

4:00 PM ET – Austan Goolsbee, is an economist who is currently a Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. Goolsbee formerly served as the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and was a member of the cabinet of President Barack Obama. Goolsbee had this to say about Sanders and Bloomberg in the debates:\n\nI thought it was a little unfair. Bernie Sanders doesn't advocate communism, said Goolsbee, who said that the former mayor was clearly talking about Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who together represent the more progressive wing of the Democratic field. It was a funny line that Mayor Bloomberg had there, but I thought overall that his performance left a lot to be desired.\n\nThe former Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers said that Sanders speaks to a desire to reject the Trumpism, corporate power, and $2 trillion of tax cuts. Goolsbee says he supports Pete Buttigieg, the moderate 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana because he has the most sensible plan.\n\nStill, the former economic adviser for Obama said that Sanders was especially strong when he evoked government support from the other side — the wealthy side.\n\nI thought Bernie Sanders was pretty effective when he said: 'You say you don't like socialism, but how is giving $2 trillion to corporations, not socialism, just upside down socialism?' Goolsbee said, referring to tax cuts under the Trump administration.\n\n5:00 PM ET – Leslie Marshall, Fox News Contributor and Host of the Leslie Marshall Show and Eddie Scarry, Columnist for the Washington Examiner and author of Privileged Victims, debate the race-baiting and phony handouts from the democrats running to be the party's candidate. With the politicization of the Coronavirus there seems to be no end to the new lows that the liberals and democrat party will stoop to:\n\nFor the second evening in a row on Thursday, ABC's World News Tonight (and this time NBC Nightly News) seemed intent on whipping the public into a state of fear with suggestions the Trump administration wasn't adequately responding to the coronavirus (COVID-19) threat. NBC News even tried to shake public coincidence in Vice President Mike Pence's leadership of the COVID-19 task force assigned to deal with the threat.\n\nABC special correspondent Kyra Phillips began her report by scoffing at the idea that President Trump had anything to tout when it came to how his administration was handling things. As stocks swan-dive and coronavirus fears grow, President Trump today praising his administration's response, now being led by Vice President Mike Pence, she said.\n\n5:30 PM ET – Sean's exclusive interview with VP Mike Pence
Official 'Squad' Member Rashida Tlaib sounded the alarm on President Trump's tax cuts Monday; pledging to repeal the legislation and give the money back to the people that earned it.\n\nRecently, I introduced the Boost Act.

We're going to go ahead and put it in the pockets of every day Americans… We give it back to the people that earned it, said Tlaib.\n\n.@RashidaTlaib at the #NAACPConvention on her Boost Act: I'm going to take money from the rich and give it back to the people, those who earned it. pic.twitter.com/P0e94sTu0O — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) July 22, 2019\n\nStunning footage emerged on social media over the weekend showing now-Representative Rashida Tlaib being forcibly removed from a Donald Trump event in Michigan back in August 2016.\n\nYears before Rep. Rashida Tlaib was speaking out against President Trump in Congress, she was shouting at him as Secret Service members dragged her out of a meeting at the Detroit Economic Club, reports Fox News.\n\nVideo of the August 2016 incident, which has gone viral since resurfacing over the weekend, shows the current congresswoman shouting as then-candidate Trump delivered a speech before business leaders. While being escorted out of the room, she continued to jump and yell at those in attendance, adds Fox.\n\nMy god!

A new study released by a bipartisan think-tank threw more cold water on Sen. Elizabeth Warren's 'Medicare for All' proposal this week; saying it would be impossible to fund the plan by simply raising taxes on the wealthy.\n\nThe report, published by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, examines a variety of potential ways to raise the estimated $30 trillion over 10 years necessary to fund 'Medicare-for-all,' including a 32 percent payroll tax, a 25 percent income surtax and a 42 percent value-added tax. These methods could all raise $30 trillion, the report says, but there is no way for the federal government to bring in that much money simply by taxing rich people, reports Fox News.\n\nThere is not enough annual income available among higher earners to finance the full cost of 'Medicare-for-All,' it says. On a static basis, even increasing the top two income tax rates (applying to individuals making over $204,000 per year and couples making over $408,000 per year) to 100 percent would not raise $30 trillion over a decade.\n\nHow you finance #MedicareForAll matters A LOT. For example, many option could lift marginal rates to or above revenue-maximizing levels, leaving little tax capacity to fund much of anything else. https://t.co/eIP40nc1N8 cc/ @BudgetHawks pic.twitter.com/dkPJxZqIUO — Marc Goldwein (@MarcGoldwein) October 28, 2019\n\nWarren has refused to comment on whether her massive healthcare proposal would ultimately raise taxes on all Americans -including the middle class.\n\nSen.

Democratic presidential hopeful Andrew Yang proposed a new tax to alter Americans' eating habits this week; saying the government should include the cost of cow emissions in beef products sold across the USA.\n\nCattle is very energy expensive. If you project forward, what we need to do to reduce emissions, we would want to modify America's diets over time. What you'd want to do, is have those cattle producers to internalize the cost of emissions, said Yang.\n\nWhat that would naturally do, and some people will hate this, is make these products more expensive. And that would be appropriate, he added.\n\n.@AndrewYang says beef should include the cost of cows' emissions so that it becomes so expensive people stop eating it. pic.twitter.com/ZoDtCp0fT5 — Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) September 19, 2019\n\nOriginal Story: September 9, 2019\n\nA European scientist speaking at a summit in Sweden last week suggested a controversial new trend to combat climate change: consuming human flesh as an alternative to animal products.\n\nStockholm School of Economics professor and researcher Magnus Soderlund reportedly said he believes eating human meat, derived from dead bodies, might be able to help save the human race if only a world society were to 'awaken the idea,' reports the New York Post.\n\nAt a summit for food of the future (the climate-ravaged future) called Gastro Summit, in Stockholm on Sept. 3 to 4, a professor held a PowerPoint presentation asserting that we must 'awaken the idea' of eating human flesh in the future, as a way of combating the effects of climate change, adds the Epoch Times.\n\nScientist suggests eating human flesh to fight climate change https://t.co/LjPDblTNxJ pic.twitter.com/TNoCbVbJaL — New York Post (@nypost) September 9, 2019\n\nThe scientist's unusual dietary suggestion comes days after presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg likened humanity's fight against climate change to the Second World War.\n\nMayor Pete was speaking during CNN's televised town hall event when he called the fight against global warming the hardest thing that we will have done in my lifetime.\n\nWe have to unify the country around this project… This is the hardest thing that we will have done in my lifetime, on par with winning World War 2, perhaps even more challenging than that, said the Democrat.\n\nThis is the most offensive thing said at the CNN Climate town hall:\n\nButtigieg says fighting climate change is more challenging than winning World War II.\n\nBullshit.\n\n85 million people died in WWII.\n\n500,000 Americans.\n\nHe owes every American who lost loved ones in WWII an apology. pic.twitter.com/FfSK3PzM9s — Benny (@bennyjohnson) September 5, 2019\n\nFailing candidate Beto O'Rourke made similar statements during the event, saying West Texas will become uninhabitable for human beings in the near future.\n\nMy son Henry, who's 8-years-old, he asked me, 'Dad, if you win and you become President, we get to live in El Paso, right?'

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called for a nationwide robot tax this week; saying the measure would penalize large corporations that automate production and eliminate American jobs.\n\nThe scale of automation in our economy is increasing far faster than most people realize, and its impact on working people in America and across the world, unless corralled, will be devastating, writes De Blasio.\n\nBut automation and human employment should not be viewed as mutually exclusive. America has welcomed technological advancement throughout our history, and we still should, as long as the benefits of these advancements are shared evenly instead of solely going to big corporations, adds the mayor. As mayor of New York, and as a candidate for President focused on the needs of working people, I've seen at home and across the country that workers can benefit from these technological changes, but we can't let American jobs be replaced by them. That's why I'm proposing a new plan today to protect American workers and ensure that we all share in the gains from technological advancement.\n\nIt's official. The Democrats want to tax everything, said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform. De Blasio had to find a way to stand out after the rest of the Democrat field had already laid claim to raising taxes on income, payroll, carbon dioxide, capital gains, small businesses, corporations, your 401k, lifetime savings, and death.\n\nDe Blasio's plan calls for the creation of the Federal Automation and Worker Protection Agency (FAWPA) to oversee production.\n\nRead De Blasio's full plan here.
President Trump slammed the New York Times Wednesday morning after the national newspaper released ten years of his business tax returns; calling the move an inaccurate Fake News hit job.\n\nReal estate developers in the 1980's & 1990's, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would, if one was actively building, show losses and tax losses in almost all cases. Much was non monetary. Sometimes considered 'tax shelter,' …You would get it by building, or even buying. You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes….almost all real estate developers did – and often re-negotiate with banks, it was sport.

Washington became the latest west coast state to declare itself a 'Sanctuary' for all illegal immigrants this week; joining California and Oregon that have implemented similar laws in recent years.\n\nGov. Jay Inslee signed the measure Tuesday implementing the new rules, which rank among the strongest statewide mandates in the nation. California and Oregon have similar laws, reports the Associated Press.\n\nThe move comes as President Donald Trump's administration has cracked down on immigration by increasing migrant detentions and attempting to cancel the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, adds the article.\n\nThe new law, local police departments and sheriffs are largely banned from asking detained individuals about their legal status in the United States. The legislation also bars prisons and other agencies from complying with federal guidelines proposed by ICE and US Border Patrol.\n\nOur state agencies are not immigration enforcement agencies, said the Governor. We will not be complicit in the Trump administration's depraved efforts to break up hard-working immigrant and refugee families.\n\nWashington's decision comes just days after the 'Sanctuary City' of Oakland, California declared itself largely broke.\n\nThe Sanctuary City of Oakland, California is now facing a massive $25 million financial gap in its operating budget for 2019; diverting emergency funds to keep the street lights on as resources run dry.\n\nAt a time when Oakland is trying to cure its pothole epidemic, the city is planning to use $2.9 million in state gas tax money to keep its streetlights on, then use what it saves of its own money to stave off cuts in parks and recreation, reports the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nThough cranes are rising across the skyline and Oakland's revenues are growing at a steady rate due to the strong real estate market, the city's expenses continue to rise faster than revenues, said Mayor Libby Schaaf.\n\nSchaaf made national headlines last year when she tipped-off illegal immigrants of impending ICE raids; violating federal law and prompting a fierce backlash from the Trump administration.\n\nRead the full report at the Associated Press.

During the final days of the 2020 general election, Joe Biden routinely pledges to expand his predecessor's disastrous healthcare reform law; this time calling it 'Bidencare.'\n\nThe former Vice President fails to discuss the millions of Americans who found themselves without insurance or battling a growing bureaucracy that didn't exist just months before the bill.\n\nHere's one family's story…\n\nJoe Biden has been running an ad in which he says he can't imagine what it would be like to have a child with cancer and no health coverage. I don't have to imagine. Under the health 'reform' championed by Biden when he served as President Barack Obama's vice president, I live that reality every day, writes Christopher Briggs.\n\nTwice over the past three years, ObamaCare has had no plans to sell us that covers little girls ravaged by cancer or recovering from that ordeal — and it might leave us floundering again, adds the father.\n\nThanks to ObamaCare, we were already in financial straits. In 2014, the law had eliminated a great plan we had had for years. Before ObamaCare went into effect, the private marketplace offered us a wide menu of relatively inexpensive plans that covered specialist care, even out of state, concludes Briggs. Turns out there is a nightmare worse than one's watching cancer brutalize one's little girl. It's having Obama's law — which his vice president rightly claims as his own — collude with the disease against her.\n\nRead the full story at the New York Post.
VIDEO: Oregon Woman Holds Suspected Wildfire Arsonist At Gunpoint Until Cops Arrive\n\nposted by Hannity Staff - 9.20.20\n\nOne Oregon woman showed incredible bravery we wished we saw more of during these tumultuous times. The unbelievable ordeal was caught on video. So unbelievable in fact, that critics believe the whole thing was staged or faked. The woman in the video, however, Kat Cast, defended herself on Facebook saying the incident truly did happen and there is nothing fake about it.\n\nThe video begins from inside a car pulling over and a woman, Cast, gets out with a gun while yelling get on the floor. Get on the floor right now. Face down to a young man who was on her property. He complies as she approaches him holding her gun, mostly behind her back and not pointed directly at him. What are you doing on my property? she asked. Just passing through he says, and she continues to question him.\n\nDid you light anything on fire? she proceeded. No Ma'am he answered. What are you doing with those matches? he responded that he smokes. Where are your F***ing cigarettes she asked, after which he admitted he didn't have any. Cast held him at gunpoint until police arrived. Unlike Cast, many property owners have been unable to protect their lifelong investments and livelihood. In many large Democratic cities, the criminals are better protected than the citizens and business owners.\n\nThus far Cast has declined to speak further publicly about the incident except for her Facebook statement. I will tell you something though if I need to do this again to protect my family and my neighbors, I will in a heartbeat do it again, except this time I will not be as nice as I was.\n\nCast's anger, concern and emotion is no surprise. Violence, crime, looting, executions of police officers are plaguing the nation, as well as wildfires spreading across the northwest. The video came after weeks of devastating wildfires have raged up and down the West Coast. In Oregon, looters and thieves have compounded the tragedy as residents try to evacuate from active fire fronts and law enforcement staffing is already on short supply reports Fox News.\n\nA simple PSA to anti-law enforcement citizens in favor of defunding the police: who exactly would you call to defend your property in a similar situation?

Andrew Cuomo signed a bill Monday that could allow lawmakers on Capitol Hill to obtain President Trump's state tax returns, in what has been described as a 'workaround' after failed efforts by House Democrats to get the president's federal returns, reports Fox News.\n\nPreviously, state tax returns had to remain private with an exception for law enforcement. The new bill — which could face a legal challenge in the future — adds an exception that says the state's Commissioner of the Department of Taxation and Finance has to turn over information requested by the head of the House Ways and Means Committee, Senate Finance Committee, or Joint Committee on Taxation, adds Fox.\n\nTax secrecy is paramount — the exception being for bonafide investigative and law enforcement purposes, Cuomo said in a statement. By amending the law enforcement exception in New York State tax code to include Congressional tax-related committees, this bill gives Congress the ability to fulfill its Constitutional responsibilities, strengthen our democratic system and ensure that no one is above the law.

Ronald Reagan, in his 1964 speech A Time for Choosing, said You and I are told increasingly that we have to choose between a left or right, but I would like to suggest that there is no such thing as a left or right. There is only an up or down — up to a man's age-old dream, the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order — or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism, and regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward course. This description of the political divide was entirely correct. The leading Democratic candidates are a reflection of this gravitational-like pull, both constant and exponential, towards totalitarianism. They call this fall towards totalitarianism being progressive, the issue is where they are progressing towards. Each Democratic candidate has fought to be the most progressive candidate. For example, recently Joe Biden claimed he had the most progressive record out of all the candidates running, Bernie Sanders responded: I think if you look at Joe's record and you look at my record, I don't think there's much question about who's more progressive. According to the Los Angeles Times, Elizabeth Warren, who has also been labeled the most progressive candidate, has overtaken Bernie Sanders in polling, with Joe Biden still in the lead. The role of government at its highest and most optimal level is to protect each individual's life, liberty, and property. Despite this, these Democratic candidates want to extend the role of government to usurp each individual's life, liberty, and property\n\nThroughout the 20th century, multiple totalitarian regimes embraced eugenics, which is the evil belief that some populations are genetically inferior or superior, and this resulted in the loss of millions of innocent human lives. For example, during the 1930s and 1940s eugenics was used as a basis for the and the Ukrainian Genocide. During this time, eugenic principles spread to many countries and disgusting policies were created, such as forced sterilization and marriage prohibition. Eugenic principles are even seen today; in a New York Times interview with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, she claimed the reason for federally permitted abortion was to limit growth in populations that we don't want to many of. Cases like the legality of abortion illustrate the disregard for human life that is an inherent characteristic of a totalitarian regime. Life begins at conception, according to Princeton University, this is when a new human organism is created. This means that, by definition, abortion is ending the life of another individual. Ignoring this fact, every single Democratic candidate supports abortion, most support late-term abortion, and no Democratic candidate is against late-term abortion. A large part of their argument is that the government may not infringe on a woman's right to choose, leaning on the idea that the government must protect their own liberty. This not only clashes with the government's duty of protecting the life of the baby, but it also relies on the government allowing one individual to infringe on the liberty of another. An individual's freedom cannot override another individual's; there is no Venn diagram of liberty.\n\nThe boundaries of freedom end where another's freedom begins. The fine line that defines the limits of liberty can be summed up in the expression the right to swing my fist ends where your nose begins. The issue of defining liberty and rights often is the core of many political issues because people often do not understand that rights and liberty are effectively synonymous. For example, the left commonly argues that universal healthcare is a right, but this argument completely forgets what rights are. The Bill of Rights were not rights granted from the government, they were boundaries set to fully restrict the power of government from certain areas. This is why terms like Congress shall make no law are used so often. In the healthcare scenario, the right to healthcare would require the government to provide this right, but the job of government would be to not stop an individual in getting healthcare, not provide it. Further, for the government to provide healthcare they would have to be providing the service of one individual, the doctor, as a right to another individual. The government cannot provide an individual's service without effectively owning that individual's labor, enslaving that individual through the involuntary enforcement of their provision of labor. The free market is built to be voluntary transactions between two parties, government intervention blocks voluntary transactions. A $15 an hour minimum wage, for example, blocks an employee from working for $14 an hour even if the employer cannot afford the $15 an hour. The result here is that the employee loses their job, the employer loses his ability to hire enough employees, the business fails, everybody loses. While there may be some people who benefit from the $15 an hour minimum wage, such as large companies like Amazon, who supports this legislation, it is at the expense of those who cannot afford it, like small business owners. There are two sides to every coin and policies like universal healthcare highlight one side and neglect the other.\n\nIf we own our labor then, by extension, we own the product of our labor. As Abraham Lincoln explains, property is the fruit of labor, and the government should be protecting property, not controlling it. The Democratic candidates believe they not only own an individual's labor but that they believe they own what an individual earns from their labor. Many policies that these candidates push rely on the tyranny of the majority. They push unrealistic policies that would\n\nbenefit the majority by dehumanizing the minority, stripping away their intrinsic human rights. For example, welfare programs are the forced confiscation of an individual's property to be given to someone else. Socialist programs like these are the foundation of totalitarianism; they are seen in practically every authoritarian government. In order for social programs like this to work, there must be the presumption that the government owns the property of the individual. If the government can control an individual's wealth, or property, to any degree, the government owns the wealth. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, for example, pushes a 90% tax on the upper class in order to distribute more wealth to the poor. If a 90% tax is allowed then there is no reason a 100% tax should not be allowed. The income tax, in general, requires the acceptance that the government can increase or decrease the amount of wealth it decides to take from the people. A 1% income tax requires the same argument as a 100% income tax, both are infringements on human rights. It does not matter that the politicians in government are elected; any government for a free people should not be able to confiscate the property of its citizens.\n\nThese Democratic candidates seek to exponentially centralize and strengthen the government. They show no regard for natural human rights or the boundaries of government. They preach that as our society evolves the Constitution needs to be reinterpreted as it changes with our society; this is a façade. These bureaucrats who operate on the idea of a living and breathing Constitution are just attempting to devalue the Constitution, so they can gain power. A Constitution that is not accepted as fixed and immutable is meaningless. The Constitution is a set of rules to bind the government within a sphere of power if the government gets to interpret those rules as loosely as it pleases then the rules are nothing more than a speed bump on the road to totalitarianism. Any Constitutionally questionable laws are cracks in the dam of the Constitution; each crack weakens it more and more until our freedoms are flooded by the tyranny of government. The Democratic candidates are trying to pull our country further down towards totalitarianism; no matter which of these candidates wins the primary, a vote for any of them is a vote for oppression and authoritarianism.
AXELROD ON BIDEN: 'He Either Can Cut It, Or He Can't'\n\nposted by Hannity Staff - 8.15.19\n\nDemocratic strategist David Axelrod weighed-in Thursday on Joe Biden's potentially reduced campaign schedule; saying this is bad advice and claiming the former Vice President can either cut it or he can't.\n\nThis is bad advice.

The allies, growing increasingly nervous about Biden's verbal flubs, have said it's an approach that's been suggested to campaign officials on the heels of the former vice president's stumbles.\n\nHe needs to be a strong force on the campaign trail, but he also has to pace himself, said one insider.\n\nI think you'll see the same schedule and maybe even more Joe Biden, one ally said. Everyone wants to see Joe Biden be Joe Biden. If he's held back in any way, that's almost the antithesis of who he is.\n\nI think it's the wrong approach, they added.\n\nJoe Biden has spoken his mind his entire life, which voters know and love about him, said Biden's deputy campaign manager. He's a real person, he's authentic, and that will never change. He's going to keep taking on Trump and making the case to voters about the stakes we face in this election, regardless of how the press chooses to cover him.\n\nPresident Trump routinely refers to Biden as sleepy Joe.
A new report from Americans for Tax Reform released this week shows Speaker Nancy Pelosi is planning a potential 33% corporate tax hike for her 2020 budget; raising the current rate from 21% to 28%.\n\nHouse Budget Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) has announced that the forthcoming budget blueprint will call for a 33 percent corporate income tax rate increase by hiking the rate from 21 percent to 28 percent. This would make the U.S. a less competitive place to do business and make the U.S. statutory rate higher than many developed competitors, writes the ATR.\n\nIf passed, the revised rate would top other developed countries such as the UK at 19%, China at 25% and Canada at 26.8%.\n\nHiking the tax rate on American businesses will kill jobs, lower wages, and reduce new investment in America, said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform. Why do the Democrats want to damage American competitiveness and job creation?\n\nRead the full report here.
A handful of Wall Street insiders and leading economists are revising their GDP predictions upwards for spring 2019; saying the US economy may grow by an astounding 5% in the coming months.\n\nAccording to Market Watch, forecasts for next year are being revised after a string of healthy tax returns, repatriated currency, and record low unemployment in the second quarter of 2018; possibly reaching a 15 year high this spring.\n\nMost notably, Macroeconomic Advisers raised its forecast to 5.3% from 4.5% for gross domestic product, the official scorecard for the U.S. economy. The firm's forecast is one of the most detailed on Wall Street, writes Market Watch.\n\nThe last time the Gross Domestic Product smashed the 5% mark was in 2003.\n\nRead the full report here.
From predominantly black neighborhoods in Detroit to Navajo communities in the southwest to Louisiana's Cancer Alley , industrial pollution has been concentrated in low-income communities for decades, she adds . The Green New Deal will involve deploying trillions of dollars to transform the way we source and use energy. In doing so, the government must prioritize resources to support vulnerable communities and remediate historic injustices.\n\nJustice for communities on the front lines of the climate crisis must be at the core of our response to climate change. Here's my plan for how I'll center environmental justice in the fight to end the climate crisis. https://t.co/agB4llfPRg\n\nIn 1987, the United Church of Christ's Commission on Racial Justice commissioned one of the first studies on hazardous waste in communities of color. A few years later – 28 years ago this month – delegates to the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit adopted 17 principles of environmental justice. But in the years since, the federal government has largely failed to live up to the vision these trailblazing leaders outlined, and to its responsibilities to the communities they represent, writes Warren.\n\nDemocratic frontrunner Elizabeth Warren unveiled her latest policy proposal regarding climate change this week; calling for $1.5 trillion in new spending to combat environmental racism.\n\nANOTHER NEW DEAL? Warren Proposes Using US MILITARY to Combat Climate Change\n\nposted by Hannity Staff - 5.20.19\n\nFirebrand Senator and potential 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren unveiled her latest proposal to combat climate change Monday; suggesting the use of the US military to confront global warming.\n\nIn short, climate change is real, it is worsening by the day, and it is undermining our military readiness. And instead of meeting this threat head-on, Washington is ignoring it — and making it worse, writes Warren in an op-ed published by Medium.\n\nWe have the most capable military in the world. It's also the single largest government consumer of energy, and it's dependent on fossil fuels. The Pentagon spends about $4 billion a year to power its bases at fixed locations and consumes tens of billions of barrels of fuel per year, she adds.\n\nNibbling around the edges of the problem is no longer enough — the urgency of the moment demands more. That's why today I am introducing my Defense Climate Resiliency and Readiness Act to harden the U.S. military against the threat posed by climate change, and to leverage its huge energy footprint as part of our climate solution, concludes Warren.\n\nTogether, we can work with our military to fight climate change. https://t.co/fYixnw11bz — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) May 19, 2019\n\nThe far-left Senator's comments come weeks after she unveiled a series of new government programs that economists say will cost US taxpayers trillions per year.\n\nIf we put a 2% tax on the wealthiest families in the country, we can provide universal Pre-K, universal free college, knock back student loan debt for 95% of Americans—and still have a trillion dollars leftover, claimed Warren on social media.\n\nIf we put a 2% tax on the wealthiest families in the country, we can provide universal Pre-K, universal free college, knock back student loan debt for 95% of Americans—and still have a trillion dollars leftover. #WarrenTownHall pic.twitter.com/1MMM1eOghf — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) April 23, 2019\n\nAccording to leading economists, the Senator's proposal to forgive student loan debt and introduce tuition-free public colleges would cost over $1.25 trillion over the next decade.
A record-setting number of Americans are back to work under President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress, hitting new heights just months after the GOP-sponsored tax cuts were signed into law.\n\nAccording to CNS News, a whopping 155,965,000 Americans were employed in July; the 11th time the record has been broken since President Trump's inauguration in January 2017.\n\nThe Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics says a record 155,965,000 people were employed in July, the 11th record-breaker since President Trump took office 19 months ago, writes CNS.\n\nOur economy is soaring. Our jobs are booming. Factories are pouring back into our country, they're coming from all over the world. We are defending our workers, President Trump said at a raucous rally in Pennsylvania this week.\n\nThe strong data also showed the unemployment rate plunging to just 3.9% after the US economy added over 150,000 jobs in July.\n\nRead the full report here.
Far-left Senator Elizabeth Warren will reportedly introduce new legislation in the coming days to implement an Ultra Wealth tax on the richest Americans; a move to reduce income inequality in the United States.\n\nSince the pandemic crisis started, billionaire wealth has shot up 40%, while millions remain unemployed and families struggle to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table. It's time for a #WealthTax to make ultra-millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) March 1, 2021\n\nRight now, we live in an America tilted toward the ultra-rich and the powerful, posted Warren on social media.\n\nThis would generate at least $3 trillion for President Biden's big agenda to #BuildBackBetter: expanding the caregiving economy from child care to nursing homes, rebuilding infrastructure, high quality k-12 education, and tuition-free public college and technical schools. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) March 1, 2021\n\nToday, with @PramilaJayapal & @RepBrendanBoyle, I'm introducing a bill for a two-cent #WealthTax on net worths above $50 million—a few cents more for billionaires. This will raise at least $3 trillion to #BuildBackBetter and increase opportunity for all, she added.\n\nA #WealthTax is critical for raising revenue, and that revenue is critical for raising opportunity. We build a future for all of our kids by investing in opportunity. This is one way we can make this government work for everyone—not just the rich and powerful, posted the Senator.
Senator Bernie Sanders echoed the former Soviet Union on social media Thursday when he bizarrely stated that it's time for austerity for the billionaire class to provide for lower-income Americans during the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\n$4.7 billion a day. $32 billion a week. $141 billion a month. $845 billion over 6 months. That's how much 643 billionaires in America made during the pandemic, while 30 million Americans don't have enough food to eat. Yes.

From Fox News:\n\nThe Philadelphia arm of the Black Lives Matter movement has called for the complete abolition of the police department in five years as well as the scrapping of military bases abroad.\n\nFor more than a month, in the aftermath of George Floyd's death, the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement has called for sweeping changes across the country in the bid to end racial injustices. At the heart of the debate is the campaign to defund – or dismantle – police departments.\n\nAnd according to BLM Philadelphia representative and activist YahNé Ndgo, the chapter has developed a five-year plan to do just that.\n\nOne of the things that we are demanding over five years is the complete abolition. We don't want to see any police in our community, Ndgo told Fox News in an interview Tuesday. Over the course of those five years, it gives time for the community to begin to build what is needed. We aren't looking to leave any kind of vacancy around the issue of safety.\n\nFrom her purview, one of the main factors leading to crime is poverty and hunger – which in turn drives drug use and drug-related crimes.\n\nNdgo said helping drug addicts would address many societal ills.\n\nAs we address these particular concerns, and at the same time build restorative justice practices, and build out our mental health response teams, and build medic responses, she said, [These are] responses that really actually deal with the issues that are in place. Then we will have less crime anyway.
Cuomo pleads with fleeing New Yorkers — 'Come back, I will cook for you\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo begged his state's richest residents to return to the Big Apple last week; offering to cook them dinner after the region's wealthiest citizens fled to other locations during the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nI literally talk to people all day long who are now in their Hamptons house who also lived here, or in their Hudson Valley house, or in their Connecticut weekend house, and I say, 'You got to come back! We'll go to dinner! I'll buy you a drink! Come over, I'll cook!' the Democratic governor said Monday.\n\nThey're not coming back right now. And you know what else they're thinking? 'If I stay there, I'll pay a lower income tax,' because they don't pay the New York City surcharge, he added.\n\nIf you pass a piece of legislation that requires New York to raise taxes, raise a millionaires' tax in this environment in New York City, where we're struggling … We used to be worried [with a] millionaires' tax, people might leave, he continued.\n\nNo. The burden shifted. We're trying to get people to come back. We're trying to get them to come back. Covid's under control.\n\nWatch Cuomo's comments above.
Billionaire Bill Gates urged all Americans and residents in other rich countries Tuesday to switch to 100% synthetic beef to combat global warming and climate change in the years ahead.\n\nImpossible and Beyond have a road map, a quality road map and a cost road map, that makes them totally competitive, Gates said, referencing popular plant-based meat corporations. As for scale today, they don't represent 1% of the meat in the world, but they're on their way.\n\nBill Gates: Rich nations should move to 100 percent synthetic beef https://t.co/QS9w2B0fEc pic.twitter.com/hn10E3Dxek — The Hill (@thehill) February 16, 2021\n\nEventually, that green premium is modest enough that you can sort of change the [behavior of] people or use regulation to totally shift the demand, Gates said. So for meat in the middle-income-and-above countries, I do think it's possible.\n\nI do think all rich countries should move to 100% synthetic beef, concluded the Microsoft founder. You can get used to the taste difference, and the claim is they're going to make it taste even better over time.\n\nRead the full report here.
Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez double-down on her demands for a new wealth tax in New York Thursday; saying it's time to tax the rich to prevent working-class families from going hungry in her hometown.\n\nDid you know that there are 118 billionaires… in New York alone? And that they've made billions more during COVID? Did you know that the very workers billionaires rely on are going hungry & without healthcare? This is wrong. If Trump cut their taxes, NY should pick them up, posted AOC on Twitter.\n\nAny budget that's balanced on working people's backs is a budget that will make inequality worse.

The House of Representatives voted Wednesday to delay invoking Articles of Impeachment against President Trump; with Rep.

That's why I'm so disappointed in Speaker Pelosi's bill… It's not a serious effort to legislate. It's dead as fried chicken in the Senate.\n\nSenator, I don't want anyone else to die. I don't want anyone else to get sick. But we did learn from workers that didn't get sick, they wore masks and gloves, said Hannity.\n\nSenator John Kennedy stopped-by 'Hannity' Tuesday night to weigh-in on Speaker Pelosi's latest stimulus package; calling the $3 trillion proposal dead as fried chicken when it reaches the Senate.\n\nHannity: Trump's Tax Plan Will Create Millions of Jobs\n\nposted by Hannity Staff - 6.11.17\n\nSpeaking during his opening monologue in 'Hannity' Wednesday night, Sean praised President Trump's tax plan to cut taxes across the board and unleash the American economy, saying the new policies would create millions of jobs for the forgotten men and women of America.\n\nThe President is following through on what he promised you on the campaign trail, said Sean. If President Trump's plan is approved all of these companies will have billions of dollars, if not more, of extra money. They're not going to put it in their bank accounts. […] They're going to invest capital, manufacturing centers, and factories that will create jobs for the millions of forgotten men and women in this country.\n\nThat's what we need, that's what we want, that's what many of you voted for, he added. Everything that the President is proposing is designed to help grow the economy… In many ways, it's a lot like what President did in the 1980s.\n\nDemocrats and the mainstream left, establishment media, they're not telling you that under President Obama 13 million more Americans were on food stamps, 8 million more Americans were put in poverty, 95 million Americans were out of the labor force, the lowest labor participation rates since the 1970s, said Hannity.\n\nMy advice to the GOP is very simple: Stay the course, follow the Reagan-Kennedy model, and stick to the plan the President is proposing, he added.\n\nWatch Sean's opening monologue above.
Joe Biden continued to confuse millions of viewers on CNN Thursday night; launching a baffling rant about supply chains, products 'Made in America', corporate jobs, and downriver lines… or something.\n\nThey would in fact, denied that opportunity. I would also make it clear when you, in fact, It's gotta be, if any of that is being purchased… It will, we will not… Including the downriver line of what has to be done… You can't do what he's doing now. You can't do where, he's giving tax breaks, and in fact, go overseas, bring there, and then import back! said Biden.\n\nMan, this guy is just so hard to follow pic.twitter.com/TR5VxX2AUp — Benny (@bennyjohnson) September 18, 2020\n\nThe chain is overseas, and they bring it back cheaper.

Fox News is now reporting that Paul Manafort will likely serve his seven year prison sentence in solitary confinement at New York City's Rikers Island; a decision Alan Dershowitz describes as abusive and possibly illegal.\n\nThe decision to move Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman who was sentenced earlier this year to nearly seven years in prison in connection with two federal cases, from the decent federal prison to which he was sentenced to solitary confinement to the dangerous hell hole that is New York City's Rikers Island seems abusive and possibly illegal, writes Alan Dershowitz.\n\nI know Rikers well having spent time there visiting numerous defendants accused of murder and other violent crimes. It is a terrible place that no one should ever be sent to, he adds. It should be shut down. It is so bad that defendants often plead guilty, even if they have defensible cases, simply to move to a safer and better prison.\n\nWhatever the reason for the transfer, it seems like the selective application of the law for partisan purposes. The tactic of squeezing a potential witness by making his imprisonment unbearably harsh is generally reserved for mafioso, terrorists and other violent criminals who may have evidence against their bosses, Dershowitz concludes.\n\nA federal judge added an additional 43 months to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's prison term earlier this year; making his total incarceration time 7 ½ years for tax and bank fraud charges as well as witness tampering.\n\nThe decision came weeks after Manafort was sentenced to 47 months in prison for charges uncovered -yet unrelated- to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 election.\n\n#BREAKING: Second Manafort sentencing puts total prison time at 7 1/2 years https://t.co/FGcr0uow9T pic.twitter.com/BAVPB4ZhrZ — The Hill (@thehill) March 13, 2019\n\nI am sorry for what I have done and for all of the activities that have gotten us here today, said Manafort during the sentencing. I know that it was my conduct that brought me here today. For that, I am remorseful.\n\nThe additional time is related to charges of witness tampering and foreign laundering.\n\nRead Dershowitz' full response here.
Congressional Democrats in the House of Representatives moved this week to block President Trump from using taxpayer money for his proposed border wall; effectively preventing the Commander-in-Chief from declaring a national emergency to begin construction.\n\nRep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis., and five other Democrats proposed the bill, on the same day Trump vowed to build his wall one way or another, writes the Washington Examiner.\n\nMy bill, the No Taxpayer Funding for the Wall Act, will block the president from executing his reckless plan and force him to honor his pledge that Mexico will fund the wall, said Moore.\n\nI call on both Democrats and Republicans to join me in my effort by supporting this commonsense legislation to protect the American public's tax dollars, she said. We must pass this bill to ensure that President Trump can no longer hold the American people hostage.\n\nRead the full report at the Washington Examiner.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren is poised to unveil her wealth tax against high-income Americans and those with over $50 million in miscellaneous assets in the coming days, reports CNBC.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is planning to propose a 'wealth tax' on some of the richest Americans, an economist who advises her told CNBC on Thursday, writes CNBC.\n\nThe new tax from Warren, who recently announced her bid to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020, would only apply to Americans with more than $50 million in assets, adds the site.\n\nThe Warren wealth tax is pretty big. We think it could have a significant affect on wealth concentration in the long run, said her economic advisor. This is a very interesting development with deep root causes: the fact inequality has been increasing so much, particularly in wealth, and the feeling our current tax system doesn't do a very good job taxing the very richest people.\n\nRead the full report at CNBC.

The fiery judge presiding over the special counsel's tax fraud case against former Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort suddenly delayed new testimony Friday, following a strong push back form Mueller's team.\n\nJudge T.S. Ellis III mysteriously delayed testimony Friday in the case of ex-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, pushing off the day's proceedings for hours after prosecutors once again complained about his criticism of them, writes Fox News.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied access to the country for Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib Thursday; saying they routinely deny Israel's legitimacy and call for a boycott against the Jewish State.\n\nRead his full statement below:\n\nNo country in the world respects America and the American Congress more than the State of Israel. As a free and vibrant democracy, Israel is open to critics and criticism with one exception: Israeli law prohibits the entry into Israel of those who call for and work to impose boycotts on Israel, as do other democracies that prohibit the entry of people who seek to harm the country.\n\nIn fact, in the past the US did this to an Israeli member of Knesset, as well as to other public figures from around the world. Congresswomen Tlaib and Omar are leading activists in promoting the legislation of boycotts against Israel in the American Congress.\n\nOnly a few days ago, we received their itinerary for their visit in Israel, which revealed that they planned a visit whose sole objective is to strengthen the boycott against us and deny Israel's legitimacy.\n\nFor instance: they listed the destination of their trip as Palestine and not Israel, and unlike all Democratic and Republican members of Congress who have visited Israel, they did not request to meet any Israeli officials, either from the government or the opposition.\n\nA week ago, Israel warmly welcomed some 70 Democratic and Republican members of Congress, who expressed broad bipartisan support for Israel, which was also demonstrated a month ago in a resounding bipartisan vote against BDS in Congress.\n\nHowever, the itinerary of the two Congresswomen reveals that the sole purpose of their visit is to harm Israel and increase incitement against it.\n\nIn addition, the organization that is funding their trip is Miftah, which is an avid supporter of BDS, and among whose members are those who have expressed support for terrorism against Israel.\n\nTherefore, the minister of interior has decided not to allow their visit, and I, as prime minister, support his decision.\n\nNonetheless, if Congresswoman Tlaib submits a humanitarian request to visit her relatives, the minister of interior has announced that he will consider her request on the condition that she pledges not to act to promote boycotts against Israel during her visit.

The allies, growing increasingly nervous about Biden's verbal flubs, have said it's an approach that's been suggested to campaign officials on the heels of the former vice president's stumbles.\n\nHe needs to be a strong force on the campaign trail, but he also has to pace himself, said one insider.\n\nI think you'll see the same schedule and maybe even more Joe Biden, one ally said. Everyone wants to see Joe Biden be Joe Biden. If he's held back in any way, that's almost the antithesis of who he is.\n\nI think it's the wrong approach, they added.\n\nJoe Biden has spoken his mind his entire life, which voters know and love about him, said Biden's deputy campaign manager. He's a real person, he's authentic, and that will never change. He's going to keep taking on Trump and making the case to voters about the stakes we face in this election, regardless of how the press chooses to cover him.\n\nPresident Trump routinely refers to Biden as sleepy Joe.

Trump added that he is pressuring individual states to follow suit, reports Fox News.\n\nThe debt of these disabled veterans will be completely erased, Trump said. That's hundreds of millions of dollars of student loans debt for our disabled veterans that will be completely erased.\n\nIt was my honor to sign a Presidential Memorandum facilitating the cancellation of student loan debt for 25K of our most severely disabled Veterans.

For more than 40 years, we have had an affordable housing crisis in America that has only gotten worse. In America today, over 18 million families are paying more than 50 percent of their income on housing, while last year alone the five largest banks on Wall Street made a record-breaking $111 billion in profits.\n\nIf we are serious about addressing the affordable housing crisis, we need to build millions of apartments and homes throughout the country that will remain affordable in perpetuity to prevent displacement and serve future generations. And when we do that, we will create millions of good-paying jobs in the process, adds Bernie.\n\nThe new proposal calls for $1.48 trillion to build, rehabilitate, and preserve affordable housing across the United States.\n\nIt calls for an additional $400 billion to construct 2 million new units and $500 million for development in rural areas.\n\nRead Sanders' full plan here.

In 1998, he was convicted for failing to report a felony regarding payment demanded for a riverboat casino license, and he was sentenced to 2 years' probation. Mr. DeBartolo did not allow his conviction to define his life. He remained a generous philanthropist and passionate supporter of numerous charitable causes, including charter schools like the Brooks DeBartolo Collegiate High School, and anti-gang violence initiatives. His exceptional compassion and warmth define his character to this day. Mr. DeBartolo treated players and coaches as part of his family. Many prominent individuals from the National Football League have strongly advocated for this pardon, including Joe Montana, Jim Brown, Jerry Rice, Steve Young, Ronnie Lott, Charles Haley, Derrick Brooks, Fred Dean, Robert Kraft, Jerry Jones, and Roger Goodell. They have been joined in their support by other notable figures and organizations, including Pastor Darrell Scott, Kareem Lanier, Paul Anka, and the Urban Revitalization Coalition.\n\nMichael Milken, one of America's greatest financiers, pioneered the use of high-yield bonds in corporate finance. His innovative work greatly expanded access to capital for emerging companies. By enabling smaller players to access the financing they needed to compete, Mr. Milken's efforts helped create entire industries, such as wireless communications and cable television, and transformed others, like home building. Mr. Milken's work also democratized corporate finance by providing women and minorities access to capital that would have been unavailable to them otherwise. In 1989, at the height of his finance career, Mr. Milken was charged in an indictment alleging that some of his innovative financing mechanisms were in fact criminal schemes. The charges filed against Mr. Milken were truly novel. In fact, one of the lead prosecutors later admitted that Mr. Milken had been charged with numerous technical offenses and regulatory violations that had never before been charged as crimes. Though he initially vowed to fight the charges, Mr. Milken ultimately pled guilty in exchange for prosecutors dropping criminal charges against his younger brother. As a result, Mr. Milken served 2 years in prison in the early 1990s. Since his release, Mr. Milken has dedicated his life to philanthropy, continuing charitable work that he began before his indictment. Over the years, Mr. Milken—either personally or through foundations he created—has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in critical funding to medical research, education, and disadvantaged children. Mr. Milken's philanthropy has been particularly influential in the fight against prostate cancer and has been credited with saving many lives. This pardon has widespread and longstanding support, including from the following individuals: Dr. Miriam Adelson, Sheldon Adelson, David Bahnsen, Tom Barrack, Maria Bartiromo, Ron Burkle, Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, William Ford, Josh Friedman, Rudy Guiliani, Josh Harris, Rabbi Marvin Hier, Ray Irani, Robert Kraft, Richard LeFrak, Randy Levine, Howard Lorber, Representative Kevin McCarthy, Larry Mizel, Arte Moreno, Rupert Murdoch, Sean Parker, John Paulson, Nelson Peltz, Steven Roth, David Rubenstein, Larry Ruvo, Marc Stern, Steven Tananbaum, Ted Virtue, Andrew von Eschenbach, Mark Weinberger, and Gary Winnick.\n\nAriel Friedler was a successful entrepreneur, and built a successful technology company that employed more than 150 people and served more than 41 million students, staff, employers, and government constituents worldwide. In 2014, while serving as President and Chief Executive Officer of the company, Mr. Friedler pled guilty to conspiracy to access a protected computer without authorization and served 2 months in prison. As a result of this incident, he was forced to sell the company that he had dedicated his life to building. During the investigation, his time in prison, and after his release, Mr. Friedler expressed deep remorse for his actions. Since his release, Mr. Friedler has volunteered his time and expertise to promoting veterans issues and helping former prisoners reenter and rejoin society. In recognition of his rehabilitation, the State of Florida restored his license to practice law. Among those who support this grant of clemency are former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Rabbi Katz of the Aleph Institute.\n\nBernard Kerik courageously led the New York Police Department's heroic response to the horrific attacks of September 11, 2001, as Commissioner of the New York Police Department. He embodied the strength, courage, compassion, and spirit of the people of New York and this great Nation as he served alongside first responders at the World Trade Center in the aftermath of the attack. In 2010, Mr. Kerik was sentenced to 4 years' imprisonment for tax fraud and for making false statements. Since his conviction, he has focused on improving the lives of others, including as a passionate advocate for criminal justice and prisoner reentry reform. His 30 years of law enforcement service and tenure as Commissioner of the New York City Department of Correction have given him a unique understanding and perspective on criminal justice and prisoner reentry reform, and he remains an invaluable contributor to these endeavors. Mr. Kerik is the recipient of countless awards for meritorious and heroic service, including a Presidential Commendation for Heroism from President Ronald Reagan. Among others, this pardon is supported by Rudy Giuliani, Judge Andrew Napolitano, Geraldo Rivera, Charlie Daniels, Chief Paul Cell, Judge Ray Reddin, Former Chief of the Passaic County Sheriff's Department John Comparetto, Representative Peter King, Christopher Ruddy, Chief and Mrs. Eddie Gallagher, and Sidney Powell.\n\nPaul Pogue was the owner of a successful construction company and made significant charitable contributions every year. An audit by the Internal Revenue Service discovered that Mr. Pogue had underpaid his taxes over a 3-year period by approximately 10 percent. Immediately upon learning of the tax deficiency, Mr. Pogue paid restitution, interest, and penalties. To avoid the cost and burden of fighting the charges, which could have put at risk the jobs of the 150 people employed by his company, Mr. Pogue agreed to plead guilty and was sentenced to 3 years of probation. Despite his conviction, Mr. Pogue never stopped his charitable work. For more than 30 years, he has provided significant humanitarian aid to countries around the world, including Africa, India, and Mexico, all while continuing to help his fellow Americans in times of need. Mr. Pogue is the founder of two non-profit organizations. One constructs churches, clinics, schools, and orphanages in developing countries. The other provides disaster relief to communities in need. Following Hurricane Harvey, his charity provided critical support to Texans rebuilding their lives in the wake of the storm. In addition, Mr. Pogue's non-profit flies medical teams into disaster areas and flies people in need of medical treatment to doctors and hospitals. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, Mike Buster, Steve Dulin, Robert Morris, Jack Graham, and James Robison are among the many people who support this grant of clemency.\n\nDavid Safavian has dedicated his life to criminal justice reform after serving nearly a year in prison. Mr. Safavian was convicted of making false statements and of obstructing an investigation into a trip he took while he was a senior government official. Having served time in prison and completed the process of rejoining society with a felony conviction, Mr. Safavian is uniquely positioned to identify problems with the criminal justice system and work to fix them. Mr. Safavian is a fierce advocate for policy changes that improve public safety, protect families and victims, and reduce recidivism, including the First Step Act, which provides prisoners with a second chance through rehabilitative programs, fair sentencing, and smart confinement. The District of Columbia restored his license to practice law, and his pardon is supported by several prominent individuals, including Van Jones, Matt Schlapp, Mercedes Schlapp, Doug Deason, Mark Holden, Topeka Sam, Dan Schneider, and Jessica Jackson.\n\nAngela Stanton overcame a difficult childhood to become a champion for redemption and rehabilitation for all who strive for a better life. In 2007, she served a 6-month home confinement sentence for her role in a stolen vehicle ring. Today, Ms. Stanton is a national best-selling author, widely acclaimed television personality, and proponent of criminal justice reform. She works tirelessly to improve reentry outcomes for people returning to their communities upon release from prison, focusing on the critical role of families in the process. This pardon is supported by Alveda King.\n\nIn light of the decisions these individuals have made following their convictions to work to improve their communities and our Nation, the President has determined that they are each deserving of full pardons.\n\nIn addition, the President is commuting the sentences of four individuals who have paid their debts to society and have worked to improve their lives and the lives of others while incarcerated.\n\nRod Blagojevich was the Governor of Illinois from 2003 until 2009, when he was charged with, among other things, offering an appointment to the United States Senate in exchange for campaign contributions. He was convicted of those charges and sentenced to 14 years in prison. Although the Seventh Circuit reversed some of his convictions related to the Senate appointment, it did not alter his 14-year sentence. He has spent 8 years in prison. People from across the political spectrum and from varied backgrounds have expressed support for shortening Mr. Blagojevich's sentence, including Senator Dick Durbin, Reverend Jesse Jackson, Sr., former Representative Bob Barr, Representatives Bobby Rush and Danny Davis, former Attorney General Eric Holder, and Bishop Byron Brazier. Additionally, more than a hundred of Mr. Blagojevich's fellow inmates have written letters in support of reducing his sentence. During his confinement, Mr. Blagojevich has demonstrated exemplary character, devoting himself to improving the lives of his fellow prisoners. He tutors and teaches GED classes, mentors prisoners regarding personal and professional development, and speaks to them about their civic duties. Notwithstanding his lengthy sentence, Mr. Blagojevich also counsels inmates to believe in the justice system and to use their time in prison for self-improvement. His message has been to keep faith, overcome fear, and never give up.\n\nTynice Nichole Hall is a 36-year-old mother who has served nearly 14 years of an 18-year sentence for allowing her apartment to be used to distribute drugs. While in prison, Ms. Hall has completed a number of job-training programs and apprenticeships, as well as coursework towards a college degree.

Far-left Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posted a video on social media Friday claiming President Trump is scared because most Americans prefer her socialist proposals.\n\nI think he's scared… It shows that we've gotten under his skin.

ANTI-SOCIAL MEDIA: Google Engineer Says He Was Fired, Blacklisted for 'Conservative Views'\n\nposted by Hannity Staff - 8.01.19\n\nA former Google employee accused the technology company of terminating his position over his conservative views this week, saying the media giant routinely censors their employees and their political opinions.\n\nKevin Cernekee was still a 'Noogler'—Google's term for a new employee—when his conservative take on political and social issues raised hackles within the search giant, reports the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAfter several posts on the company's freewheeling internal message boards in early 2015 rankled some colleagues, he was given an official warning from human resources about conduct deemed disrespectful and insubordinate. Around that time, a senior manager wrote on the boards that he added Mr. Cernekee to a 'written blacklist' of employees he wouldn't work with, adds the WSJ.\n\nHistorically, there's been a lot of bullying at Google, Cernekee said. There's a big political angle, and they treat the two sides very differently.\n\nAnother software engineer at Google blew the whistle on the company's political bias last week; telling Project Veritas the giant corporation censors conservatives and has largely merged with the Democratic Party.\n\n⚡️GOOGLE ENGINEER BLOWS WHISTLE: Are we going to just let the biggest tech companies decide who wins every election from now on? #GoogleExposed pic.twitter.com/EKsmdTZ0ML — Project Veritas (@Project_Veritas) July 24, 2019\n\nI'm a senior software engineer.

FLASHBACK: Hypocrite Hillary Says Questioning Election a National 'Threat'\n\nposted by Hannity Staff - 2.07.17\n\nFormer Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton hypocritically suggested the 2016 general election may be illegitimate on Monday, despite viciously attacking then-candidate Donald Trump for similar comments he made on the campaign trail last fall.\n\nClinton raised eyebrows on Monday when she shockingly refused to rule out the possibility that the entire 2016 general election may be illegitimate, bizarrely suggesting the United States Supreme Court may have to mediate the constitutional crisis.\n\nHillary was singing a very different tune prior to election day, smearing the GOP candidate for suggesting voter fraud and a rigged system could undermine the American election system.\n\nHe said a lot of things throughout those three debates. But I've got to tell you there's one in particular… out of that third debate that no presidential nominee of either party has ever said before, said Clinton prior to Election Day.\n\nHe refused to say that he would respect the results of our election. I have to admit when we were both asked the question I assumed he would say what everybody has always said, which is, 'Of course,' she added.\n\nTo say you won't respect the results of the election, that is a direct threat to our democracy, said Hillary.\n\nWatch Hillary's hypocritical comments above.

This wealth tax would only apply to net worth of over $32 million and would raise an estimated $4.35 trillion over the next decade. Anyone who has a net worth of less than $32 million would not see their taxes go up at all under this plan.\n\nThe tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion. These brackets are halved for singles, adds Bernie.
A report from the New York Post is shedding more light on Joe Biden's progressive tax plan; claiming some residents in deep-blue states could witness a 58% tax hike under his current proposals.\n\nHigh earners in New York and New Jersey could see federal and state tax rates of more than 58 percent under former Vice President Joe Biden's tax proposals, according to an analysis of the plan, reports the NY Post. While Biden would slice taxes for Americans earning under $400,000, those making more than that would face double-digit increases, the Washington, DC-based Tax Foundation found.\n\nThe Empire State could see a 58.2 percent increase, while New Jersey's would rise to slightly more than 60 percent and California would hit 62 percent, according to an analysis by Jared Walczak of the Tax Foundation, adds the newspaper.\n\nThe report comes exactly two weeks before millions of Americans head to polling stations across the country.\n\nLatest surveys show Donald Trump and Joe Biden neck-and-neck in the key battleground states that will decide the general election.\n\nRead the full report in the New York Post.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis unveiled a series of new proposals to help his state recover from the Coronavirus shutdown; including a 'hurricane tax holiday' and Co-VID testing sites at Home Depot and Publix grocery stores.\n\nWe want all Floridians to be prepared. … Let's prepare for the worst but hope for the best when it comes to hurricane season, he said at a press conference at a Home Depot in Boca Raton.\n\nWe want it to be as convenient as possible for people, DeSantis said.\n\nDeSantis ripped the mainstream media Wednesday on their reaction to his decision to re-open the state; saying his virus response challenged their assumptions and they were trying to find a boogeyman.\n\nWe've succeeded and I think that people just don't want to recognize it because it challenges their narrative, it challenges their assumption, so they have to try and find a boogeyman, said DeSantis.\n\nGov. @RonDeSantisFL tears into the media: We've succeeded and I think that people just don't want to recognize it because it challenges their narrative, it challenges their assumption, so they have to try and find a boogeyman.pic.twitter.com/dcgSAdOfms — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) May 20, 2020\n\nWatch DeSantis' comments above.
Former President Donald Trump released an official statement Monday after the Supreme Court issued a ruling that would likely allow his political opponents to access his private and business tax returns.\n\nSo now, for more than two years, New York City has been looking at almost every transaction I've ever done, including seeking tax returns which were done by among the biggest and most prestigious law and accounting firms in the U.S. The Tea Party was treated far better by the IRS than Donald Trump. The Supreme Court never should have let this 'fishing expedition' happen, but they did. This is something which has never happened to a President before, it is all Democrat-inspired in a totally Democrat location, New York City and State, completely controlled and dominated by a heavily reported enemy of mine, Governor Andrew Cuomo, writes the President.\n\nIn the meantime, murders and violent crime are up in New York City by record numbers, and nothing is done about it. Our elected officials don't care. All they focus on is the persecution of President Donald J. Trump, he adds.\n\nI will fight on, just as I have, for the last five years (even before I was successfully elected), despite all of the election crimes that were committed against me. We will win! Trump concludes.\n\nRead the statement in its entirety here.
Former New York City Mayor and likely 2020 presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg unloaded on members of his own party this week; equating Sen. Warren's tax plan with Venezuela and saying the US can't afford Sen. Harris' healthcare proposal.\n\nIf you want to look at a system that's non-capitalistic, just take a look at what was perhaps the wealthiest country in the world, and today, people are starving to death — it's called Venezuela, said Bloomberg -referencing Warren's proposed tax hikes.\n\nBloomberg on Warren's proposed wealth tax: If you want to look at a system that's non-capitalistic, just take a look at what was perhaps the wealthiest country in the world, and today, people are starving to death — it's called Venezuela. pic.twitter.com/GlG8tNcvWv — David Wright (@DavidWright_CNN) January 29, 2019\n\nI think you could never afford that.

Controversial Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez urged Democrat Governor Andrew Cuomo to impose a new wealth tax on the state's richest residents; placing more pressure on the region's dwindling population following Coronavirus and anti-police protests.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pushed Gov. Andrew Cuomo to tax billionaires who live in New York state and use the money to aid people hurt by the coronavirus-induced economic crisis, reports Fox News. Under the bill, sponsored by Jessica Ramos, a state senator from Queens, the unrealized capital gains of the state's billionaires would be taxed. It would raise an estimated $5.5 billion in revenue, which would go toward workers not eligible for unemployment benefits or federal relief measures.\n\nWe need you to pass a billionaire's tax, in order to make sure that we're providing for our working families, Ocasio-Cortez said in a video released by the group on Thursday. It's time to stop protecting billionaires, and it's time to start working for working families.\n\nMore than 500,000 people have left New York City since the Coronavirus crisis began in March.\n\nRead the full report at Fox News.
Controversial Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ripped the American capitalist system ahead of Memorial Day Weekend; sarcastically stating real great system we got here.\n\nReally great system we got here. Can't imagine why anyone would question how beneficial or sustainable it is for the working class, posted AOC on Twitter.\n\nReally great system we got here.

AOC had founded Brook Avenue Press, a publishing house that sought designers, artists and writers from urban areas to help paint The Bronx in a positive way in children's stories, in 2012.\n\nAs the Post previously reported, public records show the state dissolved the company in October 2016. The state can make such a move when a business fails to pay corporate taxes or file a return, adds the Post. The state Tax Department then filed a warrant against her now-defunct business on July 6, 2017, over a $1,618.36 unpaid bill.\n\nShe just thinks she's better than everyone else. Clearly, she's worse, said Hank Sheinkopf, spokesman for AOC's chief June primary-race opponent, Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, to The Post.\n\nThe congresswoman is still in the process of contesting the tax warrant. The business has been closed for several years now, and so we believe that the state Tax Department has continued to collect the franchise tax in error, said Lauren Hitt, an AOC spokeswoman.\n\nRead the full report at the New York Post.
Senator Elizabeth Warren ripped fiscally-conservative politicians on social media Monday; asserting that there's always enough money to help finance massive government entitlement programs.\n\nCan you assure the American people that Democrats won't give in to this fake concern about the debt? asked MSNBC's Joy Reid.\n\nWe can't play by two different sets of rules. When Republicans are in the majority and they want to cut taxes, they say, 'Debt doesn't matter!' But when Democrats are in the majority… suddenly they say, 'No, you can't do that!' said Warren before the election.\n\nThat is over. No. The Republicans were never serious about debt. They were serious about not taxing rich people, she added.\n\nThere's always enough money when Republicans want tax breaks for billionaires and giant corporations – just not when we want to help struggling families. Spare us your crocodile tears about exploding national debt, @GOP. It's not going to work. pic.twitter.com/VaUhQ9H6EG — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) November 9, 2020\n\nThere's always enough money when Republicans want tax breaks for billionaires and giant corporations – just not when we want to help struggling families.

The Department of Justice has spent over $17 million on its investigation into Russian election interference since last May, says a new financial report published Thursday by the DOJ.\n\nThe report shows the department spent nearly $7 million from May 2017 until October 2017, and an additional $10 million to date; bringing the total to over $17 million worth of tax payer money to probe the Kremlin's involvement in the 2016 race for the White House.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller was appointed in May 2017 after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from any investigation into the Trump campaign, setting the stage for the high-stakes showdown between the President and the special counsel.\n\nThe President slammed the report Thursday, saying At what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 Witch Hunt, composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years, STOP!
BLUE STATE BLUES: Liberal Governors to SUE TRUMP ADMIN Over GOP Tax Cuts\n\nposted by Hannity Staff - 1.26.18\n\nNew York's Andrew Cuomo announced his plans Friday to form a coalition of 'Blue State' Governors and sue the federal government over the recently passed GOP tax legislation; saying the bill unfairly punishes east coast residents with drastically higher property taxes.\n\nJust three states -New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut- have signed onto Cuomo's initiative, but the group hopes to expand to California, Illinois, and other left-leaning local governments as the Republican tax cuts take effect in the coming months.\n\nAccording to Fox News, the coalition blasted the legislation's State and Local Tax Deduction, also known as SALT provision, which eliminates individual's abilities to deduct state and local taxes from their federal filings; making people in high-tax states likely to pay more on their annual tax bill.\n\nThe elimination of full state and local deductibility is a blatantly partisan and unlawful attack on New York that uses our hardworking families and tax dollars as a piggy bank to pay for tax cuts for corporations and other states, Cuomo said in a statement. This coalition will take the federal government to court to protect our residents from this assault.\n\nCapping the State and Local Tax deduction had nothing to do with sound policy, added New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy. It is a clear and politically motivated punishment of blue states — like New Jersey and our neighbors —who already pay far more to the federal government than we receive.\n\nCuomo's lawsuit is the latest instance of Democratic leaders struggling to stop the President's tax overhaul. Earlier this month, California announced its intention to seize half the tax cut revenue of all corporations earning over $1 million.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded to fierce criticism of her handling of Amazon's plan to scrap their plans for a new headquarters in NYC Friday; bizarrely suggesting the city spend the non-existent tax breaks on teachers, subways, and putting people to work.\n\nWhat do you say to those who say the district is now going to lose 25,000 jobs, asked one reporter.\n\nRep. @AOC calls out @JeffBezos and the celebrates @amazon pulling out of its planned #HQ2 site in NYC.

They can have more say than the richest man in the world, said Cortez.\n\nWe were subsidizing those jobs. The city was paying for those jobs. If we were willing to give away $3 billion on this deal, we could invest those $3 billion in our district, in ourselves if we wanted to. We could hire more teachers, we could fix our subways, we could put a lot of people to work for that money, she added.
Sen. Bernie Sanders reiterated his call for 'Medicare for All' Tuesday; demanding the government program cover out of pocket expenses for all Americans during the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nRather than subsidize the insurance industry's profits, we can pursue a simpler, cost-effective, and comprehensive solution for health care. For the duration of this pandemic, Medicare should cover all out-of-pocket expenses for all Americans, posted Sanders on social media.\n\nRather than subsidize the insurance industry's profits, we can pursue a simpler, cost-effective, and comprehensive solution for health care.

Our Health Care Emergency Guarantee Act is more comprehensive than Trump's vague proposal and less expensive than the Democrats' COBRA expansion, writes Sanders.\n\nRead the full report at Politico.
President Trump called-out liberal legislators and the mainstream media Friday morning; accusing the lawmakers of rooting against the United States in its negotiations with North Korea while rushing to the defense of MS-13 gang members.\n\nThe Commander-in-Chief slammed Congressional Democrats on social media, saying they were obviously rooting against his administration in its attempt to completely denuclearize the Korean peninsula.\n\nDemocrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with North Korea.

New Jersey Senator Cory Booker refused to rule-out a series of tax hikes should he win the White House over the weekend; saying America is far more patriotic than people are expressing and citizens now need to invest in each other.\n\nWe live in a nation with far more patriotism than people are expressing, Booker said. What I mean is folks want the best for the country. We know if your family doesn't have a great public school, great health care, we're all suffering and creating greater costs.\n\nI'm going to run a campaign that speaks to all of America… I don't think Democrats should be defined by beating Republicans, he added.

The French government is poised to implement a new digital tax on large corporations -such as Google, Amazon and others- that generate a substantial amount of revenue through online sales and shipping.\n\nThe levy of as much as 5 percent of French sales will start Jan. 1 and potentially raise about 500 million euros ($570 million) for the state, reports Bloomberg. Under the plan, which the cabinet will discuss on Wednesday, the tax will apply to any company with global revenue of more than 750 million euros and French sales above 25 million euros.\n\nThe new tax scheme comes just months after the so-called 'Yellow Vest' protests swept through France, with angry residents clashing with police over high energy costs, massive taxes, lack of employment, and other issues.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to overhaul the nation's tax code in recent weeks but is struggling to cope with plummeting poll numbers and a series of economic challenges.\n\nRead the full report at Bloomberg.
The United States Treasury collected a record-breaking amount of personal income taxes in May; smashing estimates during the first eight months of the 2018 Fiscal Year with no signs of slowing down.\n\nAccording to CNS News, the US federal government raked in a whopping $1.1 trillion in personal income taxes, breaking the previous record by over $56 billion.\n\nThe approximately $1,143,141,000,000 in individual income taxes that the Treasury collected in October through May of this fiscal year was $56,273,800,000 more (in constant May 2018 dollars) than the $1,086,867,200,000 (in constant May 2018 dollars) in individual income taxes that the Treasury collected in October through May of fiscal 2016—which was the previous record, writes CSN.\n\nThe strong tax haul comes on the heels of another report that showed the number of Americans receiving food assistance fell to its lowest level in over eight years; yet another sign of a robust US economy under President Trump heading into the 2018 midterm elections.

Home Depot founders Bernie Marcus and Ken Langone spoke with Fox Business this week; saying Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is the biggest enemy of every entrepreneur in the United States.\n\nDo you get annoyed when you have big old targets, not specifically on you, but that the rich, all these Democratic candidates, to a man and woman, they single out guys like you as, this is what has happened to capitalism. Unfair, asked host Neil Cavuto.\n\nBernie Sanders is out today with a plan that will tax Wall Street trades pennies on the dollar. But it's a start to pay for, among other things, college debt and maybe free college down the road, he added.\n\nWell, look, don't bring up Bernie Sanders, because that's a red flag in front of me, because he's the enemy of every entrepreneur that's ever going to be born in this country and has been born in the past, said Marcus.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., will propose on Monday eliminating all $1.6 trillion of student debt held in the United States, a significant escalation of the policy fight in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary two days before the candidates' first debate in Miami, reports the Stamford Advocate.\n\nSanders is proposing that the federal government pay to wipe clean the student debt held by 45 million Americans – including all private and graduate school debt – as part of a package that also would make public universities, community colleges and trade schools tuition-free, adds the newspaper.\n\nSanders confirmed last week that his socialized health care proposal will absolutely provide coverage to every single illegal immigrant in the United States.\n\nWe will organize the American people around the concept that all people in this country have the right to health care, and at the end of the day, we are going to win that struggle, said Sanders during a recent speech.\n\nSenator, would you include the 11 million undocumented immigrants in America? asked the moderator.\n\nAbsolutely. When I talk about health care being a human right, the last time I heard that undocumented people are human beings, he fired-back.
Millennials and young Americans are increasingly blaming climate change for their lack of personal savings accounts and retirement plans; saying current weather trends make it near impossible to forecast their economic future.\n\nMany young people today think civilization may not exist when they're of retirement age, writes Market Watch. Some 88% of millennials — a higher percentage than any other age group — accept that climate change is happening, and 69% say it will impact them in their lifetimes. Engulfed in a constant barrage of depressing news stories, many young people are skeptical about saving for an uncertain future.\n\nI want to hope for the best and plan for a future that is stable and secure, but, when I look at current events and at the world we are predicting, I do not see how things could not be chaotic in 50 years, said a 27-year-old communications professional from New York City. The weather systems are already off, and I don't think it's hyperbolic to be a little apocalyptic.\n\nAccording to Pew, two-thirds of Millennials (those born between 1981 and 1996) have nothing saved for retirement.\n\nThere is a certain fatalism in this population relative to more recent generations, said one industry expert. Psychologically, this population has had more shocks to expectations about their futures than past generations. From a perception point of view, I hear a lot of cynicism about the ability to build retirement savings or whether they will be able to retire at all.\n\nDespite a lack of savings, the United States economy continues to break record after record under President Trump.\n\nThe American economy smashed expectations in April; adding over 263,000 new jobs that sent the unemployment rate down to just 3.6% -the lowest level on record since December 1969.\n\nThe U.S. jobs machine kept humming along in April, adding a robust 263,000 new hires while the unemployment rate fell to 3.6%, the lowest in a generation, according to a Labor Department report Friday, reports CNBC.\n\nUnemployment was last this low in December 1969 when it hit 3.5%. At a time when many economists see a tight labor market, big job growth continues as the economic expansion is just a few months away from being the longest in history, adds the author.\n\nThe strong data comes as over a dozen Democratic presidential candidates continue to slam the US economy; saying capitalism has failed for many Americans and pledging to repeal President Trump's tax cuts should they take the White House.\n\nRead the full report at Market Watch.
Senator Bernie Sanders is now facing a unique challenge from an unlikely opponent: Elizabeth Warren, with insiders saying the two far-left politicians are facing-off for the progressive base of the Democratic Party.\n\nThe Bernie Sanders campaign, facing a new challenge in the rise of Elizabeth Warren, has settled for now on a careful if sometimes awkward strategy: emphasizing Sanders's unique position in the liberal movement, while avoiding direct attacks on Warren and rolling out plans that overlap with her attention-grabbing ideas, reports the Washington Post.\n\nThat approach was on display Monday as Sanders introduced a proposal to cancel all student debt across the country. His plan came less than two weeks after Warren announced her own idea for scrapping student debt, one that would cover fewer people than Sanders's would. 'Under the proposal we introduced today, all student debt would be canceled in six months,' Sanders said, adds the author.\n\nThe two candidates are currently vying for the official endorsement of liberal superstar Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has a working relationship with both lawmakers.\n\nElizabeth Warren extended her calls for racial reparations this week; saying America's gay and lesbian couples are owed $50 million due to the United States' discriminatory tax code.\n\nIt wasn't until marriage equality became law that gay & lesbian couples could jointly file tax returns—so they paid more in taxes. Our government owes them more than $50M for the years our discriminatory tax code left them out. We must right these wrongs, posted Warren on social media.\n\nIt wasn't until marriage equality became law that gay & lesbian couples could jointly file tax returns—so they paid more in taxes.

That's why I'm calling for something truly transformational — the cancellation of up to $50,000 in student loan debt for 42 million Americans, she adds.\n\nPublic college education is like a public K-12 education — a basic public good that should be available to everyone with free tuition and zero debt at graduation. My plan for universal free college will give every American the opportunity to attend a two-year or four-year public college without paying a dime in tuition or fees, concludes Warren.\n\nRead the full report here.
Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders defended his medicare for all program Monday, blasting the university behind the financial report that claimed his universal coverage scheme would cost US tax payers $32 trillion over ten years.\n\nA scathing report released by George Mason University found Sanders' proposal would cost a stunning $32.6 trillion over the first decade; accounting for over 10% of the United States' entire Gross Domestic Product.\n\nIf every major country on earth can guarantee health care to all, and achieve better health outcomes, while spending substantially less per capita than we do, it is absurd for anyone to suggest that the United States cannot do the same, Sanders said in a statement.\n\nThis grossly misleading and biased report is the Koch brothers response to the growing support in our country for a 'Medicare for all' program, Sanders added.\n\nRead the full report at the Hill.
It calls for an additional $400 billion to construct 2 million new units and $500 million for development in rural areas.\n\nThe new proposal calls for $1.48 trillion to build, rehabilitate, and preserve affordable housing across the United States.\n\nIf we are serious about addressing the affordable housing crisis, we need to build millions of apartments and homes throughout the country that will remain affordable in perpetuity to prevent displacement and serve future generations. And when we do that, we will create millions of good-paying jobs in the process, adds Bernie.\n\nIn the richest country in the history of the world, every American must have a safe, decent, accessible, and affordable home as a fundamental right, writes Sanders. For more than 40 years, we have had an affordable housing crisis in America that has only gotten worse. In America today, over 18 million families are paying more than 50 percent of their income on housing, while last year alone the five largest banks on Wall Street made a record-breaking $111 billion in profits.\n\nFading Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders unveiled his Housing for All plan Wednesday; calling for $2.5 trillion in new spending to expand government programs for low-income Americans.\n\nANOTHER FREEBIE? Bernie Sanders Vows to Provide 'Year-Round, Free Universal School Meals'\n\nposted by Hannity Staff - 8.29.19\n\nVermont Senator and 2020 presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders called for another federal program this week; saying the government should provide year-round, free universal school meals for every student in America.\n\n'School lunch debt' should not exist in the wealthiest country in the history of the world. When we are in the White House, we are going to provide year-round, free universal school meals, posted Sanders on Instagram.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B1wDEhzBuGy/?utm_source=ig_embed\n\nThe school lunch program is the latest far-left proposal from Sanders, whose 'Green New Deal' would effectively nationalize upwards of 30% of the entire American economy.\n\nAtop our existing government spending, comprising some 40% of GDP, the Vermont Senator wouldn't just nationalize one-fifth of the economy with a 'Medicare For all' bill eliminating private health insurance. Under his Green New Deal plan, he would also nationalize most of the energy sector, reports the Washington Examiner.\n\nAt a mere $16.3 trillion, the Sanders plan would go beyond simply spending measures to increase climate-focused research and development. It would literally centralize the means of domestic energy production, adds the Examiner.\n\nWhat we need to do is have an aggressive federal government. You can't nibble around the edges anymore. We need to transform our energy system, that means a massive increase in sustainable energy, Sanders told MSNBC.\n\nSanders says you can't nibble around the edges, proposes government takeover of energy productionhttps://t.co/vvi6qWBsKy pic.twitter.com/0oinlenWbR — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) August 23, 2019\n\nClimate change is a global emergency. The Amazon rainforest is burning, Greenland's ice shelf is melting, and the Arctic is on fire. People across the country and the world are already experiencing the deadly consequences of our climate crisis, as extreme weather events like heat waves, wildfires, droughts, floods, and hurricanes upend entire communities, ecosystems, economies, and ways of life, as well as endanger millions of lives. Communities of color, working class people, and the global poor have borne and will bear this burden disproportionately, writes Sanders.
President Trump trolled French President Emmanuel Macron while touring a factory Friday; suggesting the US has a better president than France when asked to comment on the booming American economy.\n\nYou have a very low unemployment rate in the US, and we have a very high unemployment rate in France. How come? What's the recipe for that? asked a French reporter.\n\nWell maybe we have a better president than you do, joked Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Trump addressed more than 30,000 supporters in Dallas, Texas Thursday night; weighing in on a series of issues including the border, impeachment, his potential Democratic rivals, and the economy.\n\nA massive crowd of approximately 30,000 gathered outside the American Airlines Center to watch the speech on a large screen, as the president launched into an extended critique of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, reports Fox News.\n\nLast week, a very dumb Democrat candidate for president — that's the end of him in this state — pledged to revoke the tax-exempt status of many churches and religious charities, Trump said, referring to comments made by former Congressman Beto O'Rourke. And by the way, that was after, a few weeks ago, he said, 'Excuse me, we're gonna take your guns away.' … The flailer. You remember he was flailing all over the place?\n\nLast month, unemployment reached its lowest level in 51 years, Trump said to applause. 1.3 million children have been lifted out of poverty — think of that. And, African-American, Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels in history. Our great Hispanic American population has reached a poverty level which is an all-time low in U.S. history. … The median income for Hispanic Americans has surpassed $50,000 a year for the first time ever.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., will propose on Monday eliminating all $1.6 trillion of student debt held in the United States, a significant escalation of the policy fight in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary two days before the candidates' first debate in Miami, reports the Stamford Advocate.\n\nSanders is proposing that the federal government pay to wipe clean the student debt held by 45 million Americans – including all private and graduate school debt – as part of a package that also would make public universities, community colleges and trade schools tuition-free, adds the newspaper.\n\nSanders confirmed last week that his socialized health care proposal will absolutely provide coverage to every single illegal immigrant in the United States.\n\nWe will organize the American people around the concept that all people in this country have the right to health care, and at the end of the day, we are going to win that struggle, said Sanders during a recent speech.\n\nSenator, would you include the 11 million undocumented immigrants in America? asked the moderator.\n\nAbsolutely. When I talk about health care being a human right, the last time I heard that undocumented people are human beings, he fired-back.

2020 presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren extended her calls for racial reparations this week; saying America's gay and lesbian couples are owed $50 million due to the United States' discriminatory tax code.\n\nIt wasn't until marriage equality became law that gay & lesbian couples could jointly file tax returns—so they paid more in taxes. Our government owes them more than $50M for the years our discriminatory tax code left them out. We must right these wrongs, posted Warren on social media.\n\nIt wasn't until marriage equality became law that gay & lesbian couples could jointly file tax returns—so they paid more in taxes.

That's why I'm calling for something truly transformational — the cancellation of up to $50,000 in student loan debt for 42 million Americans, she adds.\n\nPublic college education is like a public K-12 education — a basic public good that should be available to everyone with free tuition and zero debt at graduation. My plan for universal free college will give every American the opportunity to attend a two-year or four-year public college without paying a dime in tuition or fees, concludes Warren.\n\nWarren has routinely vowed to remake the American economy on the campaign trail in recent weeks.\n\nAs the 23 candidates seeking the Democratic nomination struggle to distinguish themselves, Senator Elizabeth Warren has set herself apart with a series of sweeping proposals that would significantly remake the American economy, covering everything from tax policy to student debt relief and offering a detailed portrait of what her presidency might look like, reports the New York Times.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren has laid out a series of policies that would significantly remake the American economy.

But the sheer volume of her plans, and their detail and variety, is forcing her rivals to play catch-up and stake out their own positions, adds the Times.\n\nHer proposals allow the federal government to monitor -and in some cases- dictate industry standards, salaries, bonuses, and more. She's also called for the break-up of large technology companies, including Google and Amazon.\n\nRead Warren's full op-ed here.
Published by the Dallas Weekly\n\nIn 2016, I had a straightforward question for Black Americans: What do you have to lose?\n\nBlack Americans don't have to ask what they have to lose in 2020. Instead, the question should now be, how much more do we have to gain?\n\nAs your President, I've done more for the Black community than Democrats like Joe Biden have done in 47 years, and we are going to do so much more. As part of our efforts, we've unveiled my second term agenda called the Platinum Plan for Black Economic Empowerment, to ensure even more Black Americans have the opportunity to succeed over the next four years.\n\nThe plan is built around the pillars of opportunity, security, prosperity and fairness. I've committed to adding 3 million new jobs for the Black community, creating 500,000 new Black-owned businesses and increasing access to capital in Black communities by almost $500 Billion to create an era of new prosperity and to finally close the wealth gap.\n\nWe are increasing access to capital and economic empowerment for the Black community as a way to build Black generational wealth.\n\nI knew that I could do more for Black America than the Democrat Party has ever done because I am about action. In fact, it's the Democrats who exploit the sympathies and trust of Black Americans with false promises and empty rhetoric.\n\nSince I became your President, I've fought for all Americans. Unlike the D.C. political establishment, which looked out for only a small group of elites at the expense of working families — my Administration is empowering all Americans with an agenda that puts you first, because I care.\n\nThe unemployment and poverty rates for Black Americans hit record lows just before we were attacked by the China Virus. Wages are now growing faster than they have in over a decade, especially for blue-collar workers.\n\nMy Administration is fighting to stop illegal immigration, which hurts Black communities, protect school choice, giving parents more options to access better schools for their children, create new and high-paying jobs, and increase investment in low-income areas — these initiatives create unprecedented opportunities for long-forgotten communities across the country.\n\nI was also honored to work with U.S. Senator Tim Scott to create the Opportunity Zones program established through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which has already attracted $75 billion in new private investments and created 500,000 new jobs in struggling, underserved communities.\n\nWhen it comes to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), it was my honor to be the first sitting President to invite all HBCU leaders to the White House, address the HBCU Week Conference and permanently fund these important schools through the FUTURE Act.\n\nI am proud that we also passed landmark criminal justice reform to undo the damage of mass incarceration. This is helping people, who in many cases have served harsh sentences for non-violent crimes, to have a second chance at their American Dream. This is widely viewed as one of the greatest bipartisan victories in a long time, and a testament to what we can achieve together.\n\nWhen there was increased violence and deaths in Democrat-controlled cities, we started Operation Legend, after young LeGend Taliferro and we are seeing results. When lawless criminals kept looting, burning and destroying Black businesses and communities, I said we needed peace, law and order in these same cities to keep communities, and families safe.\n\nIn Black communities across the nation, there's been a reckoning to the reality that the Democrats have failed them for generations. D.C. Democrats are happy to leave urban communities mired with failing schools, no jobs and lost hope while wasting time and taxpayer money on baseless and partisan politics.\n\nThe truth is this: Democrats despise my America First agenda because it broke up their taxpayer-funded gravy train that enriched their friends and families, shipped jobs overseas, supported illegal immigrants and continued endless wars while leaving Black American families high and dry.\n\nI will continue to work with any and all Americans who want to Make America Great Again by bringing back American jobs, improving our schools, building safer and more prosperous communities and reuniting families through meaningful justice reforms.\n\nWhen I promised to stand for the forgotten men and women of this country—whether they live in Chicago or Charlotte, Detroit or Dubuque, or if they are black or white—I meant it. And that's exactly what I've done.\n\nSo, I ask you to examine my record and consider voting for me to continue to fight for you, as your President, for four more years.
SQUAD GOALS: AOC, Omar Demand Student Debt, Foreclosures, Banning CEO Bonuses in Coronavirus Stimulus\n\nposted by Hannity Staff - 3.25.20\n\nMembers of the 'Squad' demanded a series of far-left proposals be included in the Congressional relief package to help Coronavirus victims this week; asking for the cancellation of student debt, banning of evictions, and prohibition of executive bonuses in the plan.\n\nAny rescue package must:\n\n1) Cancel student debt\n\n2) Fund losses for small businesses and local governments\n\n3) Ban evictions and foreclosures\n\n4) Ban stock buybacks and executive bonuses\n\nWe need a groundswell of support for these critical measures! posted Omar on social media.\n\nThe developments of this Senate relief bill are concerning.

It will rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar.\n\nRead the full report here.\n\nSource: Associated Press
Multiple sources are reporting that Apple Computers is likely to repatriate upwards of $200 billion into the United States following the passage of the GOP tax legislation; citing a key provision that allows international corporations to bring American dollars back to the country at a reduced rate.\n\nApple has been actively preparing to repatriate over $200 billion in overseas cash since 2016. With the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 cutting the repatriation tax rate to 15.5 percent, Apple can now bring all of its foreign profits back to the U.S. at a nearly 20 percent discount, writes VentureBeat.\n\nAccording to CNBC, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that bringing the funds back to the US is what's good for America.\n\nThe issue is not that there's a tax on international earnings. The issue is the existing tax has been crazy, Cook said. No one would bring it back at a 40 percent—I mean, 35 percent federal and then state taxes. That's the problem. I think it's smart for the United States to have some kind of tax revenue for international earnings—if that tax were reasonable.\n\nThe move comes as other American corporations react overwhelmingly positive to the GOP tax cuts. Major companies, such as AT&T, American Airlines, Boeing, and more doled out large holiday bonuses to US-based workers following the passage of the bill.
From Fox News:\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is considering tax hikes to help plug the city's $1.2 billion budget deficit , according to a report.\n\nThe city is weighing a $94 million property tax hike, raising the gas tax and laying off more than 300 workers to help fill the gap, the Chicago Tribune reported.\n\nOther potential cost-saving measures include a five-day furlough for all nonunion city employees, shifting some costs onto the books of the Chicago Public Schools and raising the cloud-computing tax.\n\nLightfoot is set to unveil her plan at a press conference on Wednesday.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused Chicago's gross domestic product to decline by 10% from a year ago, leading to a $799 million mid-year 2020 budget shortfall.\n\nThe economic damage caused by the pandemic was a sharp blow to Chicago's most recent attempt to get its fiscal house in order. Lightfoot last year identified more than $500 million in structural solutions, the most since 2012, to fill the city's record $838 million gap.\n\nChicago has a long way to go even if the budget gap is filled. The city is burdened with $46.5 billion of unpaid bills and has just $10 billion cash, according to a July 2020 report released by Truth in Accounting.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi doubled-down on the Democratic Party's push for a $15 national minimum wage Thursday; saying they will persist despite the measure being defeated in the Senate by a wide margin.\n\nWe will persist with the minimum wage, Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters.\n\nWe're not giving up on that, Pelosi said.\n\nFar-left Senator Bernie Sanders' push to double the minimum wage to $15 an hour hit a major roadblock last Friday when seven Democrats and one Independent voted with the Republicans to block the measure.\n\nSens.

We're going to keep bringing it up, and we're going to get it done because it is what the American people demand and need, posted Sanders on social media.\n\nIf any Senator believes this is the last time they will cast a vote on whether or not to give a raise to 32 million Americans, they are sorely mistaken.

Read the plan: https://t.co/RJDLvX5H4c — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019\n\nIn order to reduce the outrageous level of inequality that exists in America today and to rebuild the disappearing middle class, the time has come for the United States to establish an annual tax on the extreme wealth of the top 0.1 percent of U.S. households, Sanders writes. This wealth tax would only apply to net worth of over $32 million and would raise an estimated $4.35 trillion over the next decade. Anyone who has a net worth of less than $32 million would not see their taxes go up at all under this plan.\n\nThe tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion. These brackets are halved for singles, adds Bernie.\n\nUnder this plan, the wealth of billionaires would be cut in half over 15 years which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small privileged class, he concludes.\n\nRead Sanders full proposal here.

The US is the richest nation on earth and a 2nd stimulus check is getting blocked bc GOP want corporate bailouts & austerity in exchange for it.\n\nIt is unacceptable that the proposal does not even do what the CARES Act did and provide, at the very least, a $1,200 direct payment to working-class Americans and $500 for their kids, Sanders said in a statement last week. Tens of millions of Americans living in desperation today would receive absolutely no financial help from this proposal. That is not acceptable.\n\nFar-left politicians slammed the bipartisan CoVID relief package making its way through the US Senate this week; saying the bill fails to deliver direct payments to working-class Americans and struggling small businesses.\n\nA NEW LOW: AOC 'Absolutely' Agrees with Host Slamming 'Criminal Israeli Government' and 'White Supremacist Jews'\n\nposted by Hannity Staff - 7.31.19\n\nControversial Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez doubled-down on her vitriolic rhetoric regarding the Middle East peace process in a recent interview; saying she absolutely agrees with the host's criticism of the criminal Israeli government and other White Supremacist Jews.\n\nAbsolutely Ocasio-Cortez agrees with host calling Israeli Government criminal white supremacist Jewshttps://t.co/5Mc4uK04AW pic.twitter.com/wWpEjbRs5P — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) July 30, 2019\n\nThere's a lot of young Jewish people that I know that are absolutely against the occupation and I wanted you, because often on this program, we have the freedom to address the fact that something that you know people, it's an oxymoron, how do you have white supremacist Jews? How do you have people like Stephen Miller? How do you have these individuals who are legit aligning with racism and white supremacy, but they're Jewish and it's something that most people can't wrap their brains around. But it's a real thing and what's going on with Israel and Palestine, while it's very deep, it is very, very criminal. It is very, very unjust, said 'EBRO in the morning.'\n\nAbsolutely, and I think to where we're at as a country when it comes to Israel-Palestine is very much a generational thing. I think that when we start looking at it through that lens, a lot of this stuff starts to make sense. It's like what you're talking about, young Jews in Israel are sick of this, said Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nPresident Trump called-out 'The Squad' on social media earlier this month; blasting the four freshman Congresswomen as racist troublemakers and not very smart.\n\nThe 'Squad' is a very Racist group of troublemakers who are young, inexperienced, and not very smart. They are pulling the once great Democrat Party far left, and were against humanitarian aid at the Border…And are now against ICE and Homeland Security. So bad for our Country! posted the President on Twitter.\n\nThe Squad is a very Racist group of troublemakers who are young, inexperienced, and not very smart.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 22, 2019\n\n'The Squad' consists of Representatives Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Tlaib, and Pressley.\n\nRashida Tlaib sounded the alarm on President Trump's tax cuts Monday; pledging to repeal the legislation and give the money back to the people that earned it.\n\nRecently, I introduced the Boost Act. This legislation completely repeals the GOP Tax Scam… Do you know what I did with that money? What I said? We're going to go ahead and put it in the pockets of every day Americans… We give it back to the people that earned it, said Tlaib.
ANOTHER NEW DEAL? Warren Proposes Using US MILITARY to Combat Climate Change\n\nposted by Hannity Staff - 5.20.19\n\nFirebrand Senator and potential 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren unveiled her latest proposal to combat climate change Monday; suggesting the use of the US military to confront global warming.\n\nIn short, climate change is real, it is worsening by the day, and it is undermining our military readiness. And instead of meeting this threat head-on, Washington is ignoring it — and making it worse, writes Warren in an op-ed published by Medium.\n\nWe have the most capable military in the world. It's also the single largest government consumer of energy, and it's dependent on fossil fuels. The Pentagon spends about $4 billion a year to power its bases at fixed locations and consumes tens of billions of barrels of fuel per year, she adds.\n\nNibbling around the edges of the problem is no longer enough — the urgency of the moment demands more. That's why today I am introducing my Defense Climate Resiliency and Readiness Act to harden the U.S. military against the threat posed by climate change, and to leverage its huge energy footprint as part of our climate solution, concludes Warren.\n\nTogether, we can work with our military to fight climate change. https://t.co/fYixnw11bz — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) May 19, 2019\n\nThe far-left Senator's comments come weeks after she unveiled a series of new government programs that economists say will cost US taxpayers trillions per year.\n\nIf we put a 2% tax on the wealthiest families in the country, we can provide universal Pre-K, universal free college, knock back student loan debt for 95% of Americans—and still have a trillion dollars leftover, claimed Warren on social media.\n\nIf we put a 2% tax on the wealthiest families in the country, we can provide universal Pre-K, universal free college, knock back student loan debt for 95% of Americans—and still have a trillion dollars leftover. #WarrenTownHall pic.twitter.com/1MMM1eOghf — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) April 23, 2019\n\nAccording to leading economists, the Senator's proposal to forgive student loan debt and introduce tuition-free public colleges would cost over $1.25 trillion over the next decade.
A new survey published by Fox Business this week shows the negative impact of California's progressive tax scheme on average residents, with nearly 50% of its citizens saying they feel stretched economically.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom is pushing new taxes despite the state's $21 billion surplus — and Californians want to know why, according to the CEO of the Public Policy Institute of California, Mark Baldassare, reports Fox Business.\n\nIn our latest poll we found that almost half of Californians said that they felt they're paying too much in taxes now and that's consistent with what we know from looking across the states in terms of California being one of the… states that has the highest taxes, he told FOX Business' Stuart VarneyOpens a New Window. on Monday.\n\nThe massive tax burden is forcing the state's Middle Class to flee the region by the thousands.\n\nCalifornians are really very stretched economically — many who are in the middle class, said an industry expert. Of course there are many who are doing very well in California but many who aren't doing well– we have the highest poverty rate in the nation as well as tremendous wealth that's accumulated here in this state.\n\nTo make matters even worse, millions of Californians may soon face a series of new taxes on everyday items in the coming months, with lawmakers weighing a series of proposals that could prompt higher prices on water, car batteries, lawyers, prescription painkillers, tires, and more.\n\nBut in California under Democrats, it's tax, tax, tax — a drip and a drop, nickel and a dime — all the time. That's not a political statement. It's a fact. Not all taxes are evil. Some are justified. But many are unwarranted. And others are eye-rollers, reports the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThere are a whole bunch of taxing ideas in the Capitol: on new tires, firearms, water, prescription painkillers, lawyers, car batteries, corporations based on their CEO pay, estates worth more than $3.5 million, oil and gas extraction. The list goes on, adds the author.\n\nThe potential taxes come months after the state government voted to tax drinking water as the region continues to struggle with widespread droughts and forest fires.\n\nRead the full report at Fox Business.
They are now no longer able to elect anyone who represents them… This weaponization is not only intentional, it's continuing, she added.\n\nDemocrat Stacey Abrams: illegal immigrants are now no longer able to elect anyone who represents them https://t.co/kZN81fgNL2 pic.twitter.com/7LK2RsTkNr\n\nIn the United States today, 50% of the population under the age of 15 is communities of color. If you remove them from the calculation then what that means is you create a whiter, more Republican voting base, said Abrams.\n\nPotential Democratic frontrunner for Vice President Stacey Abrams surprised viewers on social media Thursday; lamenting that illegal immigrants are no longer able to elect anyone who represents them.\n\nADD IT TO THE LIST: Hillary Blames Supreme Court Decision for 2016 Election Loss\n\nposted by Hannity Staff - 9.17.19\n\nTwice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton continued her worldwide excuses tour this week; asserting a Supreme Court decision regarding the Voting Rights Act had a major impact in her 2016 loss to Donald Trump.\n\nNow, I was the first person who ran for president in more than 50 years without the protection of the Voting Rights Act. And let me just say, it makes a difference, said Clinton at an event hosted by the American Federation of Teachers.\n\nThe latest remarks were seemingly the first time she alleged a structural disadvantage created by the Supreme Court. In 2013, the Court drew Democrats' ire when it struck down a portion of the Voting Rights Act, which was passed in 1965 as a way to secure voting rights for African Americans, reports Fox News.\n\n.@HillaryClinton: You can get the nomination. You can win the popular vote. And you can lose the Electoral College and therefore the election for these 4 reasons. Number One: Voter suppression.

Voter ID requirements amounted to a modern-day poll tax. Voter ID requirements, which were literally made up for the purpose of preventing certain people from actually being able to cast a vote that would be counted. We saw fewer voting places, long lines, and malfunctioning equipment — again, in certain places.\n\nTo date, Clinton has blamed her 2016 loss on the mainstream media, Facebook, Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, the FBI, James Comey, misogyny, racism, local newspapers, Russia, and more.\n\nRead the full report at Fox News.
A stunning new poll released this week shows nearly half of San Francisco's residents want to leave the city; saying the region's rising costs, soaring crime, and rampant homelessness make the area nearly inhospitable.\n\nAccording to the new data, just 25% of those asked believe San Francisco and its surrounding towns are moving in the right direction, with a staggering 55% saying the area has gone seriously off on the wrong track.\n\nEven worse, a whopping 46% of residents said they agree with the statement I am likely to move out of the Bay Area in the next few years.\n\nThe survey, released by EMC Research, further fuels growing speculation the Bay Area is heading towards an all-out crisis as more and more residents leave the region for other areas of the country.\n\nOver the weekend, Governor Jerry Brown unveiled yet another tax scheme; this time raising prices on the state's drinking water to help finance new infrastructure projects.\n\nRead the poll here.\n\nh/t Sacramento Bee
