Embattled New York Governor threatened to raise the taxes of countless residents across the Big Apple this week; saying all options are on the table despite a massive federal bailout.\n\nTax increases are on the table…because you have damage to repair, Cuomo told reporters during a press briefing on Sunday.\n\nNew York will get about $23.5 billion from the relief bill, which Democrats are passing without any Republican support. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the state government will get about $12.7 billion, while New York City will receive an estimated $6.1 billion. The state's counties will get about $3.9 billion, while $825 million will go to small cities, towns and villages in the state, reports Fox News.\n\nThe robust package, the robust basket of aid that we have been able to put together and pass yesterday, will affect just about every aspect of New York life where there has been trouble, Schumer said.\n\nRead the full report at Fox News.
AMERICA RESPONDS: AOC Describes Coronavirus Relief Vote as 'Literally a Hostage Situation'\n\nposted by Hannity Staff - 3.27.20\n\nCongresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez described Friday's vote on the Coronavirus relief plan as a hostage situation, calling the legislation a gift to America's biggest corporations and wealthiest residents.\n\nEach one of us takes this vote alone. This is not an easy position for anyone to take. It's a tough position, because it's literally a hostage situation, said Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nAOC, who is critical of the stimulus, said this when I asked if she was disappointed by Bernie Sanders' position in support: Each one of us takes this vote alone. This is not an easy position for anyone to take. It's a tough position, because it's literally a hostage situation — Manu Raju (@mkraju) March 27, 2020\n\nOcasio-Cortez doubled-down on her fierce opposition to the Senate's bipartisan Coronavirus relief package Friday; calling the legislation shameful and crumbs for American families.\n\nOur community's reality is this country's future if we don't do anything. Hospital workers do not have protective equipment. We don't have the necessary ventilators. We have to go into this vote eyes wide open, said Rep. Ocasio-Cortez on the House Floor.\n\n.@RepAOC @AOC: Our community's reality is this country's future if we don't do anything. Hospital workers do not have protective equipment.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders took a swipe at liberals and the mainstream media Wednesday night, posting numerous economic success stories on social media while left-leaning users couldn't help but hide their hatred for President Trump and his policies.\n\nSanders posted a series of patriotic tweets touting the President's strong economic record and the blossoming American economy; highlighting recent polls that show two-thirds of Americans think the economy is good or excellent, recent economic gains for working-class families, and the success generated by recent GOP tax cuts.\n\n66% of voters say the economy is good or excellent – the highest since 2001 – according to new Quinnipiac poll. America has turned a corner under the President's strong leadership. — Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) January 11, 2018\n\nLow-income and working-class families are enjoying significant economic gains not experienced in nearly 20 years under policies implemented by the Trump administration https://t.co/VDaSNBIH4s — Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) January 11, 2018\n\nHuge news! Truly amazing and inspiring to witness the tax cuts lifting millions of hardworking Americans up. https://t.co/lHvlcOQw9H — Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) January 11, 2018\n\nLiberal users were quick to dismiss Sanders' comments, either deflecting the good news or outright claiming that President Obama –not Trump- deserves credit for the gigantic economic recovery.\n\nThis is just another lie, I know here in Florida that prices has gone up alone with electric, water, food, car insurance, House insurance, medical, Medicare, and Medicaid. So that 18.00 a pay check does not go very far! Just more BS lies from @PressSec, wrote one user.\n\nAmerica has not turned a corner. They have continued up the path set by Obama under whom the S&P500 tripled and Uunemployment halved, while inflation, interest rate and gas prices bottomed out, and car sales set record levels, said another.\n\nh/t Twitchy
Controversial Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez polled her followers on social media this week over the impending CoVID relief bill making its way through Congress; asking if $600 is enough for out-of-work Americans.\n\n(FYI this is the current proposed COVID package amount – PLEASE CALL YOUR MEMBER if you have any doubt whatsoever on what their stance is) — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) December 16, 2020\n\nAnd if you don't want your member to vote for a $600 deal, you really need to tell them that. Don't think oh I voted for a Dem, we'll be fine. No. If there's an amount that's too little, or any other red line that you want them to vote NO on, then you need to tell them that. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) December 16, 2020\n\nAnd if you don't want your member to vote for a $600 deal, you really need to tell them that.

A new report from the Wall Street Journal is shedding dramatic new light on Elizabeth Warren's economic proposal; saying her recently revealed tax plan could bring rates over 100% for wealthy Americans.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has unveiled sweeping tax proposals that would push federal tax rates on some billionaires and multimillionaires above 100%, writes the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThat prospect raises questions for taxpayers and the broader economy that experts are starting to ponder: Under which circumstances would taxpayers have to pay those rates? How might that change their behavior? And would investment and economic growth suffer? adds the report.\n\nThe rising presidential candidate came under fire earlier this week after she began selling merchandise on her campaign web store branded with the slogan Billionaire Tears.\n\nPresidential candidate Elizabeth Warren isn't backing down from her fight against billionaires — in fact, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts is now selling $25 'billionaire tears' mugs on her campaign website, reports Yahoo News.\n\nIn November 2019, billionaire and former Goldman Sachs executive Leon Cooperman (who as recently as 2017 settled with the SEC on insider-trading charges) was brought to tears on live television while discussing the prospect that a President Elizabeth Warren might require him to pay his fair share in taxes, writes Warren's webstore.\n\nSavor a warm, slightly salty beverage of your choice in this union-made mug as you contemplate all the good a wealth tax could do: universal childcare, student debt cancellation, universal free college, and more, adds the site.\n\nBy popular demand: — Team Warren (@TeamWarren) November 14, 2019\n\nI've paid over $10 billion in taxes, said billionaire Bill Gates when asked to comment on Warren's 'Ultra Wealth' tax. If I had to pay $20 billion, it's fine. But when you say I should pay $100 billion, OK then I'm starting to do a little math about what I have left over. You really want the incentive system to be there, and you can go a long way without threatening that.\n\nRead the full report here.\n\nSource: Wall Street Journal
Vermont Senator and former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders unloaded on the Disney Corporation this week; blasting the iconic brand for dodging a living wage for nearly 30,000 employees.\n\nAccording to the Guardian, the Democratic socialist slammed the 'House of Mouse' Thursday after Disney executives walked away from massive tax breaks and government subsidies for its southern California theme parks; funds that would have required the company to pay $18 an hour to all employees by 2022.\n\nDisney is so nervous that the living wage ballot initiative in Anaheim is going to pass, said Sanders, it would rather end some of the corporate welfare it receives from local taxpayers than pay all 30,000 of its workers decent wages.\n\nDisney released an official statement regarding the government funds hours later; saying the policies have become divisive.\n\nCities around the nation have implemented similar incentive policies with great success. However, unfortunately in Anaheim these policies have become divisive, leading to an unstable business climate and a difficult working relationship with the city.\n\nRead the full report here.
They're under audit, they have been for a long time, they're extremely complex, people wouldn't understand them, Trump said earlier this year. Nobody turns over a return when it's under audit.\n\nBut the legislation is largely symbolic, as it has little chance of actually becoming a law. The Republican-held Senate, which increased its majority after the midterm elections, is unlikely to vote for the bill. Trump himself could also refuse to sign it, writes Fox .\n\nAccording to Fox News , the first piece of legislation -titled H.R. 1- will target the President's personal finances; making it a federal mandate that all presidents fully disclose their income taxes.\n\nThe new Democratic majority's first order of business in the House of Representatives will target President Trump's tax returns in January; setting the stage for a high-stakes legal showdown with the Commander-in-Chief.\n\nJAIL TIME? Democrat Wants Top Trump Officials 'Jailed' Over the President's Tax Returns\n\nposted by Hannity Staff - 5.22.19\n\nAt least one Congressional Democrat is now calling for senior Trump officials to be jailed for refusing to hand-over the President's tax returns; setting the stage for another high-stakes legal showdown with the White House.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett said Tuesday that IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin should be jailed or fined for stonewalling congressional subpoenas for President Trump's tax returns, reports Fox News.\n\nDoggett, D-Texas, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, said Tuesday that congressional Democrats need to employ what's known as 'inherent contempt' for Trump officials defying committee requests and subpoenas for Trump's financial information, adds the article.\n\nI believe that there is no legal advice that will stop the lawlessness and lies of this administration, and that is why Congress needs to act firmly now to use every tool it has available to get this information that Trump so fears that the public will see, Doggett told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Tuesday night.\n\nTo take action, I believe it's going to require fines or confinement under our power of inherent contempt to get the information we need and to get all these other people that, under what seems to be gang rule, are told don't say anything and don't provide anything, he continued. Total silence, total obstruction.\n\nThe Democrat's comments come after top lawmakers voted to hold the Attorney General in 'contempt' for refusing to speak with legislators regarding Robert Mueller's no collusion conclusion.\n\nAttorney General William Barr reportedly met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi face-to-face last Wednesday during an event at the Capitol; asking the top Democrat if she brought her handcuffs after accusing the senior Trump official of breaking the law just days ago.\n\nColleague Jake Gibson rpts AG Barr spoke to Pelosi in person today, after the National Peace Officers Memorial Service at the Capitol. Source says Barr went up to Pelosi & asked her if she brought her handcuffs, reported a journalist from Fox News.\n\nColleague Jake Gibson rpts AG Barr spoke to Pelosi in person today, after the National Peace Officers Memorial Service at the Capitol. Source says Barr went up to Pelosi & asked her if she brought her handcuffs — Chad Pergram (@ChadPergram) May 15, 2019\n\nWhat is deadly serious about it is the attorney general of the United States of America was not telling the truth to the Congress of the United States, Pelosi told reporters earlier this month. That's a crime.\n\nWe will have no choice but to move quickly to hold the attorney general in contempt if he stalls or fails to negotiate in good faith, Mr. Nadler said. But the attorney general must make a choice. Every one of us must make the same choice. That choice is now an obligation of our office.\n\nThe choice is simple: We can stand up to this president in defense of the country and the Constitution we love, or we can let the moment pass us by, he added.
President Trump signed an Executive Order Thursday cancelling student debt for permanently disabled veterans; effectively forgiving loans for more than 25,000 Americans.\n\nThe order, which Trump signed following a speech at the American Veterans National Convention in Louisville, Ky., also clears those eligible veterans from having to pay any federal income tax on the loans. Trump added that he is pressuring individual states to follow suit, reports Fox News.\n\nThe debt of these disabled veterans will be completely erased, Trump said. That's hundreds of millions of dollars of student loans debt for our disabled veterans that will be completely erased.\n\nIt was my honor to sign a Presidential Memorandum facilitating the cancellation of student loan debt for 25K of our most severely disabled Veterans. With today's order, we express the everlasting love & loyalty of a truly grateful Nation. God bless our Vets, & God Bless America! pic.twitter.com/MMMsX3RDQM — Donald J.

With today's order, we express the everlasting love & loyalty of a truly grateful Nation. God bless our Vets, & God Bless America! Trump tweeted.\n\nTrump's announcement comes days after the administration hired a longtime student loan industry executive to be the federal government's top watchdog for the student loan market. Robert Cameron will serve as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's new student loan ombudsman, the bureau said Friday, adds Fox.\n\nRead the full report here.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen signaled this week that the Biden administration could be open to a so-called 'Wealth Tax' on the nation's top earners; imposing a 2% penalty for US households with assets exceeding $50 million each year.\n\nThat's something that we haven't decided yet and can look at, said Yellen.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren's proposal would impact about 100,000 families in the USA and could generate between two and four trillion dollars over the next decade.\n\nSomebody has to pay to make this country run. Somebody has to pay for roads and bridges and scientific research. But the top 0.1% pay a lower share of their wealth in taxes than the bottom 99%. We need a #WealthTax to keep the rich from freeloading off America's middle class. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) March 13, 2021\n\nThe Biden administration is actively exploring other ways to offset the costs of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan and the next economic spending bill. The next initiative — which could cost as much as $4 trillion — won't rely on just government debt as a funding source and could include an increase in both the corporate tax rate and the individual rate for high-income earners, reports Fox News.\n\nRead the full report here.
Firebrand Senator and potential 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren called for the abolishment of the Electoral College Monday night; saying the US needs a constitutional amendment to ensure every vote is counted.\n\nWarren was speaking with supporters at town hall event in Mississippi when she called for the drastic reconfiguration of the century's old American election process.\n\nI believe we need a constitutional amendment that protects the right to vote for every American citizen and makes sure that vote gets counted, said Warren.\n\nEvery vote matters. We need to get rid of the Electoral College so that presidential candidates have to ask every American in every part of the country for their vote, not just those in battleground states. #WarrenTownHall pic.twitter.com/UT3mYHXHQ2 — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) March 19, 2019\n\nWe need to put some federal muscle behind that, and we need to repeal every one of the voter suppression laws that is out there, she added. Every vote matters, and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the Electoral College.\n\nRead the full report here.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren doubled-down on her calls for a series of new proposals and entitlement programs for all Americans this week; bizarrely suggesting a '2% tax on the wealthiest families' can fully fund trillions of dollars in increased spending.\n\nIf we put a 2% tax on the wealthiest families in the country, we can provide universal Pre-K, universal free college, knock back student loan debt for 95% of Americans—and still have a trillion dollars leftover, claimed Warren on social media.\n\nIf we put a 2% tax on the wealthiest families in the country, we can provide universal Pre-K, universal free college, knock back student loan debt for 95% of Americans—and still have a trillion dollars leftover. #WarrenTownHall pic.twitter.com/1MMM1eOghf — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) April 23, 2019\n\nAccording to leading economists, the Senator's proposal to forgive student loan debt and introduce tuition-free public colleges would cost over $1.25 trillion over the next decade.
'THE ANSWER IS NO': Hannity's Reality Check for CNN's Jimmy Acosta\n\nposted by Hannity Staff - 6.19.19\n\nSean Hannity torched CNN's senior White House correspondent Jim Acosta Wednesday; blasting the anti-Trump journalist after he bizarrely challenged the Fox News host to schoolyard meeting.\n\nAs I said to little Fake News Jimmy Acosta, you have not earned time on the number one show in all of cable news. You can tell all your reps to stop begging my staff, the answer is no, said Hannity. Unlike you, I don't peddle lies on the lowest rated cable network in America. Nor will I promote your lies on 618 of the best talk radio stations in America. Nor has anyone ever provided me scripts or talking points (another Acosta lie).\n\nFor the record, I do not recall meeting you on a bus, why did you miss your big chance to talk to me? he asked. Now I do have good news for you. I will gladly meet you privately in a mutually agreeable 'schoolyard' ALONE, as you requested. My only condition is this meeting will have nothing to do with your failing book, failing career, or failing network. I'm free the week of the 4th.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/1139589739504394240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1139589739504394240&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Ftv%2Fhannity-fires-back-at-acosta-hes-been-begging-to-come-on-my-show%2F\n\nAcosta attacked Hannity during a radio interview with Hugh Hewitt; calling Fox News a house organ for the President.\n\n[At] certain hours of the day on Fox…it is very much a house organ for the president, Acosta said. Have we ever witnessed a situation like that, where a network essentially just serves as an amplifier of the president's message of the day? And to some extent, focused and fixated on the conspiracy theories that he spreads. That to me is very much the definition of propaganda and state TV.\n\nThe likes of Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson, they're willing to go off on me on their shows, but they're not willing to have me on in person to defend myself, Acosta added. What's with that? If you're so darn tough, why don't you give me an invitation to come on your show? What I've found over the last few days is that they're not willing to do that. They're willing to shoot spitballs from the sidelines like the class clown, but they're not willing to meet me on the schoolyard. And that's on them.\n\nListen to Acosta's bizarre comments here.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo unloaded on Democratic Senator Tom Udall during a fiery exchange in Congress Friday; slamming the liberal legislator's claims the President's foreign policy may be designed to financially benefit Donald Trump.\n\nGiven that the president refuses to disclose his tax returns, how can you assure the American people that American foreign policy is free of his personal conflicts of interest? Udall asked.\n\nSenator, I find that question bizarre, fired-back the Secretary of State.\n\nI've been incredibly involved in this administration's foreign policy now for 16 months now, and I have seen literally no evidence of what you are scurrilously suggesting, he added. It is an outrageous suggestion.\n\nWatch the fiery exchange above.
Now in paperback with a foreword by President Donald J. Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's memoir shows how one of the most successful public figures of our time has worked to advance conservative values in Washington.\n\n\n\nUnder Mitch McConnell's famously quiet and strategic leadership, Republicans in the Senate have seen win after win—from tax cuts and deregulation to major improvements for veterans, farmers, and our national defense. In 2018, President Donald Trump dubbed McConnell the greatest leader in history—and even his harshest critics on the Left acknowledge his skill.\n\nNow with a new foreword by President Trump and an afterword that details McConnell's friendship with Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, this paperback edition of McConnell's memoir reveals the backdrop of his decision not to fill Scalia's vacant seat until after the 2016 presidential election. Of this decision, New York Times chief Washington correspondent Carl Hulse wrote that McConnell not only preserved a Supreme Court seat, he elected Donald Trump president.\n\nThe years of the McConnell-led Senate have proved that lasting change can only be won by playing the long game. Leading up to the 2020 election, when the system of government our Founding Fathers created will again be threatened by the Left, this book is necessary reading for anyone who wants to avoid repeating the mistakes of our recent past.\n\nOrder your copy here
