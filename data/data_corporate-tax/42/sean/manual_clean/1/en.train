For example, during the 1930s and 1940s eugenics was used as a basis for the and the Ukrainian Genocide. During this time, eugenic principles spread to many countries and disgusting policies were created, such as forced sterilization and marriage prohibition. Eugenic principles are even seen today; in a New York Times interview with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, she claimed the reason for federally permitted abortion was to limit growth in populations that we don't want to many of. Cases like the legality of abortion illustrate the disregard for human life that is an inherent characteristic of a totalitarian regime. Life begins at conception, according to Princeton University, this is when a new human organism is created. This means that, by definition, abortion is ending the life of another individual. Ignoring this fact, every single Democratic candidate supports abortion, most support late-term abortion, and no Democratic candidate is against late-term abortion. A large part of their argument is that the government may not infringe on a woman's right to choose, leaning on the idea that the government must protect their own liberty. This not only clashes with the government's duty of protecting the life of the baby, but it also relies on the government allowing one individual to infringe on the liberty of another.", "augmented": []}

Mr. Milken's work also democratized corporate finance by providing women and minorities access to capital that would have been unavailable to them otherwise. In 1989, at the height of his finance career, Mr. Milken was charged in an indictment alleging that some of his innovative financing mechanisms were in fact criminal schemes. The charges filed against Mr. Milken were truly novel. In fact, one of the lead prosecutors later admitted that Mr. Milken had been charged with numerous technical offenses and regulatory violations that had never before been charged as crimes. Though he initially vowed to fight the charges, Mr. Milken ultimately pled guilty in exchange for prosecutors dropping criminal charges against his younger brother. As a result, Mr. Milken served 2 years in prison in the early 1990s. Since his release, Mr. Milken has dedicated his life to philanthropy, continuing charitable work that he began before his indictment.

{"original": "The boundaries of freedom end where another's freedom begins. The fine line that defines the limits of liberty can be summed up in the expression the right to swing my fist ends where your nose begins. The issue of defining liberty and rights often is the core of many political issues because people often do not understand that rights and liberty are effectively synonymous. For example, the left commonly argues that universal healthcare is a right, but this argument completely forgets what rights are. The Bill of Rights were not rights granted from the government, they were boundaries set to fully restrict the power of government from certain areas. This is why terms like Congress shall make no law are used so often. In the healthcare scenario, the right to healthcare would require the government to provide this right, but the job of government would be to not stop an individual in getting healthcare, not provide it. Further, for the government to provide healthcare they would have to be providing the service of one individual, the doctor, as a right to another individual. The government cannot provide an individual's service without effectively owning that individual's labor, enslaving that individual through the involuntary enforcement of their provision of labor. The free market is built to be voluntary transactions between two parties, government intervention blocks voluntary transactions.

{"original": "benefit the majority by dehumanizing the minority, stripping away their intrinsic human rights. For example, welfare programs are the forced confiscation of an individual's property to be given to someone else. Socialist programs like these are the foundation of totalitarianism; they are seen in practically every authoritarian government. In order for social programs like this to work, there must be the presumption that the government owns the property of the individual. If the government can control an individual's wealth, or property, to any degree, the government owns the wealth. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, for example, pushes a 90% tax on the upper class in order to distribute more wealth to the poor. If a 90% tax is allowed then there is no reason a 100% tax should not be allowed. The income tax, in general, requires the acceptance that the government can increase or decrease the amount of wealth it decides to take from the people. A 1% income tax requires the same argument as a 100% income tax, both are infringements on human rights. It does not matter that the politicians in government are elected; any government for a free people should not be able to confiscate the property of its citizens.", "augmented": []}
