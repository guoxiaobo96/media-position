Democrats Eye Texas District After Decades Of Solid Republican Control\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/AP Drew Angerer/AP\n\nFor the first time in decades, Democrats are energized about their chances to take a longtime-Republican congressional seat in Texas this fall.\n\nSince the 1970s, the 21st Congressional District has been solidly in Republican hands. Incumbent Rep. Lamar Smith has held onto the district, which includes a large portion of Austin, for more than 30 years. But Smith is retiring at the end of this term — and with signs of a possible wave election for Democrats, Smith's exit has sparked hopes on the Democratic side.\n\nThis is the part of the state that was Republican before Republicans were even a major factor in the state, said Sean Theriault, a political science professor at the University of Texas.\n\nIn these midterm elections, Democrats are looking to take back control of the House, which would break the control Republicans have of Congress and the White House. This is a race that doesn't top handicappers' lists — the Cook Political Report rates it as Likely Republican. So if this race were to go blue, it could indicate a very big wave on Election Night.\n\nBut Democrats are scoping out this district, because its political demographics have shifted over the past few elections. President Trump won it by 10 points in the 2016 election, which was was already a shift from 2012 and 2008 when Mitt Romney and John McCain won it by more.\n\nThat gives Democrats a shred of hope that former Army officer Joseph Kopser ($337,000 on hand) could pull off an upset in a wave, David Wasserman, House editor for the Cook Political Report, wrote in an analysis of the 21st District's rating.\n\nA history of partisan gerrymandering in Texas\n\nThese are the kinds of districts that could see an unintended consequence of political gerrymandering. By trying to squeeze out a maximum number of Republican districts by splitting up much of Austin and San Antonio and stretching them out to more solidly Republican areas, it could potentially mean a more competitive race in a big wave year.\n\nIt's the very definition of gerrymandering, Theriault said. By slicing up all those Democrats in San Antonio and Austin, they're able to have lots of Republicans in this area when you think of this as being a pretty progressive Democratic area.\n\nSmith was reelected with at least 60 percent of the vote until 2016 when he dipped below that for the first time. In this election, Democrats see an opportunity to mobilize their base around gerrymandering as a measure that dilutes their votes, contends Jim Henson of The Texas Political Project who has conducted polling on gerrymandering.\n\nBecause of the way that politics have evolved in the state, you know, over the last couple of decades, he said, all of these voting and election-related issues have become more salient and more partisan, particularly for Democrats.\n\nA conservative Republican versus a moderate Democrat\n\nSmith has been a conservative Republican, voting for President Trump's tax plan and taking a hard line on immigration. Smith is also a climate-change skeptic, who serves as chair of the Committee on Science, Space and Technology, which oversees the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nHe straddles this line between the Republican establishment and kind of the new Tea Party Republicans, Theriault said.\n\nThe Republican running to replace Smith would be just as conservative. If Chip Roy wins, he would be a leading conservative in Congress. The former federal prosecutor, who also worked for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, has faced criticism, because he doesn't actually live in the district.\n\nThe Trump factor is a complicated one here, too, as Roy has campaigned carefully so that he is not tied too closely to Trump.\n\nOf course I disagree with the president on certain policies, but I think you've got to look at the overall package and say, 'Is the president leading?' And give the president the room to lead, Roy told KXAN-TV in Austin. And I think a lot of people in Congress, including Sen. Cruz and others, are giving the president the room to step out and lead and drive forward, and we're seeing the benefit of that.\n\nGerrymandering As A Campaign Issue Listen · 3:38 3:38\n\nRoy will face a Democrat who used to be a Republican. Joseph Kopser is president of Grayline Group, a tech analytics firm based in Austin, and an Army veteran who served in Iraq.\n\nHe's a pretty moderate Democrat. He knows how to solve problems, Theriault said. He has a veteran's pedigree, and so he appeals to the voters that he's going to need to attract in order for him to pull out this race.\n\nKopser is hoping to fire up the very same Democrats that Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke hopes will turn out for him in the tight race against Cruz.\n\nI not only share their progressive values of things we've fought so hard for over the years, Kopser told KXAN-TV, but doing that in a way that will allow independents and those orphaned Republicans who are just so estranged by their party today — they don't even recognize the Texas Republicans of today – to be able to say, 'You know what, we want calm out of the chaos.' \n\nDemocrats across the state are also aiming to capitalize on an 84 percent increase in Democratic voter turnout during the Texas primaries earlier this year, according to The Cook Political Report.\n\nThat jump was yet another metric of heightened Democratic enthusiasm and intensity, key elements when partisan wave elections occur, political analyst Charlie Cook wrote. Having said that, some Democrats are overhyping what happened, forgetting that Texas is still Texas, and that for every two Democrats who voted, three Republicans cast ballots.\n\nLess about the candidates, more about political parties\n\nMany voters in this district seem to have their minds made up, even though some don't even know the names of the candidates.\n\nAaron Bird, who was running a trail along the Colorado River in Austin, said he is voting for Democrats up and down the ballot, because he is dissatisfied with Trump and the way he treats women.\n\nI think it all starts with I have two girls and a wife, he said. I think it's just having someone who represents us in a dignified manner.\n\ntoggle caption Ashley Bailey /Here & Now\n\nAnother voter walking the trail, Laura Hubbard, also plans to vote all blue, because she said Democrats align with her values, namely, having people that we can trust and what they say is believable. Honesty, transparency, giving all people a voice.\n\nBut travel southwest of Austin and voters have a different outlook. Cheryl Poulus, for example, said she always votes Republican, and this congressional race is no exception. She's a big Trump supporter, and said she wants to do whatever she can to support his agenda.\n\nI like how he's reaching out to all the different leaders, Poulus said. I love the trade wars. I think that's gonna be OK. I think it's shaking things up a bit, shaking up the status quo, and then actually it will probably come back to be very good in the end.\n\nThis race, like many around the country, isn't necessarily about the candidates, but the parties they represent. That means Kopser's fate could rest on how well O'Rourke does in getting people out to the polls, Theriault said.\n\nThey're cut from a very similar cloth, he said. When you hear them speak, they don't sound like some of these other candidates that are getting the national headlines because of their strident liberal positions, but rather they seem like common-sense, problem-solving Democrats.\n\nTheriault added that the way Republicans redrew the districts in recent years could backfire and actually help Democrats in this election.\n\nThe problem for the Republicans when they do this is if we start talking about a 10-point wave year, he says, all of those districts suddenly become competitive in a way that no one would have thought they would be competitive two years ago.
Justices May Not Disturb Status Quo When It Comes To Sales Tax For Online Purchases\n\nThe last time the Supreme Court considered whether businesses had to collect sales taxes for out-of-state purchases, the court ruled that they did not have to do so. But that was before the Internet. On Tuesday, the court considered the question again.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nIn 1967 and again in 1992, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that companies don't have to collect sales taxes for out-of-state purchases. That was before the Internet revolutionized the economy. This year, the high court decided to revisit the issue. And today, contrary to expectations, a narrow majority of justices signaled they may not be willing to disturb the status quo. NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports.\n\nNINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: The test case comes from South Dakota, which passed a law requiring out-of-state companies, including online companies, to collect sales taxes. Today, state Attorney General Marty Jackley said that allowing online companies to avoid collecting sales taxes costs states billions of dollars in revenue and unfairly harms local small businesses who do have to add those taxes onto their prices.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nMARTY JACKLEY: That small business on Main Street is losing its sale. That's not fair. That's not right, and that should not be constitutionally sanctioned.\n\nTOTENBERG: But George Isaacson, representing Wayfair, countered that reversing the old decisions would force compliance with 12,000 state and local tax rules across the country and would be so expensive it would drive small companies and startups out of business.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nGEORGE ISAACSON: It would really be a wet blanket on the electronic commerce economy.\n\nTOTENBERG: Inside the court chamber, the justices seemed to concede that the court's prior decisions were wrong. But a majority said Congress would be better equipped to deal with the problem. South Dakota's Jackley objected, noting that the states have been trying to get Congress to pass legislation for 26 years, and Congress has turned a blind eye.\n\nJustice Kagan suggested that in failing to address the issue for so long, Congress has in fact made a choice. It likes the status quo. Justice Alito added, do you have any doubt that states that are tottering on the edge of insolvency have a strong incentive to grab everything they can? And Justice Breyer suggested that even if major changes in the law are needed, Congress can craft a better law than the court can.\n\nJustice Kennedy, however, had a blunt assessment. The assumption of many of these questions is that our prior decision is incorrect but that that doesn't make any difference, and I'm suggesting it does. Justice Ginsburg called the old decisions obsolete. As I see it, she said, everybody should have the same tax collection obligation. Justice Gorsuch - why should this court favor a particular business model that relies not on brick and mortar but mail order?\n\nBetting on the outcome of Supreme Court cases is a bad idea. But counting up the votes today, it looked as though the decision in the online tax case will be 5 to 4 with the odds slightly favoring the online companies' tax-free status.\n\nSHAPIRO: And Nina is still here in the studio with us. I want to ask you, Nina, about another case, one that was decided today involving immigration. This could make it harder for the Trump administration to deport a small number of noncitizens.\n\nTOTENBERG: That's right. The court invalidated part of an immigration statute that requires deportation of lawful permanent residents who are convicted of a crime of violence.\n\nSHAPIRO: What were the facts in this case?\n\nTOTENBERG: Well, there was a Filipino immigrant who'd lived here for 25 years. The court's decision today overturned his deportation order for two burglary convictions. Now, the law on deportation defines a crime of violence as one involving actual force or a substantial risk of force. And today's decision follows one written by Justice Antonin Scalia in 2015. It says that the language in this statute is so vague that it invites arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\n\nSHAPIRO: And a lot of people have noted that the deciding vote here was cast by Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, joining with the more liberal justices. Can we draw any conclusions from that?\n\nTOTENBERG: Not really. I suppose you could note that in this case, he's agreeing with not just the court's liberals but with conservative icon Scalia. But he did write separately to say that the Constitution looks unkindly on any law so vague that reasonable people cannot understand it. Still, this is just one vote in one case from a justice who otherwise has a very consistently conservative record. So at least as of now, you really can't draw any conclusion.\n\nSHAPIRO: That's NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. Thanks, Nina.\n\nTOTENBERG: Thanks, Ari.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR.

Michael Cohen Calls Trump A 'Racist' And A 'Con Man' In Scathing Testimony\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 11:49 p.m. ET\n\nDonald Trump apparently blessed the meeting his son held with a Russian delegation to get dirt on opponents in 2016 and welcomed advance word of efforts by WikiLeaks to disrupt the election, his former lawyer told Congress.\n\nThose were only a few of the politically incendiary allegations Michael Cohen made in a landmark hearing before the House oversight committee on Wednesday. But he stopped short of accusing Trump and his campaign of a full-on conspiracy with the Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nCohen did, however, allege that GOP political consultant Roger Stone phoned Trump to tell him that WikiLeaks intended to release a batch of emails that would embarrass the Democratic National Committee.\n\nCohen described being in Trump's office when Stone called to say he had just talked with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange about the release. Stone has denied that, but he too is facing charges of lying to Congress, in a federal case in Washington, D.C.\n\nA lawyer for Assange also denied on Wednesday that he had spoken by phone with Stone.\n\n'I Know What Mr. Trump Is'\n\nRussian intelligence officers stole emails from the Democrats and others as part of a concerted attack on the U.S. election, although it still isn't clear how much Trump and his campaign knew about Russia's efforts or whether the material WikiLeaks obtained had originated from the work of Russia's intelligence services.\n\nCohen was asked whether he believed it was possible that Trump and his family might have been compromised or whether they might have been willing to collude with the Russians.\n\nYes, he said.\n\nCohen also suggested that Donald Trump Jr. may have told his father about the June 2016 meeting he scheduled at Trump Tower following an offer of help from the Russian government — one the president has denied he knew about at the time.\n\nBut Trump knew about everything, Cohen said.\n\nThere was nothing that happened at the Trump Organization ... that did not go through Mr. Trump for his approval and signoff, he said.\n\nA laundry list of alleged wrongdoing\n\nCohen also made a number of other accusations against Trump:\n\nThat Trump paid Cohen, while in office, to cover the costs associated with buying the silence of a woman who said she had had a sexual relationship with Trump years earlier. Trump has acknowledged the payment but denied the underlying allegations about a sexual relationship.\n\nThat Trump's camp encouraged Cohen to lie to Congress and the public about the negotiations the Trump business had carried on with powerful Russians about a potential Trump Tower real estate deal in Moscow. The statement Cohen prepared, he said, was edited by Trump's lawyers. In a statement provided to NPR Wednesday night, Jay Sekulow, one of President Trump's personal attorneys relating to the Justice Department's 2016 Russian election interference investigation, said Today's testimony by Michael Cohen that attorneys for the president edited or changed his statement to Congress to alter the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations is completely false.\n\nCohen said Trump told him to lie about the medical deferments Trump received that excused him from the draft during the Vietnam War. Cohen said Trump had no medical records to back up his claim of a medical deferment but said he wasn't stupid and had no intention of being drafted.\n\nTrump ordered Cohen to find a fake buyer for a portrait of Trump to make it appear that the painting had sold for a lot of money and was therefore valuable; actually, Cohen said, Trump arranged to use money from his foundation to inflate the sale price.\n\nCohen also faulted Trump for remarks that Cohen called racist and for his years as a con man, treating nearly everyone as a sucker and using his political aspirations as an infomercial for himself — not as a way to serve the United States as the holder of its highest office.\n\nRepublicans reject Cohen's claims out of hand\n\nRepublicans and the White House rejected Cohen's allegations before he even made them, pointing out that he has pleaded guilty to federal charges of lying to Congress and has been sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., objected to the proceedings on Wednesday before Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., had even delivered his opening statement, leading to a dispute over whether the hearing could continue.\n\nUltimately, it went ahead.\n\nTrump said on Twitter that Cohen is only trying to get a lighter punishment, having been sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders slammed the House oversight committee for giving Cohen a venue to air public complaints against the president when Cohen is a convicted liar.\n\nSchemes within schemes\n\nCohen's opening statement addressed directly his history of lying — yes, he said, he had lied many times in the past. But, he said, that was when he was in Trump's thrall, and those days are over.\n\nFor those who question my motives for being here today, I understand, he said. I have lied, but I am not a liar. I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man. I have fixed things, but I am no longer your 'fixer,' Mr. Trump.\n\nCohen provided members of Congress with what he said were documents that backed up his testimony, including a check signed by Trump that Cohen said was part of the reimbursement for paying off adult film actress Stormy Daniels.\n\nTrump, Cohen and Allen Weisselberg, the CFO of Trump's company, worked out the arrangement under which Cohen would be repaid the $130,000 he gave Daniels to keep her from talking, Cohen said.\n\nThey agreed on a year's worth of periodic smaller payments that would make it look like Cohen was getting a retainer as Trump's lawyer, he said. Trump signed some of the checks, one of which Cohen gave to the committee. At least one was signed by Trump Jr. and Weisselberg, which Cohen also gave committee members.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., emphasized that the check was drawn on the trust that Trump created to give up control of his business after he was elected. That indicated that he stayed involved, despite his claims, and interacted with Trump Jr. and Weisselberg to make the payments to Cohen.\n\nThat's garden variety financial fraud, Khanna said.\n\nThe payment to another woman, former Playboy model Karen McDougal, was made on behalf of Trump by the publisher of the National Enquirer, American Media Inc., run by Trump's friend David Pecker.\n\nThat arrangement had been used before, Cohen said, although he didn't detail every other instance in which Pecker had helped Trump catch and kill damaging stories, as the practice was called.\n\nAMI reached an agreement with prosecutors in New York City in which it was not charged with a crime because it cooperated with investigators in Cohen's case.\n\nA brand allegedly built on lies\n\nThe chicanery that Cohen described involved nearly every aspect of Trump's public life and career, according to his allegations.\n\nTrump, for example, was in the practice of falsifying the value of his assets so that he would rank higher in listings of wealthy people, Cohen said.\n\nCohen told Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-Mo., about the practices used within the Trump Organization to take the real value of a building and make it appear greater, which would in turn make Trump appear to be richer.\n\nCohen also described Trump telling him to call a reporter for Forbes magazine to argue about his wealth in its ranking one year.\n\nTrump schemed with Cohen to rig online polls in 2014 and 2015 to make it appear voters were supporting him and thus make his political aspirations seem more plausible, the former lawyer said.\n\nTrump's sensitivities, according to Cohen, even allegedly included his grades and SAT scores.\n\nCohen told members of Congress that Trump told him to threaten his former schools with lawsuits if they released records about him to reporters.\n\nHow Many Times?\n\nA spokesman for Fordham University told NPR on Wednesday that the school received an initial phone call from the Trump campaign and a follow-up letter from a Trump attorney reminding us that they would take action against the university if we did, in fact, release Mr. Trump's records.\n\nFordham also said it was a moot point because it was bound by federal law, and that we could/would not reveal/share any records (as we would not reveal any student records) with anyone except Mr. Trump himself, or any recipient he designated, in writing.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, was preoccupied with the release of President Barack Obama's college transcripts.\n\nA contentious hearing\n\nTrump's allies called the hearing a political circus.\n\nThis might be the first time someone convicted of lying to Congress has appeared again so quickly in front of Congress, said the oversight committee's ranking member, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. Certainly it's the first time a convicted perjurer has been brought back to be a star witness.\n\nCohen even reportedly lied about delivering his own son in the hospital, Jordan said.\n\nAnd Cohen didn't lie only to Congress, observed Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn. He also lied on his tax forms for the Internal Revenue Service, transgressions that were part of his guilty plea in a federal case in New York City.\n\nMeadows also invited an official from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Lynne Patton, who was a former Trump employee. She stood up at the hearing. If Trump is a racist as Cohen charged, Meadows asked, why did he hire Patton, a black woman?\n\nCohen asked in response why there aren't there any black executives within the Trump Organization. Rep. Brenda Lawrence, D-Mich., called Meadows' showcasing of Patton insensitive.\n\nRepublicans also said Cummings and Democrats have become so deranged by their animus toward Trump that they were willing to risk his negotiations in Vietnam.\n\nThe president is meeting with the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, but his supporters complained about what they called an inappropriate focus away from those negotiations over nuclear weapons and on Cohen's accounts.\n\nCummings called Cohen's statement too important not to hear, and he said that Americans listening to the hearing should judge for themselves whether they believe him.\n\nNPR reporters Scott Detrow, Carrie Johnson, Ryan Lucas, Tim Mak and Barbara Sprunt contributed to this report.
Trade Matters In 2016; This May Help You Understand Why\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Olivier Douliery/Getty Images Olivier Douliery/Getty Images\n\nThis week, NPR and some member stations will be talking about trade on the campaign trail and in communities around the country.\n\nIn this presidential election cycle, many Americans are casting votes based on their feelings about past trade deals, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, and proposed deals, especially the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nBut for lots of us, understanding trade deals isn't easy because international commerce creates a complex web of winners and losers — all stretched over a nearly $19 trillion U.S. economy with 323 million people. With an issue so big, how can a voter reach good decisions about candidate positions?\n\nThe single most important idea to remember is that in such a large economy, well, it's complicated. Consider this example:\n\nIn February, Carrier Corp. announced it would shut down some manufacturing operations in Indiana and move jobs to Mexico. The U.S. workers are angry, as of course they would be: Their lives are being turned upside down by a cold, corporate decision. How can there be two sides to that story? Carrier provides a slam-dunk example that NAFTA is bad for Americans, right?\n\nBut remember that Carrier is best known for making air conditioners. As recently as 1993, about a third of U.S. homes had no air conditioning. Now, only about 1 in 10 lacks air conditioning. The change largely reflects the plunge in AC prices, thanks to lower production costs. Even a retiree with limited income may be able to afford a foreign-made room air conditioner for as little as $112 at Wal-Mart.\n\nHeat can be deadly for the elderly. Does the pain felt by a laid-off Carrier worker cancel out the relief felt by an 80-year-old Mississippian who finally can afford an air-conditioned bedroom?\n\nWelcome to trade. Let's get started learning.\n\nWhat Americans Think About Trade\n\nPolls generally have reflected bipartisan support for trade over many years. In 2000, Gallup found that most respondents said increasing trade with China would help. And such support held up until the recession, when, as a December 2008 poll showed, Americans became more skeptical about trade.\n\nIn 2010, as the Tea Party rose up, many anti-establishment Republicans started turning against trade. Business-oriented Republicans (think: Chamber of Commerce) were still very much in favor of trade, but the split with older, blue-collar conservatives was widening.\n\nDespite the recession-related dip and Tea Party backlash, trade bounced back in popularity by 2013 and 2014. Clear majorities of Americans said trade was more of an opportunity than a threat to them. In 2015, Pew found Americans continued to support trade in general — and even TPP specifically.\n\nIn January 2016, a Pew poll showed that global trade was not a hot-button issue, at least not when compared with much bigger concerns about economic growth, terrorism and education.\n\nHowever, the most recent Pew polling shows anti-trade sentiments have now surged among Republicans (with 40 percent calling free trade a good thing vs. 52 percent seeing it as a bad thing). Those who support candidate Donald Trump are especially anti-trade (67 percent said it was a bad thing vs. 27 percent a good thing). Even though Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have said they oppose the TPP, most Democrats support trade (60 percent good thing vs. 30 percent bad thing).\n\nOverall, 51 percent of Americans say such trade agreements have been a good thing for this country, while 39 percent believe they've been a bad thing, according to Pew.\n\nWhat Economists Think About Trade In General\n\nA 2012 survey of top economists showed 85 percent say the benefits of free trade are much larger than any effects on employment. Only 5 percent were uncertain. But critics point to data showing trade puts downward pressure on low-skilled factory wages and jobs. They also say the deals have done far too little to protect workers' rights and the environment.\n\nWhat Economists Say About Trade With Mexico\n\nOn NAFTA's 20th anniversary in 2014, economists re-examined the fallout and concluded it was largely a wash — with the U.S. losing some and gaining some. After reviewing that NAFTA research, the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank said: The general consensus in the literature is that NAFTA has not had significant effects on aggregate outcomes in U.S. labor markets.\n\nIn its NAFTA-impact report, the Congressional Research Service also concluded: NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters. The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest.\n\nWhat Economists Say About Trade With China\n\nA recent important study showed that Chinese goods hurt low-skilled Americans. China's immense workforce helps create a lot of wealth in the U.S. (e.g., Apple grew wildly by using China as its manufacturing backshop) but it tends to make low-skilled workers in the U.S. worse off — not just temporarily, but on a sustained basis. Economists also say that low-cost imports from China hold down prices for U.S. consumers.\n\nWhat Pro-Trade Groups Say\n\nU.S. Coalition for TPP: The benefits of trade are clear: better jobs, higher wages, and lower costs for American families.\n\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce: Selling more of our goods and services around the world is a great way to create American jobs, help small businesses, and keep the United States ahead of its global competitors.\n\nWhat Anti-Trade Groups Say\n\nAFL-CIO: For too long, our nation's trade and investment policies have reflected the influence of powerful corporate interests.\n\nPublic Citizen: Regarding TPP, This massive, controversial, pro-corporate 'free trade' agreement ... threatens everything from the safety of our food to the stability of our economy.\n\nWhat Some Studies Say\n\nThe China Shock: China's emergence as a great economic power has induced an epochal shift in patterns of world trade.\n\nThe Economic Effects of the Trans-Pacific Partnership: It is a substantial positive response to slowing world trade growth and rising trade barriers, and a major contribution toward a rules-based global economy.\n\nTTIP Beyond the Beltway: Regarding the proposed U.S.-European trade deal: The average businessperson, worker or consumer is unaware that the agreement is under negotiation, and some are unsure of the distinct roles that the EU and its individual member states play in the process.\n\nWhat Moody's Says About Trump Proposals\n\nTrump calls for a 45 percent tax on all Chinese imports, and a 35 percent tariff on all goods imported from Mexico.\n\nAt the request of the Washington Post, Moody's Analytics recently modeled Trump's trade proposals for Mexico and China. It showed that if Congress were to approve such changes, China and Mexico would fall into recession — and about 4 million U.S. workers would lose their jobs, and another 3 million jobs that otherwise would have been created will be lost.\n\nThe U.S. economy would end up 4.6 percent smaller by 2019 than it otherwise would have been, and unemployment would rise to 9.5 percent. U.S. unemployment currently stands at 5 percent.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\n\n\nChinese imports did hurt a lot of U.S. workers, but most of that may now be in the rearview mirror. That's because so many factory workers already have been replaced, either by low-wage competitors in other countries, or by technology, just as farm laborers were replaced by tractors a century ago. Because of automation, U.S. manufacturers employ less than 9 percent of the U.S. workforce but generate more than 12 percent of GDP.\n\nAs factory jobs continue to melt away, new trade deals, such as the TPP, will focus on non-manufacturing areas — such as intellectual property, pharmaceuticals, agricultural products and services, etc.
Latest Trump Book, Once Again, Makes The Case That He's Incompetent, Narcissistic\n\nA Very Stable Genius Donald J. Trump's Testing of America by Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker Hardcover, 304 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nBook-length critiques of the presidency of Donald Trump keep piling up on American reading tables, so it seems time for a one-volume wrapup on what we have learned so far.\n\nImagine, for a moment, a high-octane courtroom prosecutor summing up for the jury a case built on the vivid testimony of multiple eyewitnesses.\n\nMore than a dozen previous books by close observers and insider-survivors of the Trump administration have provided that testimony. Now come Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig of The Washington Post to make the closing argument with plenty of reporting of their own.\n\nYou could scarcely ask for more capable advocates. Leonnig won a Pulitzer Prize for her reporting on the U.S. Secret Service in 2015, then joined Rucker and others on a team awarded the Pulitzer for stories on Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nTheir new, collaborative account — titled A Very Stable Genius: Donald J. Trump's Testing of America — walks readers step by step through the first 30 months or so of a presidency like no other. They leave little doubt that they and many of their sources regard that presidency as an unmitigated and deepening disaster — a threat to American government as we have known it.\n\nTwo kinds of people went to work for the administration, we are told on the prologue's third page, those who thought Trump was saving the world and those who thought the world needed to be saved from Trump.\n\nRucker and Leonnig's mission is manifest in their title, a sarcastic jab at one of Trump's more memorable moments of self-congratulation. Accused of being either unthinking or unstable, Trump at the time denied being either. He was, he said, a very stable genius. Whether the president meant that with a touch of self-deprecating humor or not, it functions here as the epitome of self-delusion.\n\nTrump stands accused in these pages of gross incompetence, rampant racism, pathological narcissism, indifference to facts and ethics, and a penchant for chaos. There can be no doubt the prosecutors are asking the jury — and the judgment of history — for a verdict of guilty.\n\nCan a president really be this far removed from the reality base that the rest of official Washington takes for granted? Yes, say Rucker and Leonnig — and what is more, his free-form defiance of norms and restraints is the essence of Trump's governance — and of his enduring appeal to his adherents.\n\nOlder readers may recoil from much of this assessment — not only because the behavior described is repellent, but also because its depiction in such relentlessly damning detail is disturbing. People naturally ask: How much of this can be true?\n\nOne example sure to be much discussed is an anecdote from Trump's 2017 trip to Asia, which involved a stopover in Hawaii and a tour of Pearl Harbor. The authors relate how, while en route to the memorial for U.S. service members killed in the Dec. 7, 1941, attack that brought the U.S. into World War II, Trump pulled [Chief of Staff John] Kelly aside for a quick consult.\n\nThe authors then have Trump saying: Hey John, what's this all about? What's this a tour of?\n\nNext we are told: Kelly was momentarily stunned. Trump had heard the phrase 'Pearl Harbor' and appeared to understand that he was visiting the scene of a historic battle, but he did not seem to know much else.\n\nLater on the same page, we have one senior former adviser adding that Trump was at times dangerously uninformed.\n\nKelly formally left the White House at the start of 2019, so is he the senior former adviser being quoted here? Or was the adviser someone who had heard the Pearl Harbor story from Kelly? Or did the Pearl Harbor story come from someone else entirely?\n\nKelly would seem to be the only person who would have firsthand knowledge of the president's question and of Kelly's own reaction. This is only one of several points in the book where the former Marine Corps general seems the likeliest source on one incident or another.\n\nSo if he was the source, why not say so? Perhaps because Kelly spoke to the authors on background or for some other level of attribution.\n\nPrevious books about Trump have also prompted debates about sourcing and attribution. Like Michael Wolff's two efforts at exposés and Bob Woodward's Fear, this account relies on a mélange of on-the-record and off-the-record insiders with varying degrees of proximity to the president.\n\nAt times, this mixed methodology presents real problems. We are told many things that some critics or some in the White House or former officials have told the authors. Without questioning the legitimacy of these quotations, can we rely upon them the same way we would trust direct attributions?\n\nTo the authors' credit, the on-the-record elements are compelling on their own. These include attributed material from former strategist Steve Bannon, former transition chief (and former New Jersey governor) Chris Christie and some of Trump's Manhattan peers, Tom Barrack Jr. and Chris Ruddy.\n\nSomewhat more speculative are the thoughts indirectly attributed to former White House personnel such as Kelly, including Rex Tillerson (his first secretary of state), Jim Mattis (his first secretary of defense) and Don McGahn (his first White House counsel). All the above come off as valiant public servants who strove to be guardrails — to keep the president's rogue instincts in check – until they were fired or resigned.\n\nWe often hear that a particular White House official was surprised or that they felt one way or another. Without a direct quotation, this is either a species of omniscient narrator or an example of reporters protecting their sources. In this work, as in much contemporary reporting, reporters offer a real-time, firsthand narration of events they did not witness personally. We are being given the eyewitness accounts secondhand.\n\nOne such anecdote tells of Trump meeting for the first time with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India.\n\nTrump is quoted saying to Modi at one point: It's not as though you have China right on your border... We are told this prompted Tillerson to cover part of his face with one hand so as to signal something to Modi without Trump seeing it. (For the record, India's 2,500-mile border with China is more than 500 miles longer than the U.S. border with Mexico.)\n\nOn another occasion, we are told, Trump summoned various officials to discuss the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars U.S. companies from paying bribes to foreign governments to secure business contracts. Trump said he wanted that law erased. Told he could not do undo legislation by fiat, Trump reportedly turned to ultra-loyal aide Stephen Miller and said: Steve, draft an executive order to repeal that law.\n\nThose who followed these events in real time may feel as if they are being dragged back through nightmares they would rather forget. At the same time, for those who have not been as focused on the daily and weekly ups and downs, this catalog may come with the force of revelation. For that reason alone, it is highly valuable.\n\nStill, you don't have to be a Trump loyalist to feel the authors have chosen only the incidents and eruptions that cast Trump in the most unfavorable light, a style reminiscent of the muckraking journalists of a century ago. Those who wish to see Trump's offenses balanced against his tax-and-regulation cuts or hear encomiums to his transformation of the federal judiciary will need to look elsewhere.\n\nAs excerpts of the book appear in the Post, we can expect a blizzard of blowback from Trump. In fact, even before publication, he had begun tweeting insults to inoculate his followers against any infection from Rucker and Leonnig's labors — calling Rucker Mr. Off-the-Record and suggesting that the Post's nasty White House bureau chief should not be allowed back on the grounds.\n\nWhen Trump sent those tweets, the Post immediately rejected criticism. It stood behind its reporters just as it did in the Watergate era, when the team of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein sparked the larger, official investigations that would drive President Richard Nixon from office. Their work relied substantially on unnamed sources, including one in particular (Deep Throat) who turned out to be the deputy director of the FBI.\n\nWe have long relied on front-line reporters from the most prominent news organizations to write books about the powerful figures they once covered. Such books have always trafficked in insider knowledge and insights gleaned from hours spent close to the flame of political power.\n\nYet there is something unsettling about the evolution of this genre. Is it purely a matter of Trump's excesses or has he occasioned a sea change in journalism as well? Is it all about Trump, or are we also witnessing a new set of standards for the presentation of a presidency — or of politics in general?\n\nIn terms of the Trump timeline, this book wraps up around the time the Mueller report on Russian interference in the 2016 election is being debated. Although special counsel Robert Mueller concludes the Russians did interfere in 2016 in hopes of helping Trump, his report does not find a criminal conspiracy involving the Trump campaign itself. But Mueller also provided a list of occasions when Trump's actions could be seen as interfering with the investigation, adding that he could neither indict a sitting president nor say these actions were not indictable.\n\nNonetheless, with Attorney General William Barr and Republicans in general treating the report as an exoneration, the authors tell us, Trump felt liberated. As one former official of his administration tells them: There's a new ethos: This is a presidency of one. It's Trump unleashed, unchanged, unhinged.\n\nIn their final pages, the authors draw a clear line from that moment to the one when Trump makes the moves regarding aid to Ukraine and his desired investigation of prospective rival Joe Biden — the line that led on to Trump's impeachment.\n\nWhatever may happen to that impeachment effort in the weeks and months ahead, it creates a moment of intermission in the Trump saga and a chance to consider how the landscape has already been altered by this president. A Very Stable Genius offers a harrowing companion narrative to be read during intermission.
Federal Judge Delays Manafort Trial, Grants Immunity To 5 Witnesses\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sketch by Art Lien Sketch by Art Lien\n\nUpdate 4:21 p.m. ET\n\nA federal judge in Virginia agreed on Monday to postpone the trial of Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.\n\nThe initial phase of jury selection is still set to get underway this week in Alexandria, just outside Washington, D.C., but Manafort's trial itself now isn't scheduled to begin until next week, on July 31.\n\nFederal Judge T.S. Ellis III told the parties in a hearing that he recognized the equities and good reasons on both sides of this motion and would agree to Manafort's lawyers' request for more time.\n\nEllis also unsealed the names of five witnesses who have been granted partial immunity from prosecution in exchange for their testimony in Manafort's case.\n\nDocuments in the case so far didn't give much suggestion as to what the witnesses might be called upon to tell the jury.\n\nJustice Department special counsel Robert Mueller has charged Manafort with alleged tax fraud and money laundering connected to the work he once did for clients in Ukraine.\n\nManafort is also facing a separate federal prosecution in Washington; his trial there is set to take place later this year.\n\nGovernment witnesses\n\nEllis also ordered the government on Monday to turn over its full list of approximately 30 witnesses by the end of the day. And when asked about amending the proposed written questionnaire for prospective jurors, he said: I'm not moved.\n\nWe're not going to get into how people voted ... of course people can be fair no matter who they voted for, Ellis said.\n\nThe judge said he intended to get a jury seated expeditiously and then keep the process moving once it had begun following the new start date.\n\nI'm not going let this trial drag on, he said. I'm not in the theater business.
Football Taught Jack Kemp Early Lessons In Equality\n\nFormer Buffalo Bills quarterback turned political leader Jack Kemp died over the weekend. He was 73. Many people probably remember him because he was such a popular figure on the talk show circuit, both while he was in office and after he left. And because he was such an eager advocate for whatever he believed in — sometimes too eager — interviewing him was a challenge because it was hard to get a word in edgewise, even a question.\n\nWhat he believed in most was so-called supply-side economics, the tax-cutting philosophy that is most closely associated with conservative Republicans like Ronald Reagan. But what he also believed in was equal opportunity.\n\nCan I just tell you? Of all the people I have ever met, let alone public figures I have ever met, he might be one of the few I can think of as colorblind. And I mean that in a good way. Not blind in the sense of a convenient indifference to other people's real-life circumstances, but a real lack of interest in race — or class or status, for that matter — as a determining factor in his opinions about people.\n\nAs many people know, after his football-playing days ended, Kemp served as a member of Congress for nine terms, representing western New York. He was often quoted as saying his football career served him well as preparation for his later and longer career in politics because, according to a version quoted by The Associated Press, by the time he got into office he had been booed, cheered, cut, sold, traded and hung in effigy.\n\nBut football was good preparation in other ways, because Kemp clearly saw — in a way many of his white peers somehow did not — how ridiculous and destructive racism was for people who were trying to reach a common goal.\n\nIn a letter to his grandchildren that he posted on his company Web site shortly after the election of Barack Obama in November, Kemp talked about how, as a quarterback for the old San Diego Chargers, playing for the AFL championship in Houston, his father sat on the 50-yard line, while his co-captain's father, who was black, had to sit in a small roped-off section of the end zone.\n\nHe reminded his 17 grandchildren of the indignities, small and large, that he saw his teammates and friends endure. But he also went on to say, I could go on and on ... but just imagine in the face of all these indignities and deprivations, Dr. Martin Luther King could say 44 years ago, 'I have an abiding faith in America and an audacious faith in mankind.' \n\nAnd Kemp went on to say, Real leadership is not just seeing the realities of what we are temporarily faced with, but seeing the possibilities and potential that can be realized by lifting up people's vision of what they can be.\n\nKemp will be missed for many reasons, not least because he demonstrated that conservative principles can be argued without the subtext of race-baiting and nativism, to which so many of his peers continue to resort when their electoral backs are against the wall. In fact, it strikes me that the Republican Party, of which Kemp was a committed member, and the traditional civil rights leadership, of which he was often an ally, face a similar quandary of maintaining relevance in a fast-changing country.\n\nThe Republicans, their African-American party chairman notwithstanding, need to determine whether they will stand on ideas — and which ones — or resort to old tactics and tropes. The civil rights leadership, having been denied the respect and appreciation most deserved in their prime, sometimes seems to the younger generation overpraised and accorded excessive deference now, to the point where some younger leaders fear they will never be free of these elders' assumptions and expectations.\n\nKemp's words to his grandchildren are instructive here, too. He said, My advice for you, too, is to understand that unity for our nation doesn't require uniformity or unanimity. It does require putting the good of our people ahead of what's good for mere political or personal advantage.\n\nWorth remembering, as we remember Jack Kemp.
Workers Are Moving First, Asking Questions Later. What Happens When Offices Reopen?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Thomas Barwick/Getty Images Thomas Barwick/Getty Images\n\nKate Ray and her husband, David, had just moved into a one-bedroom apartment in downtown Denver last March.\n\nIt was brilliant for about two days, she recalls. The high-rise building offered floor-to-ceiling windows, a gorgeous roof deck and an outdoor pool.\n\nThen the pandemic arrived, and their jobs went remote. The pool closed within like 48 hours of us moving in, says Ray, 34. The gym closed. All of the amenities closed.\n\nIn November, sewage water started flowing into their apartment from the unit above. That made life even more unpleasant, but it had an upside: They were allowed to break their lease.\n\nWith the freedom to move, they quickly bought a house — sight unseen — just outside Duluth, Minn., where Ray, who was now pregnant, has family.\n\nThey told their employers at first the move was temporary – just through her maternity leave. They didn't mention that they had bought a home in Minnesota.\n\nI think we both had fear of what that would mean for our employment conditions, she explains, but also because we couldn't really admit to ourselves, I think, the level of commitment that we were making and the level of crazy life changes that were happening.\n\nNot everybody is going to come back\n\nThey're not alone in making big moves during the pandemic. With millions of Americans suddenly working remotely, some took the unprecedented opportunity to shift their lives in a new direction — crossing their fingers that when it's safe to go back to the office, they won't have to.\n\nDavid Lewis is the CEO of OperationsInc, an HR consulting firm in Connecticut. Many of his clients have seen employees suddenly move out of state, and they've just rolled with it.\n\nIt wasn't frowned upon as much as it probably would have been prior to COVID — and now I think that day of reckoning is coming, he says.\n\nHe predicts that more than half of companies that can allow remote work will continue to, at least part time. And companies should think hard before being heavy-handed in ordering people back to the office from wherever they are now, he says. The good news is you could get everybody back in the office, he says. The bad news is ... not everybody is going to come back.\n\nWhen it comes to those workers who have already moved, Lewis says it depends who those workers are.\n\nIf they're valued employees and they're productive ones, and they have continued to be productive while working in this COVID world, chances are organizations are going to allow them to continue to do that.\n\nThat seems to be the case for the Rays. Now that they're hundreds of miles from Denver, their employers have hinted that they can probably keep working remotely.\n\nHoping to be fully remote forever\n\nIn Chicago, Renee, 38, was feeling similarly stuck in her high-rise condo when the pandemic arrived. She asked to go by her middle name so that she doesn't complicate her employment status.\n\nHer job at a market research firm went remote, and most of her boyfriend's dog-walking clients no longer needed him. For months, the couple would only leave their River North condo for a 6 a.m. walk.\n\nRenee had long dreamed of moving to Seattle. As the pandemic dragged on, she sought approval from her employer to relocate temporarily to Washington state. After initial pushback, she ended up with a new manager who had no problem with her moving.\n\nSo after holding a Zoom wedding in October, the newlyweds packed up some belongings and their cat, Bagel, and headed to Seattle.\n\nThey're now staying in a series of monthlong rentals.\n\nRenee has not missed the Chicago winter, and she loves having easier access to nature. In Seattle, you have all of these beautiful parks, she says. You can drive into the mountains in 30 minutes and get these amazing hikes in.\n\nThere are tradeoffs. One upside: Washington doesn't have a state income tax. A downside: The couple now pays double for housing, since they still have the mortgage on their Chicago condo. They're not ready to sell that yet, in part because she doesn't know if or when she'll have to return to the office.\n\nShe knows a lot of her colleagues want to be back in the office at least part time. But for her, the goal is to be fully remote forever.\n\nFor employers, moves bring costs and benefits\n\nA PwC survey of 1,200 U.S. office workers currently working remotely found that when the pandemic recedes, 29% want to work remotely five days a week. And 55% said they'd like to be remote at least three days a week.\n\nCompany leaders are a bit less enthusiastic. A parallel survey of executives found that 68% believe workers should be in the office at least three days a week to maintain company culture, and 65% believe the office is very important to increasing employee productivity.\n\nBhushan Sethi leads PwC's workforce strategy practice. He says that whether companies allow significant remote work will depend on what industry they're in, the size of their real estate footprint, and whether they have a lot of young workers to train.\n\nBut there are some big potential upsides for employers to remote work. Companies can hire talent in places they couldn't before, Sethi says.\n\nAnd offering remote jobs can mean gaining — or losing — an edge in attracting and retaining talent. Lewis predicts a big bump in the number of job listings touting that a position can be at least partly remote.\n\nJumping off of a ledge without a parachute\n\nWhile some workers have moved across the country, others have relocated within the very-long-commute range.\n\nOne of them is Benji, 34, who moved with his partner and daughter from downtown Detroit to Lansing, Mich., in August. He asked that his last name not be used in order to not complicate his job situation.\n\nHe and his partner signed a two-year lease, even though Benji's employer, a large health insurance company, hasn't given him permission to work remotely permanently.\n\nOh, it felt totally risky, he says, laughing. It felt like I was jumping off of a ledge without a parachute.\n\nIn Lansing, he enjoys the proximity to his family, a cheaper cost of living and the local schools for his daughter. When there's not a deadly virus, it is a fun town, he says.\n\nHe takes inspiration from the digital nomads he follows on YouTube and travel blogs. They seem to enjoy a sense of freedom and possibility in their lives that he hadn't been feeling in his own work life, he says.\n\nThey're living in Bali and working on a laptop with a hot spot in their bikini — and I was honestly jealous, he says. Moving from Detroit to Lansing is about the closest I was going to get to that kind of jet-setting lifestyle.
After Decades-Long Push, It's Not Clear Who Will Bid In Arctic Refuge Oil Lease Sale\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Barcroft Media/Barcroft Media via Getty Images Barcroft Media/Barcroft Media via Getty Images\n\nJust two weeks before President-elect Joe Biden takes office, the Trump administration is trying to lock-in oil and gas drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge with a hastily scheduled and controversial lease sale.\n\nThe event, January 6, marks a major moment in a 40-year fight over whether to develop the northernmost slice of the refuge's coastal plain, home to migrating caribou, birds and polar bears.\n\nBiden, as well as his pick for Interior Secretary — Rep. Deb Haaland — oppose drilling in the refuge. The hand-off of drilling rights to the highest bidders could make it more difficult to reverse course.\n\nBut despite the high stakes, uncertainty looms over how much oil is actually trapped under the million acres of tundra up for leasing, and how much industry interest there is to go find it.\n\n'We don't know very much about this area'\n\nThe data on what's under the coastal plain is decades old.\n\nWe don't know very much about this area, says David Houseknecht, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. Oil seeps and rock formations seem promising, but he says the agency hasn't estimated the coastal plain's oil potential since the late 1990s.\n\nBack then, it relied on seismic testing from a decade prior, technology that's now outdated. It found that anywhere from about 4 to 12 billion barrels of recoverable oil could lie beneath the federal lands. That's a whole lot of oil, but also a very large range of uncertainty, Houseknecht says. The seismic data that we have are quite old, low resolution and a sparse grid.\n\nThe other challenge, he says: There's no data from actual wells in the refuge.\n\nJust one exploratory well has been drilled in the coastal plain, on Alaska Native land in the 1980s, and the results are a closely-guarded secret.\n\nMark Myers, a former commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, is among only a few people who have seen the well results outside of the oil companies that paid for it.\n\nI signed a confidentiality agreement, and it didn't have an end date on it, he says with a small laugh. I can't comment on it, in terms of what I saw.\n\nA New York Times investigation based on interviews and legal documents suggested the results were not promising.\n\nHouseknecht says geologists don't know more about the coastal plain's oil potential because it wasn't until late 2017 that Congress decided to allow drilling there, after decades of debate.\n\nIn recent years, he says, USGS had the 1980s seismic data commercially reanalyzed and planned to use it for a new oil assessment. But after the opening of the refuge three years ago the Interior Department called off the work without providing a reason why.\n\nBidding could be fairly lukewarm\n\nAs for who will bid in the lease sale, that's another mystery.\n\nOil and gas companies aren't talking about their plans publicly, which isn't surprising, says Kara Moriarty, head of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, an industry trade group.\n\nParticipation in lease sales is one of the most competitive and secretive things between companies, she says.\n\nBidding has already taken place, but Moriarty says she doesn't expect to know more until the federal government unseals companies' bids during the January 6 event, which will be streamed online.\n\nOil industry analyst Rowena Gunn, with the research firm Wood Mackenzie, believes enthusiasm could be fairly lukewarm.\n\nControversy is one reason.\n\nIt wouldn't necessarily be good PR for them to be seen as drilling in the Arctic, or drilling in environmentally-sensitive areas, she says.\n\nEnvironmental organizations and some tribal groups have been lobbying oil companies, banks and other financial institutions to stay away from developing the refuge. A number of major banks say they won't fund oil projects in the Arctic.\n\nOpponents have also filed multiple lawsuits seeking to block drilling. They've raised concerns about its impacts on Indigenous people, the global climate, and wildlife, including the caribou that give birth in the coastal plain and the polar bears that den there. Even if leases are sold, legal experts say it's possible that courts could later cancel them.\n\nIn response to concerns about wildlife, as well as oil industry interest, the Bureau of Land Management recently removed nearly a third of the original 1.6 million acres from the sale. Geologist Houseknect says those areas do not have high potential for oil.\n\n'Very little capital for exploration'\n\nSupporters of drilling the refuge, including many Alaska politicians, argue that it's good for the economy and jobs.\n\nRepublican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski worked with the White House to open the coastal plain to drilling as part of Trump's massive 2017 tax bill. The idea was to create revenue to offset tax cuts, so the legislation directed the federal government to carry out two oil and gas lease sales by 2024.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates the leasing program could generate a windfall of $1.8 billion over a decade, to be split between Alaska and the federal government.\n\nCritics of the sale, including the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, say they expect the dollar-figure to be much lower.\n\nFor right now, this absolutely seems to make no fiscal sense, says Autumn Hanna, vice president of the group. We don't need the oil. Why would we be going into such hard-to-access, sensitive places where the costs of exploration and development are so high?\n\nMyers, the former Alaska commissioner, agrees development costs could dampen interest.\n\nIt's already more expensive to drill in the Arctic compared to, say, Texas. On top of that, he says, oil prices are still relatively low after an oil-price war and the coronavirus pandemic hit the industry hard.\n\nThe prices have fallen down to a level that leaves very little capital for exploration in these companies, Myers says. So that's one of the biggest negatives.\n\nBut perhaps the greatest uncertainty is the changing administration.\n\nPresident-elect Biden says he opposes drilling in the refuge, and that he'll take steps to permanently protect it, though he hasn't said how.\n\nIt's possible his administration could delay the environmental permitting process for companies that buy leases from the Trump administration. Or a Biden administration could try to buy the leases back.\n\nCiting concerns about limited industry interest, Alaska politicians have lobbied for the state to step in. The board of a state-owned economic development corporation recently voted to bid up to $20 million at the lease sale.\n\nThe idea is the corporation could operate as a backstop, to submit minimum bids on the tracts and secure drilling rights in case no one else makes any offers. Then, at some point, it could partner with oil companies to do the actual drilling.\n\nIf any leases are bought and finalized, it will be just the start of a long process. Industry analysts say it would take at least a decade to actually pump oil out of Alaska's Arctic refuge.
White House Wants To Send Checks To Americans As Coronavirus Stalls Economy\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nUpdated at 2:30 p.m. ET\n\nPresident Trump has proposed sending money directly to Americans to help blunt the economic impact caused by the coronavirus pandemic, saying it's time to go big to boost the now-stalled economy.\n\nTrump said he wants Congress to push through a major comprehensive package to help businesses and workers facing hardships — one of many abrupt shifts the administration has made this week as the scope of the pandemic has come into sharp focus.\n\nThat's the way I want to go. I just want to get it done and have a big infusion, as opposed to going through little meetings every couple of days, Trump said. We want to go big.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the administration is asking Congress for another coronavirus relief package — including loans and direct payments — that would inject $1 trillion into the economy. It's a big number, he acknowledged. 'This is a very unique situation in this economy.\n\nAfter weeks downplaying the risk of the virus and dismissing the suggestion that the U.S. economy was headed toward a dramatic slowdown, Trump has made a turn this week, taking on a more somber and ominous tone about the impact the pandemic will have.\n\nPressed by reporters, Trump brushed off suggestions that he had changed his tone. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic, Trump said.\n\nBut before this week, Trump repeatedly compared the coronavirus to the average flu. And in early March, Trump said he did not think it was inevitable that the coronavirus would spread across the country, contradicting health officials at the time.\n\nSending out money immediately\n\nMnuchin met with lawmakers Tuesday to discuss details of the administration's proposal. He said Trump wants to start sending out checks within the next two weeks, though it was not immediately clear whether that would be possible or how it would work.\n\nIt's not clear what income ceiling might be put on the stimulus payments, but Mnuchin said the government does not want to send checks to millionaires.\n\nThe administration is also planning to allow Americans to defer tax payments up to $1 million for 90 days.\n\nMnuchin emphasized that banks and markets would remain open and that Americans would be able to access their money and stocks. We may get to a point where we shorten the hours if that's something they need to do, he said.\n\nWe'll see what happens after that\n\nOn Monday, the White House recommended new guidelines to slow the spread of the coronavirus over the next 15 days, urging older Americans to stay home. Trump asked all residents to avoid crowds of more than 10 people, avoid travel and stop eating in restaurants.\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of state and local officials are issuing sweeping orders to close school for millions of children and shut down bars and restaurants for all but takeout orders. Areas hit hard by the spread of the virus, like San Francisco, have gone further, mandating that residents stay indoors and work from home.\n\nTrump ruled out the idea of a nationwide lockdown at this time but did not rule out taking even stricter measures as the pandemic continues.\n\nDeborah Birx, the White House response coordinator, urged people of all ages to heed the guidelines. We hear every night of people who are not in work moving that time into bars and other areas of large gatherings. If we continue with that process, we will fail in containing this virus, she said.\n\nWe're asking the younger generations to stop going out in public places, to bars and restaurants, and spreading asymptomatic virus onto countertops and knobs and grocery stores and grocery carts, she said.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, the coronavirus pandemic has infected more than 195,000 people around the world. In the U.S., there have so far been more than 5,700 confirmed cases.\n\nWith federal officials this week ramping up testing nationwide, public health experts say the prevalence of the virus in the U.S. is expected to get worse before it gets better, since testing in the country has until now been sparse.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that it would still be several weeks or longer before health experts can assess whether social distancing measures are slowing down the spread of the virus. Fauci has been helping lead the administration's response to the virus.\n\nIn Congress, late Monday, the House sent a bill to address paid sick leave and testing to the Senate, which is expected to vote on the measure this week. Earlier this month, Congress passed a roughly $8 billion package to address the response effort.\n\nAdditionally, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer proposed $750 billion to raise funding for unemployment insurance, coronavirus treatment and emergency child care assistance. This spending measure is separate from the aid the White House is seeking from Congress.\n\nNPR's Kelsey Snell contributed to this story.
Restore PA and Wolf's fifth severance tax attempt, explained\n\nEd Mahon/PA Post Bio Recent Stories Ed Mahon was a reporter for PA Post.\n\n\n\nPreviously, he was an investigative and political reporter at the York Daily Record/Sunday News, where his work revealed holes in Pennsylvania's system for protecting victims of domestic violence.\n\n\n\nHe grew up in Delaware County, graduated from La Salle University in Philadelphia and has lived in Pennsylvania most of his life.\n\nMarie Cusick Bio Recent Stories As the Harrisburg reporter for StateImpact Pennsylvania, Marie Cusick covers energy and environmental issues for public radio stations statewide. She's also part of NPR's energy and environment team, which coordinates coverage between the network and select member station reporters around the country. Her work frequently airs on NPR shows including Morning Edition, All Things Considered, and Weekend Edition. Since 2012, Marie has closely followed the political, social, environmental, and economic effects of Pennsylvania's natural gas boom. Her work has been recognized at the regional and national levels– honors include a Sigma Delta Chi Award from the Society of Professional Journalists and a national Edward R. Murrow Award from the Radio Television Digital News Association. Previously, Marie was a multimedia reporter for WMHT in Albany, New York and covered technology for the station's statewide public affairs TV show, New York NOW. In 2018, she became StateImpact's first FAA-licensed drone pilot.\n\nWhen Tom Wolf first ran for governor in 2014, he called for a severance tax on natural gas drilling. After he was elected, he pushed for one in every budget — without success.\n\nThis year, he's trying a new tactic. He's proposing $4.5 billion worth of infrastructure initiatives over four years.\n\nThe state would borrow the money for projects and pay the debt back over a long time — up to 20 years.\n\nUnlike in past years, this severance tax plan is separate from the budget process.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the proposal and why Wolf thinks — this time — it won't be pushed off into never-never land.\n\nWhy the new approach?\n\nDuring a recent interview on WITF's Smart Talk radio show, Wolf said the new approach addresses concerns that the severance tax money would be folded into the general fund and lead to a ratchet up of spending that government has a reputation for doing.\n\nJoanne Cassaro / WITF\n\nHow high would the tax be?\n\nThe rate of the severance tax would vary based on the average annual price of natural gas.\n\nIt could be as low as 9.1 cents per thousand cubic feet of natural gas extracted and as high as 15.7 cents per thousand cubic feet.\n\nThe Wolf administration has estimated that the effective rate of the severance tax would be about 4.5 percent in the first four years. And combined with the existing impact fee, the effective rate would equal about 5.9 percent.\n\nHow much would it cost to borrow the money?\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Turzai, an Allegheny County Republican who opposes Wolf's proposed severance tax, said the plan will likely lead to at least $6.5 billion of new debt because of interest payments required to borrow the money.\n\nDuring a statewide radio interview hosted by Keystone Crossroads, Wolf said he didn't have an exact figure for how much the interest would cost.\n\nWhere would the Restore PA money go?\n\nThe Wolf administration has broken the funding down into main areas.\n\nThey are:\n\nMitigate flooding;\n\nExpand broadband;\n\nAddress blight;\n\nRemove polluting or poisonous substances from schools, drinking water and other places;\n\nGreen infrastructure;\n\nTransportation projects;\n\nBusiness development, including for the last few miles of natural gas utility lines that connect to manufacturing and industrial sites.\n\nWolf says how the money is used will depend on the needs of each community.\n\nBut Wolf said it's worth borrowing the money, and thus paying the interest costs, because of the benefits.\n\nThe question is how much are we going to pay for not preventing floods? Wolf said. …What's the opportunity cost for not having kids who have access to the internet?\n\nWhy the Republican House Speaker doesn't like Restore PA\n\nTurzai has raised several objections.\n\nAssociated Press / Matt Rourke\n\nHere are some of his arguments.\n\nThe tax would make natural gas more expensive to produce and deter fracking in Pennsylvania. The industry has created tens of thousands of jobs and led to savings for residential customers who buy natural gas, Turzai said. The debt is a problem. Turzai said the plan would create a debt-financed slush fund to be allocated at the whim of a new government board. Spending money on infrastructure, rural broadband, stormwater management and brownfield cleanup are worthy projects. But he said, when it comes to broadband, we do take issue with subsidizing multi-billion-dollar corporations to deploy technology using money from taxpayers.\n\nWhat are Republican proposing?\n\nIn the state Senate, two Republicans from southwestern Pennsylvania have proposed what they call an alternative way of paying for important infrastructure projects:\n\nOpening up more gas drilling underneath state-owned forest land.\n\nThis is in no way putting a drilling rig in the middle of a forest, said Republican Camera Bartolotta in a story reported by WITF's Katie Meyer. Three miles away, these things can be done. And it's 6,000 feet underground.\n\nWolf opposes the measure from Bartolotta and Republican Pat Stefano. In 2014, then-Governor Tom Corbett, a Republican, advanced a similar idea, which his administration called non-impact drilling. It was controversial and ultimately did not result in any new leasing or revenue to the state.\n\nMarie Cusick / StateImpact Pennsylvania\n\nIn the House, Turzai and other Republicans have proposed Energize PA — what they call a package of pro-growth, pro-jobs legislation that will raise money by growing the economy.\n\nWolf said Energize PA wouldn't raise the $4.5 billion dollars that his plan would.\n\nWhy some environmentalists don't like Restore PA\n\nThey don't like natural gas drilling.\n\nAnd because Restore PA requires the state to pay off debt with severance tax money, the state would be tied to natural gas drilling for up to 20 years.\n\n#askgovwolf States around us ban fracking, but you have it as a part of your restore PA plan. Why can't we move toward clean renewable energy instead of living in the past? — Fossil Free Pitt (@FossilFreePitt) June 20, 2019\n\n#AskGovWolf Gov. you are way too soft on plastic … SUP is bad, whether it can be recycled or not. Recycling is not the answer. And lightweight products to meet the climate crisis is a euphemism for plastic. We can't bet our future on this toxic industry. — catherine gammon (@nonabiding) June 20, 2019\n\n\n\nIn an #AskGovWolf radio show hosted by Keystone Crossroads, Wolf said people need to be concerned about climate change.\n\nBut in that energy efficient future, in that future that has a lower carbon footprint, we're going to need to have lightweight products and those lightweight products are going to be made of the natural resource that happens to lie beneath Pennsylvania, he said.\n\nLater, Wolf's press secretary, J.J. Abbott, said the governor was pointing to the fact that lightweight plastics improve gas mileage in vehicles and can reduce the energy required for shipping.\n\nWolf's rhetoric around addressing climate change is at odds with his desire to expand Pennsylvania's petrochemical industry. During his reelection campaign last year, Wolf linked the need for renewable energy to his support for the massive ethane cracker Shell is building outside Pittsburgh. Once it's online, the plant will be among the largest air pollution sources in the state.\n\nWhat is Wolf's argument for the severance tax?\n\nPennsylvania is the only major gas-producing state in the country without a severance tax.\n\nWolf argues that, because natural gas is distributed across state lines, Pennsylvania residents end up paying for the cost of severance taxes in other states.\n\nAnd Wolf says there are two big reasons why a tax won't drive drillers away. The natural gas is here, for one. The industry has also invested billions of dollars in new pipelines to move the gas to new customers– in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nAnd the state is smack dab in the middle of the richest market in the world for the products that come out of this, Wolf said.\n\nThat gives the state an advantage over Texas, Louisiana and Alberta, Canada, he said.\n\n\n\nWho supports Restore PA?\n\nIn the state House, the legislation was introduced with 99 co-sponsors. That's nearly a majority of members supporting the measure in the 203-seat chamber.\n\nOf those 99 lawmakers, 83 are Democrats and 16 are Republicans.\n\nHalf of those Republican co-sponsors represent part of the Philly suburbs: Delaware, Bucks, Montgomery and Chester counties.\n\nIn the 50-seat state Senate, the legislation was introduced with 25 co-sponsors: 21 Democrats and 4 Republicans.\n\nThree of the four Republicans represent only or mostly the Philly suburbs. The fourth is Sen. Mario Scavello, who represents parts of Monroe and Northampton counties.\n\nWolf has also received endorsements from community leaders across the state — although, he acknowledged, relatively few north of Interstate 80.\n\n(The Wolf administration created the below map of community endorsements.)\n\nMaybe I'm not explaining it as well as I should, but those areas above Route 80 are actually places that could use this the most, where broadband doesn't exist, Wolf said on WITF's Smart Talk.\n\nThe lack of broadband hurts people's access to business, schools and healthcare — and he said once autonomous vehicles become a reality, areas without broadband won't have them.\n\nWhy Pennsylvania has never enacted a severance tax\n\nSince Pennsylvania's natural gas boom began around 2008, there have been calls to implement a severance tax, but it's never happened. Why? As StateImpact Pennsylvania has reported, a lot of it comes down to the power of the natural gas lobby.\n\nShortly after the gas boom started, in 2009, the state House (then controlled by Democrats) passed a severance tax. It was defeated by Republicans in the Senate.\n\nCourtesy: Roxburynews.com\n\nInstead of a tax, Pennsylvania came up with a unique way of handling the fiscal impacts of drilling. In 2012, the legislature passed a special impact fee. Gas companies pay a fee for each well they drill. Most of the money goes back to the local governments where drilling is happening.\n\nA severance tax would be paid on how much gas is produced, when drillers sever the resource from the earth. In other words, Pennsylvania taxes holes in the ground — not gas.\n\nIn 2017, the GOP-led state Senate also approved a modest severance tax. It did not advance in the Republican-controlled House.\n\nWhile severance tax talk continued in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania's natural production has skyrocketed. In 2017, the Commonwealth accounted for 19 percent of total U.S. natural gas production — more than any other state, except Texas.\n\nHow much money has the impact fee raised?\n\nAccording to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, the impact fee brought in more than $1.4 billion from 2011 through 2017.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, the Pennsylvania Independent Fiscal Office estimated that the impact fee would generate $247 million for 2018.\n\nWhat happens to the impact fee if Restore PA passes?\n\nIt would remain. Wolf says that impact fee is important for areas directly affected by drilling.\n\nWolf has estimated that his proposed severance tax would bring in about $300 million more a year, on top of the impact fee.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nIn the state House, Democratic Leader Frank Dermody said that members were preparing a discharge resolution to move the Restore PA bill out of the Environmental Resources and Energy Committee if there is not quick enough action on it. It takes a majority vote in the House to pass a discharge resolution, sending it to the full House.\n\nUnder the current legislative calendar, Restore PA supporters wouldn't be able to attempt a discharge resolution in the House until the fall, said House Democratic Caucus spokesman Bill Patton.\n\nAnd there are also procedural moves that a committee chair can take, such as changing the bill significantly through an amendment, to stop a measure passing through a discharge resolution.\n\nIn the Senate, Majority Leader Jake Corman said the Senate doesn't plan to take up the Restore PA bill this month, reported Capitolwire, an online subscription-based news service.\n\nWolf said he's hopeful lawmakers will return to it in the fall.\n\nOften when they say we're going to get to it in the fall, that's just sort of pushing it off into never-never land, Wolf said. But I think this time, it is something that we're all going to come back to in the fall.\n\nEditor's Picks
How Did Trump's And Clinton's Economic Policy Speeches Compare?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mary Altaffer and Chuck Burton/AP Mary Altaffer and Chuck Burton/AP\n\nDespite the vast differences between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, there were some striking similarities between the economic speeches they delivered this week. They both spoke in Michigan, where they both talked a lot about manufacturing, with both of them insisting that they would obtain fairer trade deals.\n\nThat's because both candidates are trying to latch onto — and insist that they can alleviate — a pervasive feeling among Americans that they just can't get ahead, and that it's related to a fast-changing U.S. economy. The candidates, of course, diverge vastly on many issues, but they also have some surprising areas of agreement.\n\nBelow, listen to what they said on five different policy areas, and read how the two candidates differ.\n\nTrade\n\nThat is why I have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever happen. Hillary Clinton will never withdraw from the TPP. She is bought, controlled and paid-for by her donors and special interests. Because my only interest is the American people, I have previously laid out a detailed 7-point plan for trade reform, available on my website. It includes strong protections against currency manipulation, tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods, and it includes a renegotiation of NAFTA. If we don't get a better deal, we will walk away. — Donald Trump\n\nListen To Trump On Trade 1:16\n\nBut the answer is not to rant and rave – or to cut ourselves off from the world. That would end up killing even more jobs. The answer is to finally make trade work for us, not against us. So my message, my message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages – including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as President. — Hillary Clinton\n\nListen To Clinton On Trade 0:45\n\nTrump and Clinton had a similar basic message on trade: I'm for trade deals; just not these trade deals.\n\nTrump, for example, said he would walk away if a renegotiation of NAFTA didn't turn out the way he wanted. And as he later added: Trade has big benefits, and I am in favor of trade. But I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. He also warned that the Trans Pacific Partnership would mean a million lost manufacturing jobs.\n\nAs for what he would do, in that seven-point trade plan he said he would label China a currency manipulator (people accuse China of manipulating its currency's value to exports cheap, meaning other countries' consumers would buy more), crack down on intellectual property theft, and impose tariffs on countries that cheat.\n\nClinton likewise says that she doesn't want the U.S. to cut ourselves off from the world and that trade can work for us. But she also — like Trump — had strong words against TPP: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages – including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as President.\n\nAnd she had many echoes of Trump in her speech — she said in her speech that she would impose targeted tariffs on companies that break the rules. Like Trump, she also pointed to currency manipulation and intellectual property theft as a problem.\n\nTrump's rejection of trade deals fits with one of his own broader campaign narratives: rejecting the establishment. Many Republicans — and, importantly, the Chamber of Commerce, which has given heavy financial support to Republican candidates — support free trade. This is just one way Trump thumbs his nose at more traditional Republican ideas.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nA big part of our plan will be unleashing the power of the private sector to create more jobs at higher pay. And that means for us, creating an infrastructure bank to get private funds off the sidelines and complement our public investments. $25 billion in government seed funding could unlock more than $250 billion and really get our country moving on our infrastructure plans. — Hillary Clinton\n\nListen To Clinton On Infrastructure 0:35\n\nBut we are going to look boldly into the future. We will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, seaports and airports. That believe me folks is what our country deserves. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will connect our cities, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring. We will put new American metal into the spine of this nation. — Donald Trump\n\nListen To Trump On Infrastructure 0:55\n\nAnother area in which Clinton and Trump broadly agree: both want to ramp up infrastructure spending.\n\nClinton has said she wants to spend $275 billion over five years (with additional private spending, eventually). She's proposed an infrastructure bank — an idea that has been around in Washington for decades now (at times, with bipartisan support, though it has been more of a Democratic cause in recent years) but that continually fails to gain much traction.\n\nThe basic idea is that the government would start a fund — in Clinton's case, $25 billion — and use it to finance major projects, for example through loans and loan guarantees (this CBO report is a good background). This can help spur new private investment that construction projects do not currently attract, as the left-leaning Center for American Progress explained in a 2012 report.\n\nTrump likewise in his speech touted infrastructure spending, though he didn't get into detail. However, he has explained those details elsewhere: he has seemed close to Clinton on the idea that something like an infrastructure bank would be the way to fund those projects, as the Wall Street Journal's Nick Timiraos wrote earlier this year, with Americans buying infrastructure bonds.\n\nHowever, he has said he wants to spend $500 billion or more on infrastructure, nearly double what Clinton wants to spend. Because interest rates are low right now, he has said, it is a great time to borrow. This puts him at odds with current Republican economic principles, which have focused more on reducing deficits.\n\nPersonal Taxes\n\nAnd Wall Street corporations, and the super-rich should finally pay their fair share of taxes. That's why I support the so-called Buffett Rule, because multi-millionaires should not be able to pay a lower tax rate than their secretaries. We should also add a new tax on multi-millionaires, crack down on tax gaming by corporations, and close the carried interest loophole – something I've advocated for years. — Hillary Clinton\n\nListen To Clinton On Personal Taxes 0:33\n\nI am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans. This will lead to millions of new and really good-paying jobs. The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs, or undermines our ability as a nation to compete. — Donald Trump\n\nListen To Trump On Personal Taxes 0:23\n\nTrump's tax plan is where he hews much more closely to other Republicans' ideas. In fact, he recently overhauled his initial tax plan (which has been removed from his website) in favor of a new plan with brackets that match those proposed by House Republicans, though Trump has said would also add in a zero bracket. His new plan would lower the top rate from 39.6 percent to 33 percent, and with that zero bracket would have only four brackets, down from the current seven.\n\nThose consolidated, lower rates would largely benefit wealthier taxpayers. Not only that, but Trump would drastically lower the corporate tax rate and eliminate the estate tax — both of which are standard Republican talking points.\n\nAn analysis from the Tax Foundation found that those House Republican income tax brackets would provide tax cuts across the economic spectrum, but that the benefits would be much bigger for rich Americans. The top 1 percent would see their after-tax incomes grow by 5.3 percent, while people below the 80th percentile would see little change, with their incomes growing by less than 1 percent (these figures do not take into account any additional economic effects the plan would have).\n\nAltogether, Trump's plan would slash revenues and thereby grow the deficit. His former plan would have added $9.5 trillion to the deficit over a decade, according to the Tax Policy Center. This one, with its higher income tax rates, would cut that figure, though it's unclear by how much. Larry Kudlow, a CNBC commentator and informal advisor to Trump, said the addition to the deficit would now total $3 trillion.\n\nClinton's plan, meanwhile, goes in the opposite direction: she relies heavily upon taxing the rich, a major way she pays for her other programs. Lower and middle-income people, meanwhile, would see their incomes change little — some with a slight decline — while the richest one percent would see their incomes fall by 5 percent or more, according to an analysis from the Tax Policy Center. The Tax Foundation likewise found few income changes for people who aren't the very highest earners.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center has estimated that Clinton's tax proposals would boost revenue by $1.1 trillion over a decade.\n\nCorporate Taxes\n\nAll of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside of the United States. Under my plan, no American company will pay more than 15 percent of their business income in taxes. In other words, we're reducing your taxes from 35 percent to 15 percent. — Donald Trump\n\nListen To Trump On Corporate Taxes 0:26\n\nRight now, when a corporation outsources jobs and production, it can write off the costs. We must stop that, and we must make them pay back tax breaks they ever received from any level of government in our country. And for those that move their headquarters overseas to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, they're gonna have to pay a new exit tax. So if they want to go, they're going to have to pay to go. — Hillary Clinton\n\nListen To Clinton On Corporate Taxes 0:35\n\nTrump and Clinton both talked about taxes in terms of bringing overseas jobs into the U.S. Trump framed his plan for this as simple: he would drastically lower the federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent — which is high among other advanced economies — to 15 percent, in an attempt to lure businesses into the country. (However, many U.S. businesses take advantage of tax breaks to pay far less than that 35 percent rate right now.)\n\nTrump's 15 percent plan may have an unintended consequence, however; he would apply that rate to pass-through business income, which is taxed at a top rate of 39.6 percent. That benefits the owners of certain types of businesses, allowing them to drastically cut their tax bills, and could encourage people to avoid taxes by changing how they report their earnings.\n\nClinton's framed her business taxes, meanwhile, as a way to stop companies from leaving the U.S. — she would imposes an exit tax on some companies leaving the country, and she also said she would crack down on tax inversions, in which a company moves its headquarters in order to take advantage of lower tax rates overseas.\n\nChild Care\n\nI think instead we should expand the Child Tax Credit to provide real relief to tens of millions of working families struggling with the costs of raising children – the same families that his plan ignores. And that's just a start. Because the more we do to help working families, the more our entire economy will benefit. — Hillary Clinton\n\nListen To Clinton On Child Care 0:21\n\nMy plan will also help reduce the cost of child care by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of childcare spending from their taxes. — Donald Trump\n\nListen To Trump On Child Care 0:11\n\nTrump's child care plan focuses on allowing families to deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes. That was immediately panned this week as largely benefiting richer Americans — higher earners pay higher tax rates, and many lower-and-middle-income households don't pay any federal income tax. Trump's campaign added that they would also have a plan for those lower-income households, allowing them to exclude child care expenses from half their payroll taxes.\n\nClinton swung back in her speech, emphasizing criticisms that Trump's plan would mainly benefit more well-to-do families. She touted her plan, which she said would cap the cost of child care at 10 percent of families' income, but then added that she was also proposing paid family leave, not to mention equal pay policies.\n\nThese kinds of family friendly policies have been at the center of Clinton's campaign throughout this election season. Though Trump is venturing into this territory, she seemed to be saying that she owns this policy area far more than he does.\n\nIt's not clear how much these programs would cost, but they could get expensive. Trump's would cut the tax liabilities of richer families in particular. Clinton's, meanwhile, would expand the Child Tax Credit and further subsidize child care, as the Washington Post has reported. The Huffington Post pointed to Sanders' universal child care plan — which, admittedly, is not quite the same as Clinton's — to provide a sense of scale. The bill for that plan came out at $35 billion per year, by one estimate.\n\nManufacturing\n\nHillary Clinton's Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will be an even bigger disaster for the auto industry. In fact, Ford Motor Company has announced its opposition to the deal. According to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over 1 million manufacturing jobs in 2015. By far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs. — Donald Trump\n\nListen To Trump On Manufacturing 0:46\n\nAnd then in 2000, as the market began to change and some of the auto companies began to realign, [Futuramic was] faced with a choice. We all face choices in life, don't we? And this company could have just said hey, you know, our business is not going to be what it was. We've got to just fold up. Let's, you know, just kind of quit. But that's not what happened here. And what happened here is what can happen across America. — Hillary Clinton\n\nListen To Clinton On Manufacturing 0:33\n\nTrump and Clinton both champion manufacturing in their speeches — it goes hand in hand with their strong rhetoric on trade. Trump focuses on the sharp decline in manufacturing jobs — the U.S. now has around 12.3 million manufacturing jobs, down by more than 7 million from a late-1970s peak. And while automation has helped to eat away at manufacturing jobs, there's also good evidence that China — one of Trump's chief villains when he talks about trade — played a big role in hurting U.S. manufacturing jobs.\n\nHowever, it's important to point out that the manufacturing industry itself is doing pretty well, something that isn't readily apparent from Trump's rhetoric. In fact, manufacturing output is about where it was at its pre-recession peak.\n\nTrump connected his manufacturing ideas with his plans for infrastructure and trade (for which, see above): he said that the goods used to produce this new infrastructure would be made in America, and he focused on foreign competitors (in particular China) whom he says have severely hurt American manufacturing. Tougher trade enforcement with China, he said, could reshore millions of jobs.\n\nClinton, meanwhile, seems to be saying that looking to manufacturing's past is the wrong strategy; she emphasized this with an anecdote about how Futuramic (the company where she spoke) moved from auto supply to aerospace manufacturing to remain profitable.\n\nLike Trump, she linked tougher trade policy to boosting manufacturing jobs. However, she also touted other specific plans that fit with her innovation-themed speech, like expanding scientific research that can create entire new industries. She also touted a tax credit aimed at boosting low-income areas.\n\nThe manufacturing industry has become fertile ground in an election season where populist candidates like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have been unexpectedly successful.\n\nThough the industry employs a relatively small share of Americans, the emphasis on manufacturing — a strong sector that nevertheless has lost millions of jobs — may nevertheless resonate with the many Americans who hear that the economy is recovering, yet feel that they no longer have the opportunities for prosperity that they once had.
California Says Goodbye To Jerry Brown, State's Longest-Serving Governor\n\nAfter a long political career, it's Jerry Brown's last day in office. He is retiring after four terms as the governor of California, and we remember his time through some of his more memorable quips.\n\nNOEL KING, HOST:\n\nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown finishes his term today. He's always liked reeling off Latin quotes and obscure literary and historical references. Ben Adler of Capital Public Radio has a reporter's notebook of some of Brown's more memorable quips during his final go-round as governor.\n\nBEN ADLER, BYLINE: You might expect a drop in entertainment value when a movie star leaves the governor's office. But Jerry Brown took California politics from Arnold Schwarzenegger's...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER: I'll be back.\n\nADLER: To Latin.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJERRY BROWN: I've often used the phrase from Thomas Hobbes, bellum omnes contra omnes - or rather, bellum omni contra omnes.\n\nADLER: That was Brown quoting a 17th century English philosopher during a state budget update in May 2011, back when California faced a $27 billion deficit. He was urging Republicans to strike a deal that would let voters decide whether to extend expiring tax increases. Otherwise, he translated...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBROWN: ...War of all against all. It will be - everyone will return to their corner and devise strategies on what California does.\n\nADLER: There was no deal. So later that year, after signing a budget with automatic cuts if state revenues came in below projections, Brown again turned to Latin.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBROWN: There's a very simple - I wanted to invoke a Latin phrase here - nemo dat non habet. It means, no man gives what he does not have. The state cannot give what it does not have.\n\nADLER: Brown would also sprinkle in little quips when speaking off the cuff. For example, in September of 2011, as he was slogging through hundreds of bills on his desk...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBROWN: Not every human problem needs a law.\n\nADLER: ...A statement he sometimes echoed in his veto messages, which themselves were often quite entertaining. And last month, at the Sacramento Press Club, he put forth perhaps the most Jerry Brown quote ever.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBROWN: I'm not here to make news. I'm here to enlighten you.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nADLER: As for literary and historical references, you'd be hard-pressed to top the 20 that Brown weaved into his 2013 State of the State address. For example...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)\n\nBROWN: Oliver Wendell Holmes.\n\nGenesis.\n\nThen the lean cows ate up the fat cows.\n\nQuiz-bits (ph).\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats.\n\nThe principle of subsidiarity.\n\nThe Little Engine That Could.\n\nADLER: And in his 2017 State of the State...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBROWN: Let me end in the immortal words of Woody Guthrie...\n\nADLER: Brown quoted Guthrie's progressive folk anthem, This Land Is Your Land, as he urged a state still reeling from President Trump's election to respond with courage and perseverance.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBROWN: Nobody living can ever make me turn back. This land was made for you and me.\n\nCalifornia's not turning back - not now, not ever. His truth is marching on.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nADLER: That last line, an ad-lib inserted in the moment, from another famed American anthem, The Battle Hymn Of The Republic.

'Punishment Without Crime' Highlights The Injustice Of America's Misdemeanor System\n\nFormer federal public defender Alexandra Natapoff says 13 million misdemeanors are filed each year in the U.S., trapping the innocent, punishing the poor and making society more unequal.\n\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. We're going to talk about a part of the criminal justice system that my guest describes as trapping the innocent and making America more unequal - the massive misdemeanor system. Depending on where you are, some misdemeanors are as minor as jaywalking. But the consequences of being charged with a misdemeanor, whether you are guilty or not, can be life-changing, especially if you are poor. My guest, Alexandra Natapoff, is the author of the new book, Punishment Without Crime. Critics of how the criminal justice system deals with misdemeanors have described it as assembly line justice or McJustice.\n\nNatapoff is a professor of law at the University of California, Irvine. From 2000 to 2003, she was an assistant federal public defender in Baltimore. She drew on those experiences for the book, but it's also based on extensive data she collected from every state around the country and on interviews with people who've gone through the misdemeanor process, as well as police, prosecutors, public defenders and judges.\n\nAlexandra Natapoff, welcome to FRESH AIR. Let's start with a precedent-setting case from 1997 in which a mother was driving with her 3 and 5-year-old children in the car, and she was arrested for a seatbelt violation. Describe what she was arrested for.\n\nALEXANDRA NATAPOFF: Gail Atwater and her kids were driving around their local park very slowly - about 15 miles an hour. Her child, Mac, had lost his toy and the kids were looking out the window of their truck to try to find the toy. And they didn't have their seatbelt on. Their mom had told them they could take their seatbelts off in order to see out the windows to look for the toy.\n\nAnd they were stopped by a police officer, Turek, who pulled them over and hollered at Gail Atwater that she would be arrested for the seatbelt violation for not having her children in the seatbelt restraints. Her children started to cry. Ms. Atwater asked if she could take her kids to the neighbor's house. Officer Turek said, no, they're going to come to jail with you. A neighbor happened to walk by and take care of the kids, but Gail Atwater went to jail.\n\nShe was booked, fingerprinted, spent a couple hours in the lockup and eventually pled guilty to and paid the fine for the seatbelt violation. The most she could have been punished for that violation was $50. It's a traffic misdemeanor. She could not have gone to jail for the seatbelt violation, but nevertheless spent time in jail as a result of the arrest.\n\nAnd she brought a lawsuit. She asked the Supreme Court to hold that it's unreasonable for police officers to effectuate what we call full-fledged custodial arrest - that is, lock someone up, book them, take them to jail for a crime like hers, for which she could not have gone to jail. It was a fine-only traffic offense. And the Supreme Court ruled against her.\n\nThe Supreme Court said no matter what the crime, no matter how minor the misdemeanor, no matter what the ultimate punishment is, even if you can't be incarcerated for it, the police have the power to effectuate a full-fledged custodial arrest - that is, take you to jail, book you, lock you up.\n\nAnd it really - it was such an important case because it opens a gateway into the kinds of arrests and intrusions and jail stays that characterize this low-level world of misdemeanors and minor offenses. And so in many ways, the size and the harshness of the misdemeanor system trace back to Gail Atwater.\n\nGROSS: So how long was she in jail?\n\nNATAPOFF: Gail Atwater spent a few hours that day in jail. She was booked. They took her personal possessions. She was fingerprinted. She spent the time in the lockup as anybody would if they were arrested for any offense in that jurisdiction.\n\nSo although I don't know who Gail Atwater spent her afternoon with in the lockup, it's possible that anyone in her situation could have spent the afternoon with people accused of very serious crimes, violent offenders, people with mental health or substance abuse issues. And she had an arrest record, so her information now is in the booking system. And it's an arrest record that will follow her for the rest of her life.\n\nGROSS: When you say she had a record, this is her record. She didn't have one before this.\n\nNATAPOFF: Correct.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. So let's talk more about what a misdemeanor is. Not having your children wear seatbelts - that's a misdemeanor. But there's a wide range of crimes that qualify as misdemeanors. Can you give us a sense of that range?\n\nNATAPOFF: So misdemeanors are minor offenses. Every jurisdiction defines them differently. Typically, they're defined as any criminal offense for which you can do no more than one year incarceration as punishment. But misdemeanors come in all kinds of shapes and sizes. Sometimes we call them petty offenses. Sometimes we call them violations or ordinance violations. In Texas, Gail Atwater's offense - her seatbelt offense - even though she couldn't go to jail for it, was a criminal offense. It was a criminal misdemeanor.\n\nMany jurisdictions criminalize their traffic offenses. Even though we don't typically think of speeding as a crime, 25 states define speeding as a misdemeanor. Sometimes people go to jail for these offenses, more often they don't, at least not right away. And so it's a whole world of low-level petty offenses, criminalizing low-level conduct, imposing punishments that are relatively light compared to the kinds of felony sentences that we've become accustomed to.\n\nGROSS: So your book is, in part, about the inequality of the misdemeanor system and how it's racially unequal and there's a class system within the misdemeanor system. So I don't know what kind of income the woman who was arrested for the seatbelt violation had, but what are the differences in how that might've been handled between a person who had money and a person who didn't?\n\nNATAPOFF: One of the startling things about our enormous misdemeanor system is just how unequal it is. It often goes after low income and impoverished individuals. It sweeps in people of color, often disproportionately, for order maintenance and other low-level offenses. One of the particularly burdensome and inegalitarian aspects of low-level offenses is the effect of imposing fines and fees on misdemeanor defendants.\n\nSo Gail Atwater, for example, it appears that she didn't have any trouble paying the $50 fine for her seatbelt violation, but many people do. And for many people, they are set bail for low-level offenses - hundreds of dollars which they cannot pay - and therefore languish in jail while their cases are being resolved.\n\nJurisdictions also impose fees in addition to fines - user fees that fund the criminal system itself. And so there are all kinds of ways that an encounter with the misdemeanor system generates criminal debt. Individuals who come into the system incur all kinds of debt - fines and fees and bail and other kinds of monetary penalties. And for the low-income individuals who typically, you know, represent the average person who encounters the misdemeanor system, that debt can be crushing.\n\nIt can be unpayable, so much so that they end up spending time in jail that they otherwise wouldn't have spent. If they do pay those fines, it can cast them into deep debt, ruin their credit. They may end up on probation solely in order to pay off those fines because the fines are so crushing. So now they're under court supervision, not because they committed a particularly terrible offense or because they need supervision, but merely because they cannot pay.\n\nSo there is a profoundly regressive quality to the way that the misdemeanor system deploys fines and fees and bail and monetary sanctions. And because the system is heavily funded by those fines and fees and monetary sanctions, the misdemeanor system turns out to be a kind of regressive tax policy. It's stripping the poor and the - and working people in the system of their wealth and their resources in order to fund itself.\n\nGROSS: Let's talk about bail. I mean, what is the purpose of bail, and how do you think it's being misused now?\n\nNATAPOFF: The purpose of bail is supposed to be to ensure that people appear for court when they're charged with an offense. When people are charged with an offense, they're, of course, presumptively innocent. They haven't been convicted of anything. So bail has nothing to do with whether anyone is guilty or innocent. It's essentially a deposit that the court can require of an individual to make sure that they come back to court.\n\nBut what has happened in the misdemeanor system is that bail has morphed into a tool for raising money, for extracting fines and fees from individuals and has contributed to a sort of misdemeanor version of mass incarceration. Many jurisdictions have bail schedules, a set list of fees for various low-level offenses.\n\nSo if you're charged with trespassing, your bail is automatically $500. If you're charged with marijuana possession, your bail is automatically $1,000. These amounts have nothing to do with whether this particular individual is a flight risk, whether they're dangerous. Rather, they're just set schedules.\n\nAnd for many people, those bail fees are out of reach. And so they remain incarcerated because they can't pay. And so we've seen around the country - many jails are filled with individuals who are there not because they've done anything particularly wrong or pose any particular threat or even a risk of flight but simply because they can't afford to pay bail.\n\nGROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Alexandra Natapoff, author of the new book Punishment Without Crime: How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps The Innocent And Makes America More Unequal. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PAUL SIMON SONG, HOW CAN YOU LIVE IN THE NORTHEAST?)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Alexandra Natapoff. She is the author of the new book Punishment Without Crime: How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps The Innocent And Makes America More Unequal. She's also a professor at the University of California, Irvine and a former assistant federal public defender in Baltimore.\n\nYou mentioned that fees and fines are used to fund things. And by things, do you mean, like, to fund cities and counties and municipalities - that those funds go into funding the system? So in that sense, kind of like traffic tickets, they're an important part of fundraising for the budget.\n\nNATAPOFF: And misdemeanors are moneymakers for local jurisdictions. They fund courts. They fund probation offices. They fund public defender offices. They fund prosecutor offices. Some counties and municipalities use them to fund the general budget. It's one of the covert aspects of the misdemeanor system that, in many instances, it's running, not aimed at rounding up dangerous people or solving crimes or protecting public safety but cities and institutions and courts are reliant on the revenue stream that the misdemeanor system produces. It's a real distortion, you know, of what our criminal system is for.\n\nOur criminal system is an extraordinarily important public, democratic institution. We need it to go after dangerous people. We need it for deterrence and for public safety. And yet, the misdemeanor system has quietly converted much of the misdemeanor apparatus into a revenue source. Whatever we think of punishment - whatever we think the purposes of criminal punishment are, raising money is not supposed to be one of them.\n\nGROSS: I think, for some areas, the police are expected to - or may be required to - pull over a certain number of people per month. Like, there's a quota. And I'm wondering if you think that contributes to problems within the misdemeanor system.\n\nNATAPOFF: We've recently learned through lawsuits and through police officers speaking out that many police departments rely on quotas - sometimes formal, more often informal - pressures on police officers to produce a certain number of arrests or citations or summons in order to measure their productivity or in order to support their promotion or their advancement in the department. And we've heard from police officers just how distorting these formal or informal quotas can be. They put pressure on officers to make arrests that they might not otherwise make, to issue summons and citations that otherwise might not be justified.\n\nThere have been lawsuits in New York from police officers that, when they are assigned to low-income communities of color, under pressure from these quotas, they feel forced to contribute to the racial disproportion of the criminal system - that in essence, because they've been assigned to communities of color, that they have to issue citations, that they have to engage in arrests, even when some other police action or some other intervention might be more appropriate.\n\nAnd it is a distortion of the police function. Police discretion is an extraordinarily important resource in the criminal system. We rely on police discretion to advance public safety, to make sure people are treated fairly. And when we put pressure on police officers to produce citations and low-level arrests when they might not otherwise exercise their discretion that way, we're really interfering with a key aspect of the system's integrity.\n\nGROSS: In your book, you write that you were a federal public defender in Baltimore from 2000 to 2003. And one of the things you learned from the people you represented there was that there was a very messy calculation of punishment - trying to decide, like, whether to plead guilty or pay a fine or you know. Give us a sense of what that calculation of punishment is when you're facing a misdemeanor charge and you don't have much money.\n\nNATAPOFF: I learned an enormous amount from the people that I represented in Baltimore - listening to their stories, meeting them and their families and hearing how they grappled with the challenges of facing a low-level misdemeanor charge. And I learned that often the calculus of punishment doesn't necessarily shake out the way you would think.\n\nThere might be an assumption, for example, that people would avoid jail at any cost. And yet, for many of my clients, being on probation for a year or two or three years with the burdens and intrusions of probation - having to make appointments and meet with their probation officers monthly, having to be drug tested routinely, giving up their privacy, having the restrictions on their freedom - for many of them, they decided that, for them, going to jail made more sense. Even though they knew that jail was risky, that it was dangerous, that it was painful, the intrusion into their lives and the burdens on their lives of supervision and probation often seemed, in the long run, to be even more disruptive.\n\nMany of my clients lived in dangerous neighborhoods. They were surrounded by dangerous situations. They often felt caught between a rock and a hard place. So I represented individuals, for example, who were charged with misdemeanor gun possession who knew that if they were caught they would be punished. And yet, they felt the pressure from their neighbors - from the people in their neighborhoods that if they did not carry a gun or at the very least were not perceived to be carrying a weapon, that they would be in danger, that they would be seen as a target. It was a heartbreaking calculus that they had to go through.\n\nGROSS: So in terms of lack of resources, among the things you're mentioning is the resource of time, that public defenders don't have enough time to represent all the clients that they're supposed to be representing, and judges don't have time to hear all the cases they're supposed to be hearing. So what are the consequences of that?\n\nNATAPOFF: The lack of resources in the misdemeanor system is one of the great challenges to the integrity of that process. And the reason that there's a lack of time is because the case loads are so enormous. There are so many people coming in to the misdemeanor system. Thirteen million misdemeanor cases are filed every year in this country. That's 80 percent of American criminal dockets.\n\nAnd so for public defenders - and it's worth noting that every official - every legal official in the misdemeanor system is faced with this crushing case load. Public defenders, prosecutors and judges are all under pressure to move cases along. For public defenders in particular, having hundreds, sometimes thousands of cases that they have to resolve means that they don't have time to talk to their clients.\n\nThey may meet them literally in the lockup in the courtroom 10 minutes before a hearing with no time to discuss the case, the facts, the file. This is sometimes referred to derogatorily as meet-them-and-plead-them lawyering, that essentially your public defender meets you. They tell you what the government's deal is, and they engage in the process of you pleading guilty immediately.\n\nThe lack of resources also means that public defenders lack the ability to investigate cases. So there are very few, if any, investigators and public defender offices available for misdemeanors, so if an individual is innocent or if there are witnesses or if there are facts about the encounter with the police or the crime that could be uncovered, that public defender office may simply be unable to unearth that information.\n\nThe lack of resources means also that in many ways, the law itself is put aside. Misdemeanor cases can be legally very complicated. They may involve unconstitutional searches and seizures. They may involve unconstitutional statutes. They may involve complicated factual issues. But without the time and resources to engage those questions, there's very little litigation. Motions are not filed. Issues are not aired both because public defenders lack the resources but also because there's enormous pressure on them from prosecutors and judges not to litigate.\n\nWe've seen around the country examples of judges who actually punish public defenders when they try to litigate issues on behalf of their clients when they want to go to trial, when they want to file a motion. Judges have been known to hold public defenders in contempt or threaten to hold them in contempt because they're holding up the docket.\n\nAnd so it's not the way that we think a judicial system is supposed to work. There's little room for law. There's little room for investigation. There's little room to have the adversarial conversation that we rely on to produce valid cases and valid convictions.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Alexandra Natapoff, author of the new book Punishment Without Crime: How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps The Innocent And Makes America More Unequal. We'll talk more after a break, and Lloyd Schwartz will review a new recording of Stravinsky's The Soldier's Tale made by Roger Waters, co-founder of the rock band Pink Floyd. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ANTONIO SANCHEZ AND BRAD MEHLDAU AND MATT BREWER'S NAR-THIS)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Alexandra Natapoff, author of the new book Punishment Without Crime: How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps The Innocent And Makes America More Unequal. She's a professor of law at the University of California Irvine and, before that, was an assistant federal public defender in Baltimore. When we left off, she was describing how people accused of misdemeanors who don't have extra cash on hand face a backlogged justice system with public defenders who don't have adequate time or resources to properly defend their clients, so the clients are often encouraged to take a plea whether or not they're guilty.\n\nYou mentioned that part of the misdemeanor system is often referred to as meet them and plead them, so, you know, lawyers encourage - often encourage their clients to just like plead guilty and get it done with. So if you decide to take the conviction and you take the plea, what are the consequences of that? Now you have a record.\n\nNATAPOFF: So one of the great fallacies of the misdemeanor universe is that getting a misdemeanor is no big deal, that it's just a misdemeanor, that it won't dog you for your life. And that has come to be, you know, profoundly untrue. A misdemeanor conviction, although of course not as serious as a felony conviction, still imposes enormous burdens on the people who carry them.\n\nFirst and foremost, a conviction is accompanied by punishment. It can be crushing fines and fees. They may be on supervision, on probation for long periods of time. They may be incarcerated. If they're not incarcerated upfront, they may be incarcerated if they violate their probation or fail to pay their fines and fees. And then that conviction will - is a permanent conviction that follows them for the rest of their lives.\n\nWe know that it interferes with employment. It can mean that they lose welfare benefits, become ineligible for financial aid for education. They can lose their housing. It can threaten their immigration status. It can disqualify them for all kinds of jobs and licenses.\n\nSo the consequences of a misdemeanor conviction are far from petty, even though the conversation around misdemeanors, you know, really doesn't appreciate the impact that they impose.\n\nGROSS: So we've talked a little bit about how the misdemeanor system penalizes the poor more than people who have money because the poor can't afford to pay bail or fines or fees. What are the fees that you're referring to?\n\nNATAPOFF: So fees are different than fines. A fine is a punishment. It's punishment for whatever offense you are guilty of. It's typically set by statute. The judge decides how severe your fine will be as punishment for your crime. But fees are not punishment. They are user charges, in effect, that the criminal system imposes on people who go through it for all kinds of functions. They're essentially money-raising mechanisms that, for decades now, have been growing and growing as municipalities, counties and states rely more and more heavily on the revenue stream from the misdemeanor system.\n\nSo their fees can include jail fees, supervision fees, fees for applying for the public defender, fees for using the public defender, fees for drug testing, fees when they swab your cheek to put your DNA in the database. They'll charge you a fee if you don't show up to court, and they issue a warrant, they'll issue a fee. If you're late paying your fees, they'll charge you a fee.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, the list of fees, ranging from a few dollars here to $10, $20, $30 or a hundred dollars there, can add up to hundreds, even thousands of dollars on top of whatever punitive fine the court decides to impose.\n\nGROSS: So wait a minute. You're charged a fee for paying - paying for your own incarceration in jail. And you're charged a fee to have a public defender and - when the whole idea of having a public defender is that it's a free lawyer to represent you.\n\nNATAPOFF: I think it's hard for people to really fathom just how unfairly the misdemeanor system strips poor people of their wealth, or more accurately, wealth that they don't have. One of the most infamous is fees charged for the application for the public defender. Of course, by definition, you're only eligible for a public defender if you can't afford a lawyer. And yet, nevertheless, many jurisdictions charge a fee - say, a $50 fee - to apply just to get a public defender assigned. And many people forgo a public defender because the fee is prohibitive.\n\nThe Supreme Court has upheld the use of what they sometimes called recoupment fees. So if you use a public defender, the state can come after you and ask for money to pay for that even though, again, by definition, you would only be eligible for a public defender because you can't afford a lawyer in the first place.\n\nJail fees are particularly egregious and ironic for individuals who are being incarcerated precisely because they couldn't pay their fines and fees. Once they go to jail, in many jurisdictions, the jail will then charge them a fee for having been in the jail. There are fees for the use of health care in jails, so many people forgo health care. They forgo their medication because they can't afford the fee in the jail to get access to their medication. It's really this enormous underground wealth-stripping, regressive mechanism that is only just starting to come to light.\n\nGROSS: So I just want to make sure - I know a lot of our listeners are probably thinking, is this person arguing that misdemeanors should not be punished or that there shouldn't be misdemeanors or that everybody should just be left alone - no jail, no fees or fines or bail? So what are you arguing for? I mean, you want reform, but you're not arguing to do away with the misdemeanor system.\n\nNATAPOFF: No, I'm not arguing to do away with the misdemeanor system. We need to be able to respond to low-level crimes, to low-level harms. It's not OK to take other people's stuff. It's not OK to engage in low-level violence. It's not OK to drive drunk. And so in many ways mirroring the mass incarceration debate, we need to dial it back.\n\nWe need to dial back this enormous, bloated misdemeanor system. We need to dial back arrests. We need to dial back incarceration. We need to dial back the penalties and the use of debtors' prison so that the misdemeanor system can do its job, so that it can go after crime and low-level offenses in a meaningful way and impose punishments that are not so wildly disproportionate to the crime.\n\nGROSS: Let me reintroduce you here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Alexandra Natapoff. She's the author of the new book, Punishment Without Crime: How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps The Innocent And Makes America More Unequal. We're going to take a short break and then we'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Alexandra Natapoff. She's the author of the new book, Punishment Without Crime: How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps The Innocent And Makes America More Unequal. She's also a professor at the University of California, Irvine and a former assistant federal public defender in Baltimore.\n\nWhat are a couple of the reforms you would like to see in the misdemeanor system?\n\nNATAPOFF: So many of the problems of the misdemeanor system flow from its sheer enormity. And there are things that we can do about that. Police could arrest fewer people. We could put less pressure on police officers to arrest and to issue summons when it's unnecessary. Prosecutors can decline more cases. When police officers arrest, prosecutors then have to decide whether that arrest is going to convert into a criminal case or whether it's going to be declined and remain merely an arrest.\n\nAnd prosecutors could shrink the pipeline by declining more low-level cases in which an arrest is enough. It was enough of an intervention and enough of a punishment - decriminalization, reduced use of jail, the reduced use of bail, as we're starting to see in jurisdictions across the country. There are any number of points along the misdemeanor pipeline which we could meaningfully and sensibly shrink it so that it can - so that the cases that are left can get our full attention.\n\nGROSS: Are you convinced that that would not encourage people to break laws because there wouldn't be consequences or at least there wouldn't be consequences as great as there are today.\n\nNATAPOFF: So many of the reasons that people are incarcerated in the misdemeanor system have nothing to do with their wrongdoing. When individuals are locked up because they can't pay a fine or a fee, it's not because they're scofflaws. It's because they're poor. When individuals are arrested for loitering or trespassing because the police are under pressure to clear a corner or make a quota, it's not because they're scofflaws. It's not because they're dangerous.\n\nThey're caught up in a system that's using misdemeanor arrest and using misdemeanor processing in unfair and dysfunctional ways. And I think there is a lot of room in our misdemeanor system to scale back those practices so that we can concentrate on misdemeanors that cause real harm - the drunk driving and the assaults and the domestic violence that require our attention and make our misdemeanor system more truly effective and a better deterrent.\n\nGROSS: I want to switch topics to an earlier book that you wrote, a 2009 book called Snitching: Criminal Informants And The Erosion Of American Justice. And this book was about the government's use of criminal suspects and criminal defendants to get information in exchange for deals to get, you know, somebody to talk or to, you know, name another person who is guilty of something in return for leniency for the informant's crimes. What do you think is the problem with that kind of approach?\n\nNATAPOFF: The problem with snitching, with the use of criminal informants, is that it is the most extreme version of a basic truth about the American criminal system, which is that ours is a system of negotiation. It's essentially a market. Ninety-five percent of all the convictions in this country, felony and misdemeanor, are the result of a plea. They're not a result of a trial. We almost never litigate guilt anymore.\n\nAnd so within this market, we've created a kind of a black market, if you will, of cooperation, of deals between the government and individuals who are suspect or who have committed a crime in which guilt and information and cooperation are traded, often off the record, informally, without constraint.\n\nAnd so this kind of black market of trading guilt and information has really undermined a lot of the integrity of the criminal system. Criminals are getting away with very serious offenses. Often, individual - vulnerable individuals are pressured into becoming informants at great risk to their lives. The government can launder a lot of its mistakes through cooperation and through the plea-bargaining process. So it's an opaque, under-regulated aspect of a market that is all - that hasn't gotten enough attention.\n\nGROSS: I know you're also concerned that somebody who is bargaining for leniency in return for information isn't necessarily telling the truth.\n\nNATAPOFF: So there's some big, famous problems with the use of criminal informants. One is wrongful conviction. Informants often lie in order to get a deal. Informants also often continue to commit their own crimes. They get a kind of impunity from cooperating with the government. A lot of it is very secretive, so it's a kind of off-the-record aspect - big off-the-record aspect of the criminal justice system.\n\nAnd all these things work in tandem to create troubling cases and troubling outcomes. It's not that the government should never be able to cut a deal. It's that for such an important public policy, we should know more about it. The government should be more accountable. These cases should be better scrutinized.\n\nGROSS: So in light of what you just told us about what you describe as snitching, what do you think of the use of giving information in return for a more lenient sentence as is being done by the Mueller investigation and the Southern District of New York in investigating the Trump administration?\n\nNATAPOFF: So in some ways, those deals and deals like them - by which I mean deals cut by wealthy, powerful, well-represented individuals in a highly scrutinized, transparent environment - are the best version of snitching. White-collar crimes, political crimes like these, where the government has very few options to get information about conspiracies or wrongdoing by powerful, insulated individuals, it's - in my view, it's probably the best version of the informant deal.\n\nThe kinds of informant deals I think we should be worried about are the ones that are not scrutinized, where people - where defendants, for example, are not represented by counsel, where it takes place off the record where no one ever learns about it, where the informant gets to go on and commit additional crimes because the government finds them so useful. But at the top of the pyramid, if you will, in the highly scrutinized, highly resourced environment of these political crimes and the Mueller investigation, that's about as good as we get in terms of the integrity of these kinds of deals.\n\nGROSS: As good as we get, but do you think it's justified?\n\nNATAPOFF: I think time always will tell whether a particular criminal deal is justified or not. And that's a matter for democratic debate. We will know, eventually, what the government learned as a result of these deals. And then the American public can decide whether it made sense to let people who committed serious crimes against our democracy off or gave them more lenient sentences.\n\nI'm not against the use of criminal informant deals in a system where we have already made the decision to negotiate. We live in a world of plea bargaining. And sometimes, it's worth cutting a deal with a terrible person in order to advance public safety and advance justice.\n\nGROSS: Alexandra Natapoff, thank you so much for talking with us.\n\nNATAPOFF: Thanks so much for having me.\n\nGROSS: Alexandra Natapoff is the author of the new book Punishment Without Crime.

Wolf's support for petrochemicals raises climate worries as Pennsylvania tries to cut carbon emissions\n\nPlastics build-out could conflict with governor's climate goals\n\nReid Frazier Bio Recent Stories Reid R. Frazier is an energy reporter for The Allegheny Front, a Pittsburgh-based public media outlet covering the environment in Pennsylvania. His work has aired on NPR and Marketplace.\n\nReid R. Frazier / StateImpact Pennsylvania\n\nSince his second term began last year, there's been a theme for Tom Wolf's tenure as Pennsylvania's governor: climate change.\n\nAfter Pennsylvania experienced the wettest year on record in 2018, Wolf said the state would be setting its first-ever carbon reduction targets — 26 percent by 2025, and 80 percent by 2050, compared to 2005 levels.\n\nHe said floods in 2018 were evidence that climate change had already come to Pennsylvania. Scientists say global warming will make the state's weather wetter, since warm air holds more moisture.\n\nIt's affected our farmers, and the crops that they grow, he said. It's devastated our homes. It's affecting us each and every day.\n\nWolf followed that up with plans to join regional initiatives to reduce carbon from the transportation and electricity sectors.\n\nThe steps pleased many in the environmental community, including Joe Minott of the Clean Air Council.\n\nHe understands climate change, believes that it is already having an impact on Pennsylvania and is proposing to address it, Minott said.\n\nWhile Minott says Wolf deserves praise, there is a but. The governor also supports fossil-fuel and petrochemical industries that contribute to the emissions he wants to eliminate.\n\nWolf has extolled the jobs that Shell's Beaver County Ethane Cracker will create for Western Pennsylvania. The cracker, a massive plant that will turn natural gas into plastic pellets, would be part of (an) energy efficient future, Wolf recently told a radio interviewer.\n\nI think if we get this right, these are going to be jobs that stay here, he told a group of local officials in Beaver County in 2016.\n\nThe plant, which received a $1.65 billion tax credit from Pennsylvania, is under construction, employing around 6,000 people. When it's built in the next few years, it's expected to employ 600.\n\nAlong with jobs, Minott says the ethane cracker will be bringing something else to the region — a large carbon footprint.\n\nFor starters, the plant will further entrench the fossil fuel industry in the state's economy.\n\nThough it's helped the state lower its electricity sector emissions by 33 percent since 2005 by displacing coal, natural gas has its own carbon footprint. It produces carbon dioxide when burned, and gas wells and pipelines leak the potent greenhouse gas methane into the atmosphere.\n\nOn top of that, Minott says, are the cracker's own emissions.\n\nThe Beaver County plant is permitted to emit 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide a year — the equivalent CO2 of 400,000 more cars on the road, according to the EPA's carbon footprint calculator.\n\nThe petrochemical plant is itself a humongous emitter of greenhouse gases, Minott said.\n\nMuch of that CO2 will come from burning natural gas to process ethane, a natural gas byproduct, into plastic.\n\nPut another way — that would be the equivalent of nearly 4 percent of the state's carbon dioxide budget of 58 million tons of CO2 in the state's 2050 climate target.\n\nIt's hard to understand how (Wolf) thinks he's going to be able to achieve the reductions that are needed to meet his 2050 goal, while at the same time (promoting) the petrochemical and the gas industry in Pennsylvania, Minott said.\n\nAnd the Beaver County plant could be just the first of several in the region. ExxonMobil is considering building a petrochemical plant in Western Pennsylvania, according to one report.\n\nLeah Stokes, a scientist at the University of California Santa Barbara who studies climate and politics, says promoting any new fossil fuels at this point — even natural gas — could tip the world over the edge of climate catastrophe by midcentury. Stokes said that even 80 percent carbon reductions would be insufficient to the scale of the climate crisis.\n\nWhat the modeling shows is that if we want to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, which many consider a sort of safe warming level…we cannot build any new fossil fuel infrastructure.\n\nCosta Samaras, an engineer who studies climate change adaptation and resilience at Carnegie Mellon, said meeting the state's climate targets will be made harder by large additions of CO2, like petrochemical plants.\n\nThe math is unforgiving, Samaras said. Infrastructure lasts for a long time and a…plant can run for 30, 40, 50, even longer — 60 years. If we think about a budget that Pennsylvania can use, each new fossil (fuel) infrastructure asset is going to use up some of that budget.\n\nBut Wolf has maintained that natural gas, while not perfect, can be done better. He's proposed a severance tax on gas, and rules to limit methane leaks at wells and tightening other drilling regulations.\n\nThe governor's spokesman J.J. Abbott says Wolf is hemmed in by a Republican legislature that wants fewer rules on oil and gas, not more.\n\nThe governor has been a backstop against some of the proposals (by the legislature) that would reduce our ability to hold the industry accountable to high environmental standards, said Abbott, mentioning the Governor's opposition to SB 790, which would reduce some regulations on the conventional drilling industry, and Energize PA, the GOP's plan to incentive petrochemical development in the state.\n\nReid Frazier / StateImpact Pennsylvania\n\nWolf's stance on the industry has placated the state's big trade unions, a major source of support in his own Democratic party.\n\nJeff Nobers, executive director of the Builders' Guild of Western Pennsylvania, said Wolf's pragmatic approach is better for unions in Pennsylvania than that taken by Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The two U.S. senators each has called for a ban on fracking.\n\nI think the governor's trying to take a very middle of the road approach to this — ensuring certain (environmental protections) on one side while still being able to take advantage, and grow an industry, and create jobs.\n\nIt's also earned him praise from the natural gas industry, which has successfully resisted Wolf's main request of it — a severance tax on gas production. The industry says it already contributes to the state coffers through an impact fee— which in 2018 brought in $251 million.\n\nLike nearly every pragmatic elected official across the political spectrum, Governor Wolf recognizes the compelling environmental and economic benefits of clean-burning American natural gas, said Marcellus Shale Coalition president David Spigelmyer, in a statement. Natural gas remains a strong source of job creation, especially for our building trades and construction laborers, while boosting manufacturing, consumer savings and air quality.\n\nPolitical observers say Wolf's middle of the road strategy plays well in Pennsylvania, the country's No. 2 gas-producing state.\n\nI think as a Democratic governor in a state like Pennsylvania that Tom Wolf has in many ways found a sweet spot, said Chris Borick, a political science professor at Muhlenberg College. Borick points to Wolf's two blowout wins in the state as evidence: he won 55 percent of the vote in 2014, and 58 percent four years later.\n\nHe has found a spot that I think aligns very well with Pennsylvania public opinion, Borick said. He's never called for a moratorium on natural gas, but he's been strong in his proposals and demands for an extraction (or severance) tax.\n\nBorick thinks in a purple state like Pennsylvania, Wolf's balancing act might provide a blueprint for other Democrats to win elections.\n\nHe says that while public opinion on climate change is changing — 68 percent of Pennsylvanians believe climate change is a problem that should be addressed, according to a recent poll — it still isn't seen as critical as other issues, like the economy.\n\nPeople are concerned about it. They think about it. They're seeing it more in their lives, Borick said. But are they at the point where they're willing to go much more in? I don't know if we've reached that point. I think we're headed to that point, but I don't think we're there yet.\n\nCorrection: The caption on the photo of Gov. Tom Wolf in the original version of this story indicated the wrong time period for his visit to Beaver County.\n\nEditor's Picks
In California, Squid Is Big Business. But Good Luck Eating Local Calamari\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rick Loomis/LA Times via Getty Images Rick Loomis/LA Times via Getty Images\n\nCalamari is a favorite on American dinner tables. But while the U.S. has a thriving squid industry, chances are the calamari you are eating made a 12,000-mile round trip before ending up on your dinner plate. That, or it wasn't caught in the U.S. at all.\n\nMore than 80 percent of U.S. squid landings are exported — most of it to China. The rare percentage of that catch that stays domestically goes to Asian fresh fish markets or is used as bait.\n\nIronically, the lion's share of the squid consumed in the United States is imported.\n\nSquid is a labor-intensive product, says Emily Tripp, founder of Marine Science Today, a website on the latest ocean-based research. It's cheaper in some situations to ship it to China to be processed and ship it back.\n\nTripp, who recently graduated with a masters from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, did her thesis project on California market squid, which, during non-El Niño years, is California's most valuable fishery.\n\nIn California, squid is an economic driver of the seafood industry – it's the fifth-largest fishery in the United States by weight. Yet most of this squid is frozen and exported overseas to China to be processed and distributed to over 42 countries across the globe. It's an export market that, according to 2011 figures, is valued at $107 million. Only 1.4 percent of it, on average, makes it back to the U.S. In 2015, that figure was 0.46 percent.\n\nIt has to do with the American desire for a larger squid, explains Diane Pleschner-Steele, executive director of the California Wetfish Producers Association. A lot of squid that is shipped overseas stays overseas because they prefer it. They eat it over there. Our consumers typically prefer a larger squid, and so there's just a ton of squid imported into this country that comes in at a far lower price.\n\nIn the U.S., the squid that ends up on our dinner table is typically Patagonian squid from the Falkland Islands or Humboldt squid — a jumbo cephalopod fished predominantly in Mexico and Peru.\n\nCalifornia market squid isn't usually desired because of its smaller size.\n\nOur squid is a learning curve, Pleschner-Steele says. If you overcook it, it can taste like a rubber band. But in my opinion, if you do it right, it tastes more like abalone than any other squid. It's nutty, sweet and delicate.\n\nThe cost of labor is another, perhaps more significant, factor. Squid cleaning and processing is an extremely time-consuming practice. The eyes, cartilage, skin and guts need to be removed ahead of time, and it's cheaper to have this done overseas than domestically.\n\nA round-trip freight cost to China is $0.10 per pound and labor is just $7 a day there. By contrast, California wages — with tax and health insurance — amount to $12 an hour, according to Pleschner-Steele.\n\nAlso, supply chains and markets are incredibly opaque. Pleschner-Steele suspects that as the Chinese middle-class economy has blossomed, a lot of the squid processing facilities are now based in Thailand.\n\nTripp says during her research, it was nearly impossible to track down where exactly the squid was being processed abroad.\n\nThe biggest challenge was trying to find out where the squid goes when it leaves to the United States, she says. No one wants to say where they partner. It's a bit of a challenge. In the United States we keep such good records of all of our fish and seafood. There's no comparable system in China. I couldn't follow the chain backwards.\n\nRegardless, the narrative is the same: Californians aren't eating Californian squid. And if they are, it likely wasn't processed in California.\n\nAt Mitch's Seafood, a restaurant in San Diego committed to local fish, the owners spent three years looking for a California-based squid processor for their calamari. They eventually found a company in San Pedro called Tri-Marine.\n\nWe have to pay twice as much for it, but it's worth it so that we can say we offer California-caught and processed squid, owner Mitch Conniff says. Squid that's caught two to three miles away takes a 10,000-mile round-trip journey before I can get it back into my restaurant.\n\nAll Californian fish processors are capable of dealing with squid, Pleschner-Steele says. However, it's not a money-making operation because people aren't willing to pay for it.\n\nIt has to be on request, she says. We simply can't compete with the cost of other imported squid. \n\nSupporting the local squid industry is much more than just helping the local economy – it's helpful from a sustainability angle as well.\n\nEven with squid being sent on a round-trip journey across the world, the California market squid fishery has one of the lowest carbon footprints in the industry.\n\nCalifornia squid fishing fleets are one of the most energy efficient in the world because [they're] so close to port, Pleschner-Steele says. Our boats can produce a ton of proteins for about six gallons of diesel fuel. ... Efficiency is key.\n\nFurther efficiency, she says, could be achieved if consumers would be keen to fork over $1.50 a pound more for California-caught and processed squid.\n\nBut the truth is that Americans aren't willing to pay for it, she says. If people were willing to pay the price, we can definitely feed the demand.\n\nClarissa Wei is a freelance journalist based in Los Angeles and Taipei. She writes about sustainability and food.
White House Looks Outside Washington For Republicans Who Back COVID-19 Aid Plan\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nUpdated at 11:10 a.m ET\n\nAs Democrats in Congress take the initial steps to pass President Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package using a process that won't require any Republican votes, the White House is working to rack up endorsements from state and local elected officials and business groups — a strategy that it argues is making the bill bipartisan.\n\nCongressional Republicans say the package is too large and payments should be targeted to people who really need it. In a letter to Biden on Thursday, 10 GOP senators who had met with him noted some of the money appropriated in previous relief packages hasn't yet been spent. It highlights a gulf that will make it difficult to pass a bill that is bipartisan by any traditional definition.\n\nBiden has vowed to try to unite the country, and has said addressing the economic and health crises caused by the coronavirus is his top priority is a big part of that. But constrained by the pandemic, Biden hasn't yet been able to make the case for his plan by taking it on the road to rallies or even kitchen table photo ops, in the way that presidents typically have made large legislative pushes.\n\nInstead, in Zoom meetings and conference calls, the Biden White House is making its pitch to governors and mayors, county executives and state treasurers and secretaries of state, agriculture associations and labor unions, progressive groups and faith leaders.\n\nSome of that has paid off. The U.S. Conference of Mayors urged quick action on the president's plan in a letter to Congress that had so many signatories it ran 11 pages long. State and local governments stand to benefit from the Biden plan, which calls for an infusion of $350 billion to offset pandemic-related losses and expenses.\n\nLocal elected officials see up close how the pandemic has ravaged their communities, said Cedric Richmond, a former Democratic congressman who is now one of Biden's top aides at the White House, in charge of the Office of Public Engagement.\n\nThey understand the hurt, Richmond told NPR.\n\nThat's not going to stop us from trying to get Republican members of Congress, the House and the Senate. But we believe this plan is bipartisan already because it has such support from other Republican elected officials.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll this week found 37% of Republicans support Biden's $1.9 trillion package. But it has strong support from independents and overwhelming support from Democrats, meaning nearly 7 in 10 Americans support the proposal. Individual elements of the plan, particularly the $1,400 direct payments, enjoy strong support.\n\nBiden's push to go big and go fast even yielded an endorsement from the Republican governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice. A vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, Justice told CNN this week that people in his state are really, really hurting and action is needed fast.\n\nAdministration officials are also hitting the airwaves, with a White House official putting the tally at more than 100 national television, radio and podcast interviews since Jan. 21. This week alone, they've done some 30 local TV interviews in Ohio, North Carolina, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana and Colorado. This is a reprisal of Biden's campaign strategy: he traveled less due to the coronavirus, but he did a lot of local TV interviews to bring his message into voters' homes.\n\nVice President Harris has been doing some of those interviews. And on Friday, she and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen plan to hold a Zoom roundtable with members of Black Chambers of Commerce from across the country about the crisis and the aid needed by small businesses.\n\nOne area of stark disagreement between congressional Republicans and President Biden is relief for state and local governments. Republicans continue to argue it would reward states and cities that mismanaged their budgets. The White House has framed this part of the package as being about help for first responders. Richmond says cities that rely on the hospitality industry have been especially hard-hit, losing significant tax revenue.\n\nWe have firefighters that were being furloughed, said Richmond. We have frontline workers that we truly care about and want to support that are struggling and without giving aid to state and local governments, those frontline workers in those states won't receive help.
Senate Republicans Unveil New Coronavirus Relief Package\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nUpdated at 8:10 p.m. ET\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., introduced legislation on Thursday to address the economic impact of the coronavirus. This is the third legislative package to deal with the outbreak.\n\nThe proposal was drafted by Senate Republicans and the Trump administration. The bill still needs to be negotiated with Senate Democrats, which McConnell said would happen Friday. Already some Democrats were criticizing the plan as too focused on help for corporations and were calling for major changes.\n\nThe 247-page bill, dubbed the CARES Act — the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act — provides direct cash payments, loan guarantees for impacted businesses and more resources for testing and development of vaccines.\n\nHere are some key provisions:\n\nCash payments\n\nThe bill includes cash payments of as much as $1,200 per person and $2,400 per married couple. Individuals with an adjusted gross income of less than $75,000, and $150,000 for joint filers, would receive the full payment. People earning over that amount would see their payments reduced by $5 for each $100 in income over that amount. The benefit completely phases out for individuals earning over $99,000 and married couples making more than $198,000.\n\nPeople with incomes under $2,500 would be eligible for $600, or $1,200 for a married couple.\n\nSmall-business loans\n\nBusinesses with fewer than 500 employees could apply for fee-free loans of up to $10 million that could help cover payroll, employee salaries, mortgages, rent and some other debt obligations. Businesses that retain their employees and payroll levels between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, would have any of that money used for payments on preexisting debt and payroll forgiven.\n\nIndustry-specific loan guarantees\n\nThe bill includes $208 billion in loan guarantees for industries that are hurting because of the coronavirus. This includes up to $50 billion for airlines, $8 billion for cargo carriers and $150 billion for other unnamed businesses.\n\nHealth care\n\nThe bill would require the Food and Drug Administration to prioritize and expedite the review of new drugs. It also includes requirements that insurers pay for COVID-19 testing without a fee for patients; free coverage, without cost sharing, of certain vaccines as they become available; and $1.32 billion in additional funding for community health centers.\n\nTax deadline\n\nThe legislation would move the tax-filing deadline from April 15 to July 15 for most filers.\n\nStudent loans\n\nThe bill allows for people to defer payments on federal student loans and allows students whose universities have canceled classes to keep Pell Grants.\n\nThe bill: We want to get something done quickly and boldly\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer complained that Democrats weren't involved in the drafting of the bill but said he wanted to work with Republicans to get something done quickly. In a statement on Thursday evening, Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that to earn their support, any economic stimulus proposal must include new, strong and strict provisions that prioritize and protect workers, such as banning the recipient companies from buying back stock, rewarding executives, and laying off workers.\n\nOther Democrats have begun highlighting areas that they say fall short. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he is disappointed that the bill doesn't have sufficient funding for first responders and other front-line medical professionals, among other complaints.\n\nIt inadequately funds federal, state, and local efforts on the ground to blunt the spread of this disease and prevent our health care system from being overwhelmed, Leahy said in a statement. It fails to invest in programs the American people will rely on during this crisis, which have already begun to reach a breaking point.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., criticized the airline-specific loans as a blank check bailout that lacks protections for workers and consumers.\n\nThis proposal totally fails to prevent the corporate excesses and abuses that followed past taxpayer bailouts, Blumenthal said in a statement. Instead of corporate welfare, there should be grants and loan forgiveness for small businesses, which are the job creating backbone of our economy.\n\nDemocrats will have an opportunity to make changes to the bill in the coming days. Several lawmakers have said they hope to pass a final bill by the end of next week.\n\nThe bill proposal comes a day after two members of Congress tested positive for COVID-19 and President Trump signed a second relief bill that provides paid sick leave, expanded unemployment assistance and resources for testing.\n\nMcConnell had been in close contact with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in recent days as they rushed to draft a bill that reflects a GOP-wide consensus. McConnell now says talks with Schumer will start on Friday.\n\nAs soon as Congress passes this, we'd get this out within three weeks, Mnuchin said. Six weeks later, if the president still has a national emergency, we will deliver another $3,000 [for a family of four].\n\nMnuchin said the plan also includes $300 billion for small-business loans. The loans are intended to be used for hiring and maintaining payroll and could be forgiven down the line.\n\nMcConnell spoke about the bill on the Senate floor on Thursday before the draft was released. He said the legislation would include billions of dollars in forgivable federal loans for small businesses.\n\nOwners will not be able to use the funds to give themselves raises or increase their own profits, McConnell said. The point is to help small businesses endure, help workers keep their jobs and help workers and businesses emerge from this ready to thrive.\n\nIndustry-specific aid, including money for airlines, would be in the form of targeted lending, which McConnell described as government loans.\n\nJust like small businesses, entire sectors are being crushed by public health guidance, which is obviously no fault of their own, McConnell said. We are talking about loans that must be repaid.\n\nHe added that Congress will have future opportunities to address the long-term impact of the coronavirus crisis when it writes regular annual spending bills later in the year.\n\nThe legislation I have just laid out will not be the last word, McConnell said. This is not Congress' last chance to legislate, but it is critical that we move swiftly and boldly to begin to stabilize our economy.\n\nSchumer acknowledged in an interview on NPR's Morning Edition that there is public pressure for lawmakers to set aside differences and pass a bill quickly.\n\nWe don't want to be partisan — we just want to solve the problem, Schumer said. We want to get something done quickly and boldly. That's a big job, but we have to do it because the crisis is even bigger.\n\nBut Schumer says Democrats have a number of additional requests, including a vast expansion of unemployment insurance benefits.\n\nDemocrats want to provide a major increase in the amount of money provided through the federal unemployment assistance program — perhaps as high as an equal match to the salary lost. Schumer is also calling for that program to be extended for many months, along with expansions to paid sick and family leave. The president signed a package Wednesday night that included a first round of paid sick and family leave as well as help for jobless Americans, but lawmakers in both parties acknowledged that a broader effort is needed as the economic impact continues to worsen.\n\nHill Democrats also want limitations on any corporate bailouts or aid.\n\nIf they're going to do these corporate bailouts, we want to make sure they're for the average worker, Schumer said. We want to make sure they keep all of their workers without salary cuts. We want to make sure they don't use this money for stock buybacks.\n\nThe rapid developments come as lawmakers are growing increasingly concerned about the spread of the virus within the Capitol.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., informed members on Thursday that the House will not return to session until it is time to vote on a third coronavirus response bill.\n\nIn light of the guidance issued by the CDC, we will be adjusting the House schedule. It is my intention that the House will not return to session until we are in a position to vote on the third piece of emergency legislation to respond to the economic impact of this crisis, Hoyer said in a letter to House Democrats.\n\nRoughly nine lawmakers are under self-quarantine, and at least two have tested positive for COVID-19. While there is rising pressure among some rank-and-file members to allow remote voting, leaders have rejected those proposals.\n\nDozens of House lawmakers were already asking the chamber's leaders to allow remote voting before any members had tested positive. The effort was spearheaded by California Democratic Reps. Eric Swalwell and Katie Porter.\n\nCongress also should be no exception to the public health safeguards, they wrote in a March 18 letter to Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. We are undermining our unified, bipartisan message to the American people when we come together on a crowded House floor to vote.\n\nDuring a House chamber vote, more than 430 members and 100 staffers can be clustered on the floor, they said.\n\nIn all, 52 members signed the letter. Both Swalwell and Porter previously urged remote voting ahead of the health crisis, saying it should be an option to members regardless. However, the issue has taken on a new urgency with the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nHoyer acknowledged concerns about exposure in his letter to lawmakers and said he expected to adjust voting procedures. No decisions have been made on exactly what these changes will be, but we will be discussing all options, he wrote.\n\nAsked about members of Congress who had tested positive for the virus, President Trump said, I know all of them and said he hoped they all would recover. It's one of those things, he said, noting that most people recover.\n\nCongress would have to pass resolutions allowing remote voting, which would require either unanimous consent or an in-person vote. Either is a high bar, making the policy change unlikely at this moment.
Now What? 5 Looming Challenges For The Affordable Care Act\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Katherine Streeter for NPR Katherine Streeter for NPR\n\nRepublicans officially pulled the plug on their last-ditch effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act on Tuesday.\n\nWe don't have the votes, said Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., after a closed-door meeting of Senate Republicans. And since we don't have the votes, we've made the decision to postpone the vote. Cassidy, along with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., put together the proposal they hoped could pass the Senate.\n\nAs of Sunday, though, the Senate will no longer be able to pass a health law overhaul bill with only a simple majority. That means the bill is effectively dead, for now.\n\nThat message was underscored by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who said, Where we go from here is tax reform.\n\nBut that does not mean all is smooth sailing for the ACA. Here are five ongoing challenges the law faces.\n\n1. Insurers still face tremendous uncertainty.\n\nWednesday is the deadline for health insurers to finalize rates for the 2018 individual market open enrollment season, which starts Nov. 1. Yet there has been no resolution to the question of whether the federal government will continue to reimburse insurers for subsidies known as cost-sharing reductions. Those are payments insurers are required to provide to moderate-income enrollees to help them afford deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. The law says the federal government is supposed to make those payments, but a lawsuit has left that an open question, and the Trump administration has repeatedly threatened to stop making the payments.\n\nWithout reimbursement of those subsidies, Pennsylvania Health and Human Services Secretary Teresa Miller told the Senate Finance Committee Monday, insurers in her state reported they would need to request a statewide average increase of 20.3 percent in the cost of health plan premiums. Those increases are similar nationwide.\n\nA bipartisan effort led by Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., to advance legislation to affirmatively fund the payments was reportedly progressing until Republican leaders stopped them to concentrate on efforts to pass the Graham-Cassidy legislation.\n\nBut Alexander and Murray now appear back at it.\n\nMurray said Tuesday she is ready to keep working on the bipartisan path that could lead to results.\n\nAlexander similarly released a statement that he would consult with Murray and others on a limited bipartisan plan that could be enacted into law to help lower premiums and make insurance available to the 18 million Americans in the individual market in 2018 and 2019.\n\n2. The Trump administration has cut funding for efforts to sign people up for insurance.\n\nAdministration officials announced earlier this month major cuts to the navigator program, which provides funding to community groups that guide people through the complex task of signing up for health insurance through the online marketplaces. Some groups are losing more than 90 percent of their budgets.\n\nThe cuts have forced many groups to lay off workers just before open enrollment begins and to limit the areas they serve.\n\n3. The 2018 enrollment period is half the length of 2017's, and now it will be shorter still.\n\nTrump officials are also slashing by 90 percent the advertising budget that reminds people about open enrollment and how to sign up — from $100 million to $10 million.\n\nThose cuts are even more significant this year because for the first time since the law's implementation, open enrollment starts in November, rather than December, and lasts only 45 days.\n\nMost people don't know the open enrollment dates, and they don't know that the deadline this year is Dec. 15, not Jan. 31, like last year, wrote Lori Lodes, who ran outreach for the ACA in the Obama administration, in a recent op-ed for Vox.\n\nTrump administration officials said they don't think advertising is cost-effective, but Lodes wrote that my office produced reams of data that proved the overall effectiveness of outreach advertising.\n\nAdditionally, HHS announced late last week that it will shut down HealthCare.gov for maintenance from 12 a.m. to 12 p.m. every Sunday during open enrollment, except for Dec. 10 – a step critics say could further undermine enrollment efforts.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\n4. The Trump administration is dragging its feet on giving states flexibility to stabilize their markets.\n\nBack in March, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services chief Seema Verma, who oversees the ACA, sent a letter to states encouraging them to use the law's waiver process to improve the functioning of their individual insurance markets. In particular, they suggested states could create reinsurance programs that would help lower premiums by providing a payment mechanism for the most expensive patients.\n\nBut when Minnesota took up that invitation, the administration delayed its response. When it finally did grant permission last week, HHS also informed the state that it will lose significant funding for a program that provides insurance to the state's low-income residents.\n\nGov. Mark Dayton, a former Democratic senator, said in a letter to Price that we have now been informed that Minnesota would lose more federal Basic Health Plan funding than we would receive in federal support for reinsurance, and described the entire waiver process as nightmarish.\n\n5. Republicans could take another shot at a full overhaul next year — or even this year.\n\nWhile the acknowledgment that the GOP lacks the votes to overhaul the health law means an immediate vote will not happen, the Republicans have potentially two more shots to try to pass a bill with a simple majority vote.\n\nWhat triggers the ability to pass a bill in the Senate without threat of filibuster is a formal budget resolution. Republicans have still not passed a budget resolution for fiscal 2018, which begins Oct. 1. The upcoming resolution is expected to call for a major tax cut bill. Some Republicans, notably Graham himself, have suggested adding health language to that resolution, which would be allowed.\n\nBut that would complicate efforts for both bills.\n\nMore likely is that Republicans could try again for a health overhaul via its fiscal 2019 budget resolution, which is due next April. That would leave them only a few months before the 2018 elections. Still, it's possible, particularly if they can use the time to reach consensus.\n\nThat is clearly what sponsors of the latest GOP bill have in mind.\n\nWe're on a path to pass his bill, Graham told reporters. It's just a matter of when. It will be in this Congress, under a better process.\n\nKaiser Health News, a nonprofit health newsroom, is an editorially independent part of the Kaiser Family Foundation.
The 'Uncollected Stories' Show Allan Gurganus At His Finest\n\nThere aren't too many American authors for whom the publication of a new book is a bona fide literary event, but Allan Gurganus is one of them. The North Carolina author took the book world by storm in 1989 with his debut novel, Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All, which became a massive bestseller and spawned an Emmy-winning television miniseries adaptation. Only four books followed after that.\n\nUntil now. The Uncollected Stories of Allan Gurganus is his first book since 2013, and it's more than worth the wait. The collection is Gurganus at his finest: funny, compassionate, and marked by the author's amazing ability to reflect the lightness — and darkness — in the souls of his fascinating characters.\n\nThe collection kicks off with The Wish for a Good Young Country Doctor, which made something of a splash when it was originally published in The New Yorker last spring. The story is narrated by an antique collector reflecting on his days as an American studies graduate student; he was part of a band of merry hippie researchers and cerebral hucksters who frequented antique stores in the Midwest, delighting in every kitschy old toy they managed to dig up.\n\nAt one store, the student's eye is caught by a 19th-century painting, and he convinces the store's initially belligerent proprietor to tell him about the subject. It turns out to be a portrait of Fredrick M. Petrie, who arrived in a small town called La Verne at the same time as a cholera epidemic. [T]he doctor was soon the only person brave or fool enough to duck under the quarantine ropes, ignoring warning signs he himself had nailed to doors of those farmhouses worst hit, the store owner explains. Despite the doctor's help, the townspeople turn on him, blaming him for the wave of illnesses. In La Verne, if we act too kind or smart or interested in much, they'll make us pay. And pay. And pay, the shop owner says.\n\nThe collection is Gurganus at his finest: funny, compassionate, and marked by the author's amazing ability to reflect the lightness — and darkness — in the souls of his fascinating characters.\n\nIt's easy to see why the story resonated so much last year with readers who were just weeks into a pandemic of their very own. In 31 pages, Gurganus spotlights the best and worst in America: the selflessness of those who put their own lives in danger to help others, and the inexplicable mean-spiritedness they're too often subjected to in return. It's a story that hits way too close to home, and Gurganus tells it beautifully, with an underlying anger that nonetheless never turns to cynicism.\n\nMuch more hopeful is Unassisted Human Flight, which follows a reporter wrapping up his stint at a small-town North Carolina newspaper with one last big article: a story about an eight-year-old boy who, decades back, was carried by a tornado and left unharmed. The boy, now an engineer in his 40s, initially resists the reporter's entreaties to talk to him, reluctant to revisit the storm that killed his twin brother.\n\nBut the reporter persists, and eventually the man agrees to share his story. But wherever we wind up, in whatever amount, I think we'll exit riding some force to show us out, the engineer tells the reporter. Death is room-temperature. It has no mass but is a Fact. And nothing's out to torture us except certain other people. No hidden meanness is waiting to trap us.\n\nIt's a beautiful story that works chiefly because of Gurganus' gift for writing realistic, but still musical, dialogue. He gets the intonations of Southern speech just right, and never condescends to his small-town characters.\n\nThe standout story in the collection is Fetch, in which a narrator tells the story of witnessing a middle-aged couple taking their Labrador retriever to the beach. The woman appears gravely ill, with her partner helping her walk: How many months now has he slowed his gait to honor gravity's sudden tax on hers?\n\nAlthough the weather is inclement, the man throws a stick into the ocean for the dog to fetch, and it soon finds itself struggling to stay afloat, sending the couple into a panic: And you soon hear in their torn scraps of sound how they no longer simply tease or coax the animal ashore; theirs have become cries and screams ascending to the pitch of non-believers' prayers.\n\nIt's an astounding story (although one that will likely send any dog lovers reading it into a panic attack); Gurganus proves to be a master of pacing, recounting the dog's struggle in exacting, finely observed detail. Remarkably, he tells the story with no dialogue; the narrator only sees the couple communicating in gestures — it's a technique that somehow manages to amp up the tension of the story while still making clear the love the couple have for each other and for their beloved pet.\n\nAnd like all the stories in the collection, it's full of Gurganus' deep-seated compassion and fascination with — and love for — humanity. This is a remarkable book, and it proves once again why Gurganus is one of the country's most talented and imaginative writers. Coming after a year where nothing went right, and the world was forced to realize that things might not work out in the end, it's a hopeful tonic. As Gurganus writes, We grant ourselves so little daily hope. Meanwhile, barely noticing, we've already managed wonders.
The Census Bureau Needs To Hire Half A Million Workers For The 2020 Count\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Toby Talbot/AP Toby Talbot/AP\n\nWhile hundreds of thousands of federal workers were furloughed during the partial government shutdown, one federal agency was in the midst of a massive recruiting effort.\n\nThe Census Bureau has been busy trying to hire around a half million temporary workers to help carry out the upcoming national head count of every person living in the U.S. The census is set to officially kick off next January.\n\nFunding carried over from last year kept census preparations going through the 35-day shutdown that ended Jan. 25. That includes processing applications received through the bureau's 2020 census jobs website that launched last September and staffing up census offices that are starting to open this month in communities around the country.\n\nThe one thing that keeps me up at night is the one thing I have less control over, and that's our ability to recruit and hire, the Census Bureau's head of the 2020 census, Albert Fontenot, explained during a public meeting last year.\n\nCensus workers will play a critical role to make sure people who don't fill out a census form themselves by mail, phone or online get counted. Fewer than seven in 10 householders plan to take part in the census, according to a new report commissioned by the Census Bureau.\n\nThe rate is cause for concern because the decennial census is designed to count every person in the United States, wrote the report's researchers, noting that the actual response rate may be lower.\n\nA small applicant pool?\n\nDoor-to-door follow-up visits by census workers help make up the most expensive part of the 2020 census. The head count is expected to cost a total of $15.6 billion. But the visits have helped the agency ensure that as many residents in the U.S. as possible are counted accurately and at their usual addresses.\n\nThe low unemployment rate, however, could result in an applicant pool smaller than the bureau would like for its openings for door knockers and other census positions.\n\nAn earlier round of hiring beginning in 2016 for partnership specialists — charged with encouraging the hardest-to-count groups, including communities of color, to participate in the census — encountered smaller than expected applicant pools, declined offers, and turnover, according to a Government Accountability Office report released last year.\n\nFor last year's test run of the 2020 census in Rhode Island's Providence County, the bureau sent out into the field about 70 percent of the workers it planned to bring on.\n\nUsing smartphones to submit people's census information back to the bureau through the Internet did help boost the workers' productivity for the test run in Providence County. Still, Census Bureau officials say they plan to adapt their recruiting efforts for the actual head count.\n\nOnly hiring U.S. citizens?\n\nMore than 90,000 people have applied for 2020 census jobs through the bureau's website, and since late December, the agency has hired more than 680 workers. The bureau is expected to make a more high-profile push for job applicants through an advertising campaign set to launch in January 2020.\n\nCensus job postings have noted that U.S. citizenship is a requirement, as it is for most federal government positions. For past head counts, however, the Census Bureau has received exemptions to hire noncitizens with special language or cultural skills to serve as translators and in outreach positions.\n\nThere is not a ban on hiring noncitizens, the Census Bureau's public information office emphasized in a written statement from June. In a new statement, the agency says it's still pursuing all legal flexibilities provided by Congress to hire the workforce we will need to conduct an accurate 2020 Census.\n\nSo far, however, the bureau has only hired U.S. citizens for the upcoming head count.\n\nBridge job\n\nSome communities are doing their part in recruiting efforts by helping job seekers apply for census jobs. For now, many of the openings are for outreach specialists who work with local community groups, as well as for positions based in local and regional census offices.\n\nMarzena Ermler, the career services manager at the New York Public Library, says she has been recommending census positions as a bridge job for some job seekers.\n\nWe very often see a lot of mature job seekers who are transitioning from one career to another, explains Ermler, who is based at the Science, Industry and Business Library in Manhattan. They, for whatever reason, are laid off, other jobs are over, and they need that quick access to cash.\n\nPamela Hudson recently stopped by the Bronx Library Center to meet with a career coach who helped her complete an online job application for a supervisor position.\n\nCommunities like the Bronx, she says, need to be counted accurately so that they get their fair share of the hundreds of billions of federal tax dollars distributed based on census numbers.\n\nI'm thinking about transitioning into this job because it's very important to me, Hudson adds. We have children that need education. We have children that need health care.\n\nConcerns about census funding\n\nThe partial government shutdown, however, did give Hudson pause about working for the Census Bureau. She noticed the bureau was not updating portions of its website during the shutdown because of a lapse in federal funding, according to a banner splashed across the site.\n\nI'm concerned about that, Hudson says, wondering if census workers may not get paid if there's another funding stalemate.\n\nIn case there's another shutdown in the coming weeks, the bureau has said it has enough money to work on the 2020 census into April.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Hansi Lo Wang/NPR Hansi Lo Wang/NPR\n\nWhatever happens, Tayesha Hudson, no relation to Pamela, says she is not worried.\n\nI know eventually the government is going to have to get it together, and I know that they're going to want this 2020 census to go forward, she says.\n\nTayesha Hudson is interested in helping with door-knocking and collecting census information in the Bronx. If she is hired for the job, though, she expects to do a lot of persuading of community members who, she says, may not see the point of participating in the census.\n\nWe're all in this life just trying to make sure that we can go day by day, so we all should be counted.\n\nIt's about making sure that we get the things that we need in our community, that everybody is counted regardless of their race, regardless of whether or not they're a citizen, she says. We're all in this life just trying to make sure that we can go day by day, so we all should be counted.\n\nThe challenge of the citizenship question\n\nThe controversy over the citizenship question the Trump administration wants to add to the 2020 census could pose another challenge to recruiting and hiring. The question asks, Is this person a citizen of the United States?\n\nA federal judge in New York, who presided over the two lead lawsuits about the question, has ordered the administration to stop plans to include it on forms for the head count. But the administration – which is facing five other citizenship question lawsuits — wants the Supreme Court to let the question stay.\n\nIf it does, many census workers will have a harder job, says Elzie Wright, a program coordinator for the Christopher Rose Community Empowerment Campaign, based in Brooklyn.\n\nThey know that they probably won't get too many answers or too many participants, especially now in this environment, explains Wright, who has worked on outreach to the Haitian community in Brooklyn. Let's face it: There's a lot of undocumented people in the community. And that makes them suspicious to talk to anybody.\n\nThe Census Bureau is expecting fewer households to respond to the census if there is a citizenship question. It plans to use results from an upcoming field test of people's responses to the question to update its recruiting strategy as the head count draws closer.\n\nThat means the bureau could have to hire even more workers.
Walmart Joins Dick's Sporting Goods In Tighter Limits On Gun Sales\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 7:40 p.m. ET\n\nWalmart and Dick's Sporting Goods say they won't sell guns to customers under 21, and both are putting new restrictions on ammunition sales.\n\nDick's Sporting Goods, one of the largest sports retailers in the U.S., has announced it is immediately ending its sales of military-style semi-automatic rifles and is requiring all customers to be older than 21 to buy a firearm at its stores. Additionally, the company no longer will sell high-capacity magazines.\n\nWalmart, which ended sales of modern sporting rifles such as AR-15s in 2015, has announced that it is raising the minimum age for purchasing firearms and ammunition from 18 to 21. The company notes that it does not sell bump stocks, high-capacity magazines and similar accessories.\n\nWalmart is also removing items from its website resembling assault-style rifles, including nonlethal airsoft guns and toys — like the air gun Tamir Rice was playing with when he was shot by a Cleveland police officer who thought the 12-year-old was armed.\n\nDick's Sporting Goods CEO Ed Stack announced the firm's decision on ABC's Good Morning America on Wednesday, the same day that survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School returned to class. Stack said the 19-year-old gunman allegedly behind that massacre, which claimed 17 lives and wounded many more in Parkland, Fla., had purchased a firearm from the retailer last November.\n\nWhile that the weapon — a shotgun — was not used in the shooting, the CEO said the revelation deeply affected Stack and his colleagues at Dick's.\n\nWe did everything by the book. We did everything that the law required, and still he was able to buy a gun, Stack said. When we looked at that, we said the systems that are in place across the board just aren't effective enough to keep us from selling a gun like that.\n\nAnd so we've decided we're not going to sell the assault-type rifles any longer.\n\nThe company, which operates more than 715 locations, already had pulled assault-style weapons from Dick's stores after the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting; now it will also stop selling the weapons at its subsidiary Field & Stream stores.\n\nStack said the decision to eliminate assault-style rifles is permanent.\n\nOur thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims and their loved ones, the company said in a statement issued Wednesday. But thoughts and prayers are not enough. We have tremendous respect and admiration for the students organizing and making their voices heard regarding gun violence in schools and elsewhere in our country.\n\nWe have heard you. The nation has heard you. ... The systems in place are not effective to protect our kids and our citizens.\n\nThe statement asserted the company's support for the Second Amendment but continued, we have to help solve the problem that's in front of us. Gun violence is an epidemic.\n\nIn addition to changing its own policies, the company issued a plea to elected officials to enact common-sense gun reform, specifically calling for the following regulations:\n\nBan assault-style firearms\n\nRaise the minimum age to purchase firearms to 21\n\nBan high-capacity magazines, as well as bump stocks — gun accessories that allow semi-automatic rifles to operate like fully automatic weapons\n\nRequire universal background checks that include relevant mental health information and previous interactions with the law\n\nEnsure a complete universal database of those banned from buying firearms\n\nClose the private sale and gun show loopholes that waive background checks\n\nWith their moves, Dick's and Walmart join a host of major companies that made changes in reaction to the Parkland shooting. As NPR's Amy Held reported last week, many other high-profile companies — from MetLife Insurance and First National Bank of Omaha to Symantec and Hertz — have ended their corporate partnerships with the National Rifle Association.\n\nThose moves have not been without controversy.\n\nEarlier this week, for instance, Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle threatened to kill any tax legislation that benefits Delta Air Lines after the company ended its own relationship with the NRA. Delta, which is based in Atlanta, had announced two days earlier that we will be requesting that the NRA remove our information from their website — a decision Cagle described as an attack on conservatives.\n\nAsked about the potential for pushback among gun rights advocates, Stack acknowledged the move isn't going to make everyone happy. But when we look at what those kids and the parents and the heroes in the school, what they did, our view was: If the kids can be brave enough to organize like this, we can be brave enough to get these [firearms] out of here.\n\nWe're staunch supporters of the Second Amendment, he added. I'm a gun owner myself. We've just decided that based on what's happened and with these guns, we don't want to be part of this story.
FACT CHECK: Trump's Tweets On Christians, ISIS And Vetting Miss The Bigger Picture\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mohammed Zaatari/AP Mohammed Zaatari/AP\n\nHundreds were detained at airports around the country Saturday in a chaotic and confusing day following President Trump's Friday night executive order temporarily banning Muslims from seven countries.\n\nIt spurred protests and backlash — even from some in Trump's own party, for either mismanagement of the rollout of the order or the values it represents.\n\nBut one thing Trump's executive order did — and why many are referring to it as a Muslim ban — is indicate a carve-out for Christians. Here's the controversial language:\n\nTrump hinted that he would be prioritizing Christians before the order was released on Friday. Here's the transcript of Trump's exchange with the Christian Broadcasting Network's David Brody:\n\nBRODY: Persecuted Christians, we've talked about this, the refugees overseas. The refugee program, or the refugee changes you're looking to make. As it relates to persecuted Christians, do you see them as kind of a priority here? TRUMP: Yes. BRODY: You do? TRUMP: They've been horribly treated. Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair. So we are going to help them.\n\nIt's true that 99 percent of the 12,587 refugees from Syria admitted in 2016 to the U.S. were Muslim and less than 1 percent were Christian. That would outpace Muslims' population in Syria, which is 93 percent. But that's based on 2010 numbers. With the civil war going on and the millions who have been displaced, it's nearly impossible to tell exactly what the most current percentages are.\n\nAnother possible reason for the lower percentage of Christians being admitted from Syria to the U.S. is the protection they have received from the Assad regime.\n\nAs the Christian Post reported in 2015:\n\nChristians, who have been caught in the crossfire of the Arab Spring and civil war, have found a measure of protection under Assad's dictatorship.In October, the Catholic Herald reported on comments from one of Syria's leading Christians who said [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's intervention, while possibly motivated by selfish reasons, is helping and giving hope to Christians.\n\nWhy would Assad do that? His regime loves to paint itself as a protector of minorities, and there are still a large number of Christians in the Syrian capital of Damascus, for example, where Assad's government is centered.\n\nWhat's more, if the implication is that the U.S. is not admitting Christian refugees or that the U.S. is making it difficult, that's not true at all. In fact, the number of Christian refugees to the U.S. in 2016 was almost equal to that of Muslim refugees — 37,521 to 38,901, according to the Pew Research Center, which is basing its numbers on figures from the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nTrump took to Twitter Sunday morning to defend himself on the need to prioritize Christians. He said they were being executed in large numbers, reiterated his call for extreme vetting and warned of the U.S. turning into Europe, which has dealt with terrorist attacks and bombings since the rise of ISIS:\n\nThe Obama administration did formally accuse ISIS of carrying out a genocide against religious minorities, including Christians in Iraq and Syria. Offices at the State Department have been involved in the U.S. response, though this did not include putting Christians at the top of the line for the U.S. resettlement program.\n\nBut here's the reality: While Christians in Iraq and Syria have been killed by ISIS, Muslims have been the group's victims far more frequently and represent the strong majority. Shiite Muslims are killed by ongoing waves of ISIS bombings of Shiite neighborhoods, and Shiite members of Iraq's security forces have been victims of mass ISIS executions.\n\nBut even as ISIS claims it fights for Sunni Islam, fellow Sunni Muslims have also been killed and displaced in greater numbers than Christians. That is in part because ISIS operates mostly in Sunni areas. Hundreds of thousands of Sunnis have been displaced from ISIS areas, as Sunnis, who try to oppose the group or have ties to the Iraqi government, are targeted.\n\nAnd Muslims have fought ISIS more than anyone else. This includes Kurdish Sunnis and Arab Sunnis and Shiites, who are on the front lines and often allied with U.S. advisers in the battle against ISIS, as well as Turkmen Muslims. Some of the most horrific videos from ISIS have shown the killing of Sunni Muslims who have fought the group, like a Jordanian pilot and Turkish troops shown burned alive.\n\nCertainly, it's the case that Christians were terrified of ISIS and fled. ISIS has desecrated churches and shrines. Some Christians have lived in ISIS-controlled areas and paid a tax to the terrorist group. And there have been Christians killed and kidnapped — 88 Eritrean Christians from Libya who were kidnapped by ISIS in 2015 two months after 28 Ethiopian Christians were executed; 262 Assyrian Christians kidnapped from the Tel Tamer area in Syria and held for ransom; 50 killed in Tel Tamer in suicide bombings.\n\nBut that pales in comparison with the mass murder of Muslims — massacres in Iraq; 1,700 Iraqi air force cadets executed or missing from Camp Speicher, a former American military base near Tikrit; the slaughter of hundreds of the al-Sheitat tribe in Syria; and the massacre of Syrian army POWs at Tabqa in 2014.\n\nThat's not to mention the hunting down of Yazidis.\n\nAs far as Europe goes, there is an ocean between the U.S. and Europe, and the U.S. already has very strict procedures in place for refugees, as NPR's Brian Naylor has reported.\n\nNPR's Jane Arraf also contributed to this post.
President-Elect Trump Breaks With Long History Of Press Conferences\n\nWe've created this handy widget to track how long it has been since Donald Trump held a formal press conference and how many times he has tweeted in that time. It will keep counting until he holds one.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nWhy are we tracking this?\n\nUnlike other ways of getting messages out, press conferences hold public officials more accountable to the American people because they have to answer questions in an uncontrolled environment.\n\nThe public expects that a president isn't just going to announce something [but] that he's going to explain it and be able to answer questions about it, said Martha Joynt Kumar, a political scientist at Towson University and director of the White House Transition Project.\n\nFor the second time as president-elect, Trump tweeted an announcement of a scheduled press conference, this time on Jan. 11.\n\nInitially, Dec. 15 was to be the day Trump would hold his first press conference since winning the election. But it never happened, canceled before a time and place had been set. It was supposed to be about how Trump would address his potential business conflicts of interest as president. The rescheduled press conference has no such promised focus.\n\nAlready, no president-elect (dating to at least Jimmy Carter) has waited longer to hold a press conference. One irony — perhaps hypocrisy — of Trump's extended run without a press conference is just how critical he and his campaign were of rival Hillary Clinton's choice to go an extended period (276 days in total) without holding one. His campaign sent out daily press releases counting the days since her last press conference, headlined, Hiding Hillary Watch — and, at one point, Trump even tweeted about it:\n\nI am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2016\n\nUnless Trump holds a press conference by Jan. 21, one day after his inauguration, he will hit the very mark for which he ridiculed Clinton on Twitter.\n\nPrecedent favors frequent press conferences during transition\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nTwo days after the Supreme Court decision that made George W. Bush president-elect in 2000, he held a press conference in Austin. He took questions from reporters about his potential Cabinet picks, whether he would call for tax cuts and when the weight of being the next president of the United States hit him.\n\nThe next day, Bush introduced his choice for secretary of state and took more questions. The day after that, he answered yet more questions during a press conference to introduce his national security adviser and White House counselors.\n\nPresident-elect Barack Obama followed a similar pattern, regularly fielding questions from reporters, as he made choices about who would serve in his administration. In all, Obama fielded questions from the White House press corps on 18 different occasions as president-elect. George W. Bush, who had a shorter transition period, did so 11 times.\n\nAt this point, if president-elect Donald Trump were to hold a press conference every day starting today, he wouldn't hit Obama's mark for formal interactions with the press during the transition period.\n\nAs with so many other things, Trump is flouting this tradition. He hasn't held a press conference since July 27, when he called on Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's emails. I will tell you this, Russia: If you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, Trump said at his resort in Doral, Fla. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Seth Wenig/AP Seth Wenig/AP\n\nInstead Trump has opted for rallies, press releases, photo ops, a handful of interviews and tweeting. Lots of tweeting.\n\nOn the day he announced his choice for secretary of state, Trump tweeted praise for his pick, Rex Tillerson, the chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil, but didn't appear with him publicly. Trump did go down to the lobby of Trump Tower so he could be photographed with rapper Kanye West.\n\nLife, Trump said when asked what they talked about. We discussed life.\n\nLater, he held a victory rally in Wisconsin.\n\nThe first presidential press conference happened by accident\n\nWhen an aide to President Woodrow Wilson invited newspapermen to meet the new president in 1913, the presidential press conference was born.\n\nHe wasn't expecting so many newsmen to show up. But since then, it has become a tradition, a fixture of the relationship between the president, the press and, by extension, the American public.\n\nBased on an NPR analysis of data from the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara over the past three administrations, the president has fielded questions from reporters on average about every 15 days.\n\nCBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller, who meticulously tracks the activities of the president, says the longest drought between press conferences for President George W. Bush was 82 days, while the longest President Obama went without a press conference was 86.\n\nBut the traditions of the relationship between the president and the press don't appear to be a driving motivator for Trump and his transition team.\n\nAppearing on the Hugh Hewitt radio show, Trump's future White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said things like the weekly radio address, or even the daily briefing by the press secretary — where members of the media are allowed to question the administration on policy and topics of the day — could change under Trump.\n\nThe traditions, while some of them are great, Priebus said, I think it's time to revisit a lot of these things that have been done in the White House, and I can assure you that change is going to happen.
First Mention: Donald Trump Unveils Trump Tower In 1983\n\nWe find a first mention of Donald Trump deep in the NPR archives from the opening of Trump Tower in 1983.\n\nKELLY MCEVERS, HOST:\n\nLet's take a look into NPR's audio archives. It is where we go for something we like to call...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: First mention.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nThat's when we locate, to the best of our ability, the moment when a well-known thing or person first showed up on NPR. Lately, we've been discovering when the current presidential candidates appeared. Today, it's Donald Trump.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nBOB EDWARDS, BYLINE: And this is NPR's MORNING EDITION.\n\nMCEVERS: On NPR's MORNING EDITION on April 25, 1983 - yes, that was the 1983 version of the theme song - reporter Todd Shapira was covering the opening of a skyscraper in New York City.\n\nTODD SHAPIRA, BYLINE: When you enter Trump Tower under the bronze portal on 5th Avenue, you're greeted by a polished doorman.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Good morning, dear lady.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Good morning.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Very lovely lady there, isn't she?\n\nSHAPIRA: The lavish shopping atrium inside will feature expensive boutiques from international designers.\n\nMCEVERS: Our reporter got a tour. He did not get to speak to Donald Trump, but he did talk at length about him.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nSHAPIRA: Also moving in is the building's namesake, 37-year-old whiz kid developer Donald Trump. Trump is on his way to building himself a real estate empire in New York, but not without controversy. In 1973, the developer was sued by the Justice Department for refusing to rent to blacks. Trump is also known for making lucrative deals with New York state and for making massive political contribution. Now, Trump is fighting the city for a $50 million tax abatement for his tower, saying this Kasbah for sheiks and movie stars will provide a public benefit because it's a mixed-use building with boutiques and office space. The city has twice ruled against tax abatements for Trump Tower. Trump responded by suing the housing commissioner for $138 million.\n\nMCEVERS: By the way, Trump did settle that racial bias case brought by the Justice Department, but did not admit any wrongdoing.\n\nCORNISH: NPR listeners would then have to wait two years before they got to hear directly from the future reality show star and presidential candidate. It came in a story about quarterback Doug Flutie joining the New Jersey Generals.\n\nMCEVERS: The Generals were a short-lived team for a short-lived league called the United States Football League. It was like an alternative to the NFL. Trump used to own the Generals. And when he hired Flutie, MORNING EDITION aired this story by reporter Jon Kalish on February 6, 1985.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nJON KALISH, BYLINE: It was Donald Trump, the wealthy New York builder and owner of the Generals, who first compared Flutie to Joe Namath. There are some who believe Trump has acquired players like Flutie and running back Hershel Walker to aid the USFL's anti-trust suit against the NFL. One sports columnist described Trump's motivation this way - Donald Trump knows the only way for the NFL to accept Donald Trump is for the Generals to have players the NFL needs. In any event, Trump says Flutie is good for his team and the league.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Doug gives tremendous credibility to the league. Ticket sales are going through the roof, and I'm not only talking about our team. I'm talking about many of the teams. Most of the teams were way up, and that's great. And that's largely attributable to Doug and to the league itself.\n\nCORNISH: Donald Trump in 1985, being heard on NPR for the first time.\n\nMCEVERS: Incidentally, the New Jersey Generals only played three seasons. And the whole United States Football League fell apart a year after that story.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

Trump Stands By Unproven Wiretap Claim At Joint News Conference With Merkel\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 4:50 p.m. ET\n\nAt a wide-ranging and occasionally tense news conference after their first in-person meeting Friday, President Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed trade and border policy — and had one notable exchange when Trump was asked about his unproven claims that former President Obama tapped the phones at Trump Tower last year.\n\nTrump declined the opportunity to retract the claim, telling the media that we said nothing when he tweeted, How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process, and that he was merely quoting a very talented legal mind he had seen on Fox News.\n\nYou should be talking to Fox, Trump said.\n\nAfter the conference, Fox's Shepard Smith responded: Fox News cannot confirm Judge Napolitano's commentary, apparently referring to the report Trump cited.\n\nBut first, when addressing the question about wiretapping from a German reporter, Trump told Merkel: At least we have something in common, perhaps — making an implied reference to the 2013 revelations that the National Security Administration had spied on European leaders, including Merkel.\n\nMerkel did not reply.\n\nThe moment punctuated remarks that focused predominantly on trade and training the countries' workers for manufacturing in the 21st century. In his statement at the start, Trump praised Germany's apprenticeship program that trains people to join the industrial workforce.\n\nHe also took a moment to thank Merkel for Germany's continued support of the war effort in Afghanistan and for its role as a counter-ISIS coalition member.\n\nStill, while Trump said he reiterated to Merkel his strong support for NATO, he was also careful to emphasize that NATO allies need to pay their fair share for the cost of defense. It's a point he has repeated often, maintaining a skeptical view of the defensive alliance — a position that has made Germany and other European countries wary.\n\nMany nations owe vast sums of money from past years, and it is very unfair to the United States, Trump continued. These nations must pay what they owe.\n\nToward that end, both leaders said that Germany is committed to increasing its defense spending to 2 percent of its GDP — a goal already established for NATO members by the treaty's terms.\n\nMerkel, for her part, focused on business from the outset as a centerpiece of her visit. Indeed she embarked on her trans-Atlantic trip with some notable companions: top executives at BMW, Siemens and the industrial parts manufacturer Schaeffler.\n\nHer high-placed company sent as good a message as any about the direction Merkel expected these introductory talks to take.\n\nShe wants to make the point that the companies have created thousands of jobs in the United States, Tanit Koch, the editor of the German newspaper Bild, tells NPR's Rachel Martin.\n\nCiting Merkel's interview with another German paper, Saarbruecker Zeitung, the BBC says the chancellor planned to remind Trump that BMW's plant in South Carolina exported more cars than GM and Ford together from America.\n\nI'll make that clear, Merkel added.\n\nAnd unavoidably with business comes the question of trade. At the news conference, Merkel praised international trade agreements, saying they work best when they work as a win-win for the parties involved.\n\nThe English word she puts a lot of emphasis on right now is the word 'reciprocity,'  Koch says.\n\nYet the German publication Deutsche Welle points out that the bar of what to expect from their first meeting [is] rather low, especially given the prior verbal tiffs between them and their different domestic audiences.\n\nAnd those prior verbal tiffs are not insignificant.\n\nBoth as a candidate and as president-elect, Trump had some harsh words for the German leader, saying she was ruining Germany and had made a catastrophic mistake in welcoming more than 1 million migrants and refugees in recent years.\n\nIt's always better to talk with each other than about each other.\n\nThe stark difference between their immigration policies surfaced again occasionally in the course of their news conference — with Trump pointedly asserting that immigration is a privilege, not a right.\n\nIn turn, Merkel maintained that while efforts must be made to stop illegal trafficking, such efforts have to be done by looking at the refugees as well, giving them opportunities to shape their own lives. ... Help countries who right now are not [able] to do so.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump stressed this difference in beliefs in harsh terms, once saying, The German people are going to end up overthrowing this woman. I don't know what the hell she's thinking.\n\nAnd shortly after Trump's election, Merkel offered a rebuttal of her own in a tepid note of congratulations, taking the opportunity to state:\n\nGermany and America are bound by their values: democracy, freedom, the respect for the law and the dignity of human beings, independent of their origin, skin colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political position. On the basis of these values I offer the future president of the United States, Donald Trump, close co-operation.\n\nThe tensions have made for a tenuous balance for both leaders — perhaps more so for the German chancellor, who faces a tough national election of her own in September.\n\nWhat we know from the polls — as much as we can trust them nowadays — is that you have 80 to 90 percent of Germans saying they pretty much abhor what [Trump is] doing, Koch tells NPR.\n\nBut Merkel can't fully separate herself from the U.S. president. Quite the opposite, in fact: Hopes remain that the meeting, if nothing else, might help reset the relationship between the two leaders.\n\nOr as Merkel told Saarbruecker Zeitung: It's always better to talk with each other than about each other.\n\nThey are likely to have at least one more opportunity to talk with each other after this visit. Trump has accepted Merkel's invitation to the G-20 Summit, which will be held in Germany this summer.
NRA Plans Layoffs, 20% Cut In Pay For Employees Due To Coronavirus' Economic Hit\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP\n\nFeeling the economic pain of the coronavirus pandemic, the National Rifle Association is planning to lay off staff and taking other cost-cutting measures in the face of extraordinary challenges from COVID-19, Wayne LaPierre, the chief executive of the NRA, announced to the group's board of directors on Monday.\n\nThe belt-tightening in response to the virus outbreak includes the elimination of certain positions and forcing hourly employees to work just four days a week, in addition to 20% reductions in pay for NRA staffers.\n\nIn addition, some senior staff members are voluntarily taking deeper cuts, said an NRA spokesman by email.\n\nA pay reduction is expected for LaPierre, but it is unclear by how much.\n\nLaPierre was paid $2.1 million in 2018, according to the nonprofit's more recent publicly filed tax filing.\n\nLeaked internal documents published last year detailing lavish six-figure spending on clothing and travel expenses for LaPierre prompted calls for his resignation from some of the group's now-former board members. Nonetheless, LaPierre remained the group's leader.\n\nNews about the NRA's salary cuts and other steps taken to cut slash costs at the influential gun rights group was first reported by Newsweek.\n\nThe NRA had already canceled its annual meeting, set to take place in Nashville, Tenn., because of the coronavirus.\n\nThis is in addition to the cancellation of numerous scheduled NRA programs and the competitions, an NRA spokesman said on Tuesday.\n\nWe believe these actions will favorably position the Association leading up to the November election. We will continue to lead the fight to protect our Second Amendment, the First Amendment, and all our constitutional freedoms for years to come, the statement read.\n\nThe NRA employed 816 people in 2018, according to the group's tax filing.\n\nAcross the country, firearms and ammunition dealers have reported surging sales amid pandemic fears, with many buyers saying looming uncertainty tied to the crisis spurred them to arm themselves and others citing a reduction in law enforcement activity in explaining their purchases.\n\nCritics of the NRA seized on the group's financial woes, arguing that the economic hard times were driven by more than the coronavirus.\n\nShannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a gun control advocacy group, said in a statement to NPR that years of apparent self-dealing by NRA insiders and an agenda that is out of step with the American public could be a factor in the NRA's downsizing.\n\nI offer NRA leaders my thoughts and prayers as our organization prepares to outspend and outwork them yet again this election season, Watts said.\n\nAn NRA spokesman hasn't responded to a request for comment on Watts' allegation.
News Brief: Election Results, Stock Markets Drop, Gene-Editing Tool\n\nAfter Super Tuesday, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are the front-runners. U.S. financial markets fell again on concerns over the coronavirus outbreak. And, details of a new development in medicine.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nIt is far from a done deal, but this morning after Super Tuesday, we're a lot closer to knowing who the 2020 Democratic nominee for president will be.\n\nNOEL KING, HOST:\n\nRemember; this started out as the most diverse field of Democratic presidential candidates in history. The front-runners now are two white men in their 70s, both with long political careers - Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOE BIDEN: Just a few days ago, the press and the pundits had declared the campaign dead.\n\n(BOOING)\n\nBIDEN: And then came South Carolina, and they had something to say about it.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nBIDEN: And we were told, well, when you got to Super Tuesday, it'd be over. Well, it may be over for the other guy.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Cheering).\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBERNIE SANDERS: Tonight, I tell you with absolute confidence, we are going to win the Democratic nomination.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nMARTIN: The voices of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders after last night's contests. We've got NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson with us to clarify what has happened and what it means going forward. Hi, Mara.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there.\n\nMARTIN: So it was a late night for all of us as we watched these returns come in. Big headline is that Joe Biden needed to do well. And he did, right?\n\nLIASSON: Yes, he did. The big question going in was, would Bernie Sanders end the night on a glide path to a plurality of delegates with an all-but-insurmountable lead? We came out of the night with Biden with the most votes and delegates so far, and maybe he's on track to get a plurality before the convention. The race is now a two-man fight for delegates.\n\nYesterday was a test of three things - money, momentum and movement or organization. It turns out money didn't mean so much. Bloomberg spent a ton of it and didn't do very well. In terms of movement and organization, well, Bernie Sanders had that in spades. Joe Biden only had one field office in California...\n\nMARTIN: Right.\n\nLIASSON: ...And one in Virginia. In some places, he didn't even campaign. It turns out that free media - earned media - momentum really mattered. And that's what Joe Biden had. He had endorsements, and it translated into wins. Who would've thunk it?\n\nMARTIN: Right.\n\nLIASSON: You know? Historical rules only work till they stop working.\n\nMARTIN: Until they don't work anymore.\n\nLIASSON: That's what we learned last night.\n\nMARTIN: (Laughter) Right. So we should just point out, we hear a lot about the fact that Bernie Sanders took California; Joe Biden came out on top of Texas - two very delegate-rich states. But it doesn't mean that each of those candidates walks away with all those delegates, right?\n\nLIASSON: No, because it's not a winner-take-all system the way the Republicans have. There's a 15% threshold. You don't get any delegates unless you get over 15% of the popular vote. If no one else gets 15%, then you can take all the delegates or a huge amount of the delegates - a bigger percentage of the delegates than the percentage of the popular vote that you got. But if a lot of other candidates get over 15%, then the winner of the state ends up taking a smaller percentage of the delegates than the percentage they got of the popular vote. That's why it's very important to see the final delegate totals.\n\nMARTIN: Right.\n\nLIASSON: We don't have those yet. But if you win big, you get more delegates than if you win by a smaller margin.\n\nMARTIN: All right. So let's talk about Elizabeth Warren, who did not have a good night. She really needed to do well or at least have a showing, right?\n\nLIASSON: Needed to do well. She came in third in her own home state of Massachusetts. She lost this place she was born, Oklahoma. And then, of course, that follows her fourth-place finish in the neighboring state of New Hampshire. But last night, she did not give any indication of giving up. Here's what she said.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nELIZABETH WARREN: No matter how scared you are, no matter how hard it looks, you get out there, and you fight for the people you love.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nLIASSON: So what Elizabeth Warren is going to do next is the subject of a lot of speculation. She had talked earlier about maybe a brokered convention; that was her path to the nomination.\n\nMARTIN: Yeah.\n\nLIASSON: But now she's splitting the left lane of the party with Bernie Sanders. Is that what she wants? Or will she drop out and endorse him? No one knows.\n\nMARTIN: All right. Let's finish on Mike Bloomberg because this is the first time he actually appeared on any ballot. He has spent an enormous amount of money. He only took American Samoa, a territory, last night. So what happens to his campaign moving forward?\n\nLIASSON: Well, he's reassessing his campaign. But even if he doesn't continue as a candidate, he is still on track to play what could be a game-changing and historic role in the election because he has said he will spend whatever it takes - billions of dollars if necessary - to support whoever is the nominee of the party. And he'll fund down-ballot Democratic candidates. He'll fund get-out-the-vote drives. He'll fund everything. That's what he says he'll do. And that is pretty significant.\n\nMARTIN: All right. NPR's Mara Liasson on the results of Super Tuesday. Mara, thank you.\n\nLIASSON: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMARTIN: OK. The World Health Organization says that the death rate of COVID-19, which is the disease caused by the coronavirus - that death rate is now at about 3.4%, which is higher than previously thought. The battle against coronavirus is really happening on a lot of different fronts, including at the Federal Reserve.\n\nKING: Yeah. That's right. The Fed made an emergency interest rate cut yesterday to try to protect the economy from the effects of the virus, but it didn't seem to work. The S&P, the Dow and the Nasdaq all fell yesterday anyway.\n\nMARTIN: We've got NPR chief economics correspondent Scott Horsley with us this morning. So Scott, just start with what was supposed to happen. What was the intention of the Fed in making this rate cut?\n\nSCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The Fed was hoping to inject some confidence in the economy and the stock market after the worst week on Wall Street since the financial crisis. This was the first time the Fed had cut rates outside of an ordinarily scheduled meeting. And they cut by half a point, not a quarter point as they usually do. They don't have a whole lot of monetary ammunition here, so they wanted to act quickly and dramatically even though Fed Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged that this action on its own would not shield the economy from coronavirus damage.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJEROME POWELL: We do recognize that a rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection. It won't fix a broken supply chain. We get that. We don't think we have all the answers. But we do believe that our action will provide a meaningful boost to the economy.\n\nHORSLEY: The initial reaction in the stock market was positive. The Dow jumped about 300 points when the news first broke. But the more investors thought about it, the less they liked it. And the major indexes ended the day down around 3%.\n\nMARTIN: Right. So what went wrong? I mean, how did he miscalculate?\n\nHORSLEY: Well, it is odd because just a day earlier, the market had jumped 4 to 5% on the promise of just this kind of rate cut. So it's a little bit unusual. I spoke to the chief economist at LendingTree, Tendayi Kapfidze. And he just thinks the Fed missed the mark. This is not the kind of medicine the economy needs to deal with the coronavirus epidemic.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)\n\nTENDAYI KAPFIDZE: I don't see that a rate cut makes me want to get on a plane or go to a sports stadium or any other kind of economic activity that increases my risk of infections.\n\nHORSLEY: Now, futures markets are pointing to the possibility of a rebound on Wall Street today, so there may be some reassessment. Although that may also reflect investors' attitudes about yesterday's Super Tuesday results.\n\nMARTIN: Right. So as you have pointed out, there are limits to what monetary policy can do when it comes to something like a public health crisis like the coronavirus. Is there another option for governments to employ?\n\nHORSLEY: There is. For example, South Korea is asking for just money to help businesses that are adversely affected by the epidemic. President Trump has been talking about a payroll tax holiday, which was something that was done during the recession. But there's been little follow-up on that from the White House and almost no talk about it on Capitol Hill.\n\nMARTIN: NPR's Scott Horsley for us. Thank you, Scott. We appreciate it.\n\nHORSLEY: You're welcome.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMARTIN: And now some news from the world of medicine.\n\nKING: Yeah. For the first time ever, doctors have used a revolutionary gene-editing technique. They're trying to treat a patient by editing that patient's DNA while it is still inside the person's body.\n\nMARTIN: We've got NPR health correspondent Rob Stein with us to explain. Hi, Rob.\n\nROB STEIN, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel.\n\nMARTIN: This sounds crazy. Scientists edited someone's DNA from inside their body.\n\nSTEIN: Yeah.\n\nMARTIN: Explain. What does that mean?\n\nSTEIN: Yeah. Well, they have literally genetically modified someone from the inside. And here's what I mean. Scientists - you know, they've been using a tool called CRISPR to rewrite the genetic code, you know, to try to treat diseases like cancer and sickle cell.\n\nMARTIN: Yeah.\n\nSTEIN: But until now, doctors have been taking cells out of the bodies - you know, cells like bone marrow cells - editing the DNA in the cells and then infusing the genetically modified cells back in.\n\nMARTIN: Right.\n\nSTEIN: Now, for the first time, they've tried this entirely new strategy to try to treat someone with a rare genetic disease that destroys their vision.\n\nMARTIN: That is amazing. So what happened? I mean, can you explain in layman's terms what they did?\n\nSTEIN: Yeah, yeah. It's really fascinating. You know, a surgeon cut a tiny hole in the patient's eye and then dripped in three tiny, little drops of liquid containing billions of harmless viruses that were genetically engineered to carry the genetic instructions for creating this CRISPR gene-editing tool inside the retina. The CRISPR then hopefully cut out the genetic defect that's causing the disease, letting the cells produce a crucial protein that will hopefully heal the sick cells in the retina and giving the patient the ability to see. Here's Eric Pierce. He's the Harvard doctor running this study.\n\nERIC PIERCE: If we can fix the underlying genetic defect, we have the potential to restore vision to people who never had normal vision before. It would indeed be amazing.\n\nMARTIN: That's phenomenal. So this is a person who couldn't see - hopefully that their vision is going to be restored. What happens now, Rob?\n\nSTEIN: They just did this procedure at the Casey Eye Institute. It's at the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland. And it's on the first volunteer, first study that's testing this. So the first thing the doctors and the scientists are looking for is, you know, whether it's safe. Remember; you know, nothing like this has ever been done before. So they're starting with a very low dose in an older patient who already had extensive vision damage. And they're only treating one eye. And this is all, you know, just to make sure it doesn't backfire somehow, end up destroying whatever vision they do have instead of helping them.\n\nMARTIN: Yeah.\n\nSTEIN: But the scientists say this patient could start to see better within, you know, maybe just a few weeks. So doctors are going to be watching really closely both for any problems and for any improvements before trying this on more patients.\n\nMARTIN: And obviously paying attention because if it works, I assume it's going to have effects, implications for other diseases, right?\n\nSTEIN: Yeah. That's right. That's one of the reasons scientists are so excited about this. You know, there are many other diseases where you really can't treat them by taking cells out of their body and editing them and putting them back in. And the only way to get to the cells that need to be fixed, you know, for brain diseases like Huntington's disease, maybe some inherited forms of dementia, muscle diseases like muscular dystrophy, is to edit from the inside instead of from the outside.\n\nMARTIN: Yeah.\n\nSTEIN: This is what Francis Collins of the National Institutes of Health said about all this.\n\nFRANCIS COLLINS: All of us dream of what time might be coming, where we could apply this approach for thousands of diseases.\n\nSTEIN: He said it's really exciting, and he's looking forward to see what happens next.\n\nMARTIN: Wow. The implications could be huge. NPR's Rob Stein for us this morning. Thank you, Rob. We appreciate it.\n\nSTEIN: No problem.\n\n[POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In this report, we incorrectly say that the Federal Reserve cut rates this week for the first time outside of a scheduled meeting. In fact, it was the first time since the financial crisis in 2008 that the Fed acted outside of a scheduled meeting.]\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

Week In Politics: How Likely Are Efforts To Remove Trump To Succeed?\n\nThere are calls from members of both parties for President Trump to resign or be forced out of office for his support of those who attacked the U.S. Capitol. But what chance do those efforts stand?\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nSo what might any consequences for the president be after this week's assault on the nation's Capitol? NPR senior Washington editor and correspondent Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thank you.\n\nRON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.\n\nSIMON: Donald Trump has little more than a week left in office. Senator Murkowski of Alaska called on him to resign yesterday. Democrats in the House are working up articles of impeachment. There has been talk about the 25th Amendment being invoked. Any chance any of these efforts may succeed before President Trump does one or more of the things that they fear he might?\n\nELVING: We are not likely to see the 25th Amendment, Scott. It's never been used except for a matter of hours for medical situations. And resignation would not seem to be in President Trump's nature. So unless Vice President Pence decides to push for it, there does not seem to be enough motivation within the Cabinet to remove him using the 25th Amendment.\n\nThat leaves impeachment. And the single article has already been drafted - impeachment for inciting violence against the government of the United States. And the Democrats seem resolved to press for it on Monday. They would have the votes in the House. But, of course, the Senate would have to follow suit. That seems unlikely before the scheduled transfer of power on January 20. But we could see a return to the issue after that when Trump is gone with the idea of barring him from federal office for life. That historically has been done in a few cases of federal judges who had been impeached and removed.\n\nSIMON: A jarring, bracing note this week when Speaker Pelosi asked the Pentagon about what the options there were for keeping President Trump's hand off the nuclear trigger.\n\nELVING: The Pentagon will only say that she called and a conversation took place. But Pelosi was clearly shaken by Wednesday's traumatic events, and she is deeply concerned about what else Trump or perhaps some of his followers might be capable of in these final days.\n\nSIMON: Let me separate that out. What can the president do, say even this weekend - pardons, for example?\n\nELVING: Yes, he has already issued a slew of pardons. Many consider some of those to be unsavory, including for his former associates who had pled guilty to lying to the FBI and were about to be sentenced to prison. He has pardoned individuals who killed civilians in Iraq while on contract with the U.S. military. And there is a general expectation he will pardon members of his family and quite possibly himself while he still can, although the actual legal effect of a self-pardon has never been tried and remains very much a matter of debate.\n\nSIMON: What could he face as a private citizen?\n\nELVING: That question will probably dominate his thinking in his last days in office, Scott. Legal machinery is already working in New York state, possibly elsewhere, fashioning cases to hold him accountable, perhaps for tax deficiencies. There have been allegations of bank fraud, misrepresentations about his properties, among other possible charges. And state charges would be unaffected by his pardon power, which is strictly for federal crimes. And let's not forget that just last weekend, Trump got on a phone, was taped with the Georgia secretary of state pressuring that official to, quote, find, unquote, enough votes so that Trump could win. That may well be a prosecutable offense as well.\n\nSIMON: And in the meantime, which is an extraordinary way of beginning the sentence, this country is still in extraordinary crisis. The number of coronavirus deaths rises. The number of infections are on the rise. The economic crisis deepens. There's been an extraordinary Russian hacking of security services. We could go on. The coronavirus vaccine rollout has been slow and insufficient. Is President Trump paying attention?\n\nELVING: Ah, yes, the reality check of it all. We do have 4,000 people dying in a single day now. Last month, the economy lost jobs for the first time in eight months. And as you say, the computer systems of our government and other major institutions are under cyberattack from Russia. There is a lot that a president might want to prioritize right now other than his own personal fate.\n\nSIMON: Has Vice President Pence become the real president in all but name for the federal government and the military?\n\nELVING: He certainly has gotten an upgrade in terms of his independence and his integrity. That would be in recognition of his handling of the situation on Wednesday night when he was counting the Electoral College votes, weathering the wrath of the protesters and the president. But where is he now? Is he with Trump or is he not? That will be answered in the week ahead, and that will have a profound effect on what the Congress does and what happens to Donald Trump in the future.\n\nSIMON: NPR senior Washington editor and correspondent Ron Elving, thanks for - nobody better to talk to on this extraordinary week. I'm glad you're with us. Take care, Ron.\n\nELVING: Thank you, Scott.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCopyright © 2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

Gilead Declines 'Rare Disease' Status For Experimental Coronavirus Drug\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIn a surprising turnabout, drugmaker Gilead Sciences asked the Food and Drug administration on Wednesday to rescind orphan status for remdesivir, the company's experimental coronavirus treatment.\n\nThe agency granted this status to remdesivir on Monday, prompting a backlash from public health and consumer advocates. Orphan drug designation is intended to spur development of drugs for rare diseases by bestowing drugmakers with tax breaks, FDA fee waivers and seven years without generic competitors.\n\nAlthough this isn't the first time a company has asked for an orphan designation to be rescinded, it's rare, says James Love, director of Knowledge Ecology International, a non-profit public interest group.\n\nGilead must have been feeling the heat, Love says. I think it's embarrassing to take something that's potentially the most widespread disease in the history of the pharmaceutical industry and claim it's a rare disease.\n\nFor its part, Gilead said it could proceed to develop the drug quickly without the special regulatory status.\n\nGilead is confident that it can maintain an expedited timeline in seeking regulatory review of remdesivir, without the orphan drug designation, the company wrote in a statement. Recent engagement with regulatory agencies has demonstrated that submissions and review relating to remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 are being expedited.\n\nTo get orphan status, a drug company must show its drug serves a population of fewer than 200,000 people in the United States, at the time of the submission of the request for orphan-drug designation. Gilead's latest statement indicates that this was early March.\n\nDomestic COVID-19 cases are expected to surpass that threshold. As of Wednesday afternoon, there were more than 60,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S.\n\nOrphan drugs are among the most expensive in this country, in part because they are shielded from from generic competition for longer than other prescription medicines.\n\nKnowledge Ecology International had been preparing to file a citizen petition to push the FDA to reverse its decision on remdesivir, Love says. Now, it won't have to.\n\nThe facts and circumstances should have given the FDA the authority to have rejected the application, which they did not do, the says.\n\nThe FDA confirmed to NPR that it has received and processed Gilead's request.
Gov. Wolf's budget proposes boosting staff at Pa.'s departments of environmental protection, and conservation and natural resources\n\nIn annual budget address, Wolf talked about need for pipeline reform\n\nSusan Phillips Bio Recent Stories Susan Phillips tells stories about the consequences of political decisions on people's every day lives. She has worked as a reporter for WHYY since 2004. Susan's coverage of the 2008 Presidential election resulted in a story on the front page of the New York Times. In 2010 she traveled to Haiti to cover the earthquake. That same year she produced an award-winning series on Pennsylvania's natural gas rush called The Shale Game. She received a 2013 Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Journalism Award for her work covering natural gas drilling in Pennsylvania. She has also won several Edward R. Murrow awards for her work with StateImpact. In 2013/14 she spent a year at MIT as a Knight Science Journalism Fellow. She has also been a Metcalf Fellow, an MBL Logan Science Journalism Fellow and reported from Marrakech on the 2016 climate talks as an International Reporting Project Fellow. A graduate of Columbia School of Journalism, she earned her Bachelor's degree in International Relations from George Washington University.\n\nGov. Tom Wolf proposed money for additional staffing at the Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and he renewed his support for a package of pipeline reforms, in his annual budget released Tuesday.\n\nThe DEP would get $171.6 million from the general fund in Wolf's proposed budget. Other sources of funding for the agency would result in a total budget of $553.8 million.\n\nAfter decades of cuts to DEP under both Democratic and Republican administrations, it's the first time proposed spending from the general fund for environmental protection has risen above $165.6 million, the level it reached in 1994-1995, according to former DEP Secretary David Hess.\n\nThose cuts had to be backfilled by permit fee increases, Hess said. Those kinds of fee increases were unsustainable.\n\nHess said when he ran DEP from 2001-2003, funding for the agency did not depend so much on permit fees. About half of DEP's current budget relies on those fees, while just 20 percent comes from the general fund, he said. Federal funds make up the rest. In the early 2000s, permit fees, general fund dollars and federal funds each contributed about one-third.\n\nOne result of those cuts has been a 25 percent drop in DEP staff between 2003 and 2018.\n\nThe time has come for the people in the General Assembly to really have some serious conversations about this, Hess said. I see a lot of seeds in this budget that can grow into something that more completely meets our environmental funding obligations.\n\nThe budget calls for an additional $1 million for hiring new DEP staff to support the cleanup of the Chesapeake Bay. Both the state of Maryland and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation recently said they plan to sue the EPA and Pennsylvania for not doing enough to reduce agricultural run-off that contributes to bay pollution.\n\nAbout $47 million is restored from last year's cuts to community-based restoration projects that work on improving waterways that feed into the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nHazardous site cleanup, severance tax and more park rangers\n\nDEP's Bureau of Air Quality would also get a boost under Wolf's proposed plan, which asks for an additional $1.5 million for new staff. And DCNR would get an additional $2.5 million for new state park and forest rangers. A recent report revealed DCNR has a backlog of maintenance projects underfunded by $1 billion. In total, the new budget would provide 25 new staff members at DEP and 25 at DCNR.\n\nWolf is also calling on lawmakers to enact a $1 per ton increase in tipping fees for municipal waste landfill deposits as a way to support the Hazardous Sites Cleanup Fund. The fund is expected to become insolvent by the end of this year, the Wolf administration said, and the governor says increased tipping fees would generate an additional $22.6 million. That could help with any cleanup associated with emerging PFAS contamination.\n\nPennEnvironment executive director David Masur says it's a good sign the proposal includes increased funds.\n\nIt's hard to protect our environment if we don't have the environmental cops on the beat to enforce the laws and implement programs, Masur said. But it would be valuable if we had a long-term plan in order to make DEP and DCNR whole.\n\nThe budget includes a natural gas severance tax to fund Restore PA, a set of infrastructure projects. It's the sixth time Wolf has introduced a severance tax, which has been blocked by the Republican legislature.\n\nThe oil and gas industry opposes the effort, saying it has generated almost $2 billion in impact fee money since 2012.\n\nResponsible natural gas development has been good for the state economy, good for local economies and good for Pennsylvanians, said API-PA director Stephanie Catarino Wissman. This initiative doesn't restore Pennsylvania; it jeopardizes Pennsylvania's economy and the hundreds of thousands of jobs supported by natural gas production.\n\nOpposition to Restore PA comes from the political right as well as some on the left, who see it as a way to continue fossil fuel development.\n\nRestore PA is structured around a severance tax that lasts for another 20 years, said Karen Feridun of the Better Path Coalition. It's bad enough that we would be committed to 20 more years of fracking, (and) it includes incentives for the petrochemical business.\n\nRepublican lawmakers criticized spending in the overall budget. House Republican leaders said in a statement that they share many of the same goals, such as safe schools and jobs, that Wolf talked about.\n\nHowever, we believe that the best way to achieve these goals and turn them into a reality for all our citizens is not just with new government programs, more spending and additional debt, according to the statement.\n\nThese approaches to problem-solving oversimplify the core underlying issues driving the need for state government intervention and they ignore the significant investments that are already being made by taxpayers.\n\nPipeline safety legislation\n\nWolf used the budget to renew his call to close what he calls gaps in pipeline regulation that tie the hands of the executive and independent agencies.\n\nThis proposed rulemaking should enhance pipeline safety in Pennsylvania and move forward expeditiously, Wolf said in a statement. Significant improvements to hazardous liquid public utility safety standards can be accomplished regulatorily by building upon the federal pipeline safety laws.\n\nThe pipeline proposals include granting the Public Utility Commission authority to regulate locations of intrastate lines. No state agency has that authority. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) oversees interstate pipeline siting, but the lack of authority within the state has fueled opposition to lines like Energy Transfer's cross-state Mariner East project. Mariner East 1, 2 and 2x carry or will carry natural gas liquids from western Pa. to an export terminal near Philadelphia.\n\nA bi-partisan package of pipeline safety bills introduced last year by Sen. Tom Killion (R-Chester and Delaware), along with Sen. Andy Dinniman (D-Chester), failed to gain traction.\n\nI was heartened to hear the governor address the need for stronger laws to ensure pipeline public and environmental safety, Dinniman said in a statement. Many of the points he made echoed what I and others have been calling for over the past six years here in Chester County and Harrisburg.\n\nWolf urged lawmakers to enact measures that require emergency response plans for schools and childcare centers that are within 1,000 feet of a pipeline; five-day advanced notice to residents and municipalities of any pipeline construction; and PUC-generated setbacks for residential neighborhoods, education facilities and hospitals.\n\nFor natural gas pipelines, Wolf stressed the need for legislation addressing emergency response, including operators sharing emergency response and evacuation plans with local emergency managers; sharing emergency response plans with the PUC; and requiring emergency shut-off valves in high consequence, or highly populated, areas. He also wants DEP to have the ability to establish setbacks from wetlands and waterways.\n\nIn his address, Wolf talked about using funds from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a carbon cap-and-trade program among Northeast states aimed at addressing climate change, to help fund environmental protection.\n\nAnd by joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, we can raise hundreds of millions of dollars in auction proceeds to make our air cleaner and our transit systems stronger so that Pennsylvanians can get to the jobs businesses are creating, he said.\n\nWolf signed an executive order in October directing DEP to draft regulations on joining RGGI. The program puts a price on power plant carbon emissions, which are then traded at auction. Some lawmakers have opposed the effort.\n\nCorrection: The original version of this story incorrectly named the chair of the state Republican party and used comments made about last year's budget proposal. The story has been updated with comment from Pennsylvania House Republican leaders.\n\nEditor's Picks
House Democrats Introduce Anti-Corruption Bill As Symbolic 1st Act\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIt isn't your usual bill, the For The People Act introduced Friday by House Democrats. Also known as HR 1, symbolically their first legislation, it is a 571-page compendium of existing problems and proposed solutions in four political hot zones: voting, political money, redistricting and ethics.\n\nA pledge to pass the bill was a common theme among Democratic House candidates last year.\n\nWe heard loud and clear from the American people, Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Md., told reporters Friday. They feel left out and locked out from their own democracy.\n\nIf the bill ever becomes law, it's unlikely to happen this year. Republicans control the Senate, President Trump is in the White House, and the GOP vehemently opposes the basic approach of HR 1.\n\nThis is obviously a pretty radical expansion of the regulation of political speech, said David Keating, president of the conservative Institute for Free Speech. If this bill had become law now, he said, anti-Trump groups would find it very difficult to speak as effectively as they have over the past two years.\n\nSome of the bill's provisions push the envelope, including reaching into state law. To settle the controversy over redistricting, the bill would simply take away the power of state legislatures to draw congressional districts and have independent commissions do it instead. That way, presumably, the local politicians could no longer gerrymander the districts to help their party and cripple the opposition.\n\nBut some other proposals are not surprising. The bill includes an update of the Disclose Act, a pro-transparency measure that Democrats have introduced regularly since 2010 — not that Republicans are any more likely to embrace it than they were back then.\n\nHere's a rundown of the bill's major provisions:\n\nVoting and election laws\n\nVoter registration would be made easier. Citizens could register online or get registered automatically, via data from driver's licenses or other government sources. For federal elections, states would have to provide same-day registration and at least 15 days of early voting. Election Day would be a federal holiday.\n\nThe bill would crack down on efforts to take voters off the rolls or prevent them from casting ballots. Felons could regain their voting rights after finishing their sentences.\n\nFederal elections would require paper ballots to prevent computer tampering. State chief election officials couldn't get involved in federal campaigns.\n\nThe bill would declare an intent to revive core anti-discrimination provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that were effectively shut down by the Supreme Court six years ago. It would also state that failing to vote isn't grounds for taking away a person's voter registration.\n\nCampaign finance\n\nProvisions from the Disclose Act would expand the prohibition on foreign political money and mandate the disclosure of the big donors behind politically active 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations.\n\nDigital companies, like Facebook and Google, would have to set up public databases cataloging political ad purchase requests of $500 or more and create new measures to block ad buys by foreign nationals.\n\nPresidential inaugural committees would have to disclose expenditures, in addition to the existing requirement for donor disclosure. This is a response to reports of unexplained spending by Trump's inaugural committee.\n\nA new matching-fund program would support House candidates who agree to raise only small-dollar contributions. (Similar provisions for Senate candidates would have to come from the Senate.) The public financing system for presidential candidates, largely irrelevant since 2012, would be updated.\n\nThe bill would quash sidecar superPACs that support individual candidates.\n\nEthics
Satirist Randy Rainbow Uses Show Tunes And Pop Songs To Lampoon Trump\n\nI always considered song parody kind of cheap, the Emmy-nominated lyricist and performer says. But ... I've gotten [such a] response from others ... that I'm appreciating it as an art form.\n\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Song parodies about President Trump and members of his administration - that's what my guest Randy Rainbow has become famous for. He borrows the melodies of show tunes and pop hits and writes original lyrics. He took the melody of the Mary Poppins song Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious and turned it into a Trump song titled Super-Callous Fragile-Egocentric Braggadocious.\n\nRainbow performs each song within a video that typically also includes him interviewing Trump, a trick Rainbow accomplishes by re-editing videos of Trump interviews and inserting himself asking the questions and reacting to the answers. These YouTube videos go viral, and that's a tribute to Rainbow's clever lyrics, his great singing voice and hilarious reaction shots.\n\nYesterday, right after we recorded our interview, his YouTube series of satirical songs was nominated for an Emmy for outstanding short-form variety series. Let's start with one of his songs that borrows the melody from My Favorite Things. This is Trump's Favorite Things!, recorded last December when special counsel Robert Mueller was about to file memos about Michael Flynn, Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. This starts with Randy Rainbow interviewing President Trump.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, TRUMP'S FAVORITE THINGS!)\n\nRANDY RAINBOW: Thank you so much for joining me, Mr. President. I hope you have been enjoying the holiday season so far.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I will tell you I am extremely upbeat. The White House is running like a...\n\nRAINBOW: Defenseless young child being tear-gassed at the Mexican border.\n\nTRUMP: ...Well-oiled machine.\n\nRAINBOW: Oh, mine was just an expression.\n\nTRUMP: It's doing really well. I have great people.\n\nRAINBOW: Speaking of criminals, this is a very big week for the Russia investigation.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF THUNDER)\n\nRAINBOW: Memos about Michael Flynn, Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort, three high-profile defendants, are scheduled to be filed by special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF THUNDER)\n\nTRUMP: It's a scam. There was no collusion whatsoever, and the whole thing is a scam.\n\nRAINBOW: Really? Because word on the street is that you're getting pretty scared. Well, when anything bothers me or my entire family is about to be charged with treason, I try to think of nice things. I mean, there are so many things that make you happy.\n\nTRUMP: And there are certain things that I don't like.\n\nRAINBOW: Oh, let me think - raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, destroying the First Amendment, white nationalists.\n\nTRUMP: Is that enough?\n\nRAINBOW: Brutal dictators and cold-hearted liars (singing) tyrants and traitors and climate deniers, $5 spray tans with under-eye rings - these are a few of your favorite things. Burying tax returns after you file them, tear-gassing migrants for seeking asylum, big fat a** buckets of fried chicken wings - these are a few of your favorite things.\n\nTRUMP: I did nothing wrong.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) Blue-collar workers all backwoods and beefy, giant hamburgers with extra covfefe, siding with Saudi Arabian kings - these are a few of your favorite things. When friends flip, when your day sucks and your hair looks bad, like right now, just blame all the victims and praise all the schmucks, and then you won't feel so sad.\n\nTRUMP: How long has this witch hunt gone on? It's gone on for what?\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) KGB play dates and absolute power, porn stars and playmates who charge by the hour, puppets at Fox News who dance on his strings - these are a few of his favorite things.\n\nTRUMP: I did nothing wrong.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) Long-winded tweets with no spell check corrections...\n\nGROSS: Randy Rainbow, welcome to FRESH AIR. I think you are so funny and so much fun to watch. Thank you for being on our show.\n\nRAINBOW: Thank you. It's my honor to be with you.\n\nGROSS: So you do your videos in your home alone. You direct yourself. How many - I love your reaction shots because you have this, like, incredibly expressive face and really big eyes. And your reaction shots to what, you know, Trump is saying are always, like, hilarious. How do you direct yourself, and how many takes do you do?\n\nRAINBOW: Well, I've kind of worked it down to about four or five takes because I could stand there all day. And, you know, as a director, I'm quite hard on myself. The reaction shots are something that I've learned from my audience is more valuable than I even knew. I think that I did inherit a very expressive face from my mother and my grandmother. And yeah sometimes just a look to the camera or a slow burn says much more than even, you know, a song.\n\nGROSS: And it sounds like - you know, so you do this, like, alone in your apartment.\n\nRAINBOW: It's a very lonely existence, Terry.\n\nGROSS: I feel really sorry for you (laughter).\n\nRAINBOW: Thank you for inviting me out of my home. It doesn't happen often.\n\nGROSS: But it sounds like when you were a kid, you did similar stuff. You spent a lot of time alone in your bedroom making videos. What kind of videos did you make?\n\nRAINBOW: Oh, God. They were real classics, real gems.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nRAINBOW: I mean, I - you know, I would have, like, my little figurines, my toy soldiers and things - well, I say soldiers, but, of course, I mean Barbies.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nRAINBOW: And I would do, you know, sort of horrible DIY kind of stop motion animation. It was really bad. And then I - you know, I had a bunch of friends. I grew up doing theater. I would go to theater camp. And so I found a lot of like-minded young kids who were into performance. And we would get together and make videos. And that's kind of how I got started in the sketch comedy world. And that's what ignited my interest there.\n\nGROSS: So we'll get back to theater camp.\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: But another question about your videos...\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: You have an orchestra behind you when you're singing in your videos. Are those kind of, like, karaoke versions of the show tunes?\n\nRAINBOW: They are, yes. They're - they are ripped karaoke versions that I play with and sort of fine-tune and adjust to be, you know, unique to my videos.\n\nGROSS: And are you going to be sued by any of the estates (laughter)...\n\nRAINBOW: Well, now that...\n\nGROSS: ...Whose composers' work you're using?\n\nRAINBOW: Can we go to the next question? No, I do have a very fancy lawyer now, and what I do falls pretty safely under fair use, you know, with...\n\nGROSS: Oh, good.\n\nRAINBOW: ...Parody and all of that.\n\nGROSS: Good. Please do not deny us these...\n\nRAINBOW: So far, so good.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. OK.\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nRAINBOW: We'll see after this interview airs. Thanks a lot.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) Right. Well, I don't think Sondheim's going to be suing you...\n\nRAINBOW: No, thankfully.\n\nGROSS: ...'Cause he's a fan of your work. Yeah.\n\nRAINBOW: Can you believe it? You mentioned Sondheim. But I have, I'm happy to say, heard from most of the composers that I have parodied - everyone from Sondheim to Steven Schwartz to Andrew Lloyd Webber. So everyone is pretty much on board. So I have that in my corner, too.\n\nGROSS: That's great that the songwriters really love your work.\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: So if you're just joining us, my guest is Randy Rainbow, who does song parodies - like, political ones - using Trump within the parodies and then doing songs about Trump. So this next song we're going to hear is He's In Love (And We're All Gonna Die), sung for - sung to the melody of I'm In Love With A Wonderful Guy from South Pacific.\n\nRAINBOW: That's right.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. This starts with you interviewing President Trump - again, taking Trump answers and inserting your own questions. And it starts with a little, like, take off of The Bachelor. So let's hear Randy Rainbow, He's In Love (And We're All Gonna Die).\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, HE'S IN LOVE (AND WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE))\n\nRAINBOW: I'm here now with the latest castoff from The Bachelor Hanoi, fresh off his second meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nI don't see a rose. Does that mean no denuclearization?\n\nTRUMP: We didn't sign anything today. It didn't quite work out.\n\nRAINBOW: Did you guys do it?\n\nTRUMP: I just don't think maybe either of us were ready.\n\nRAINBOW: So does that mean we can expect a third date?\n\nTRUMP: We'll see what happens. Again, the relationship is very good. He likes me. I like him. Some people say, oh, you shouldn't like him. I said, why shouldn't I like him?\n\nRAINBOW: Maybe because he's a deranged dictator who starves his people and executes members of his own family. But you know, we all have - my boyfriend doesn't put down the toilet seat, so - men.\n\nTRUMP: Well, no. I just think he's - first of all, he's a character.\n\nRAINBOW: What's your response to critics who accuse you of consistently siding with foreign adversaries over your own intelligence officials?\n\nTRUMP: Why shouldn't I like him? I like him, get along great.\n\nRAINBOW: And what do you say to those who worry that your naivete and reckless behavior are jeopardizing national security and putting us all in grave danger?\n\nTRUMP: We'll see what happens. Again, the relationship is very good.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) You would think he'd obey when his own intel agencies tell him to watch out for Putin and Kim.\n\nTRUMP: He's a real personality, and he's very smart. He's sharp as you can be, and he's a real leader.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) But he's too egocentric to do what those men think is best for the country instead of for him.\n\nTRUMP: He likes me. I like him. Some people say, oh, you shouldn't like him. I said, why shouldn't I like him?\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) Yet he's as obedient as a tiny pup for any louse on a nuclear list.\n\nTRUMP: Look. Bottom line - I think he wants to get something done.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) 'Cause when his own daddy issues start flaring up, there's not a psychopath he can resist.\n\nTRUMP: He's sharp as you can be, and he's a real leader.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) So unabashedly he reveals...\n\nTRUMP: And he's very smart.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) ...Those sad, lovely feelings he feels. He gets horny for absolute power. Treacherous goons put a gleam in his eye. His taste in men stinks. Now he says that he thinks he's in love, and we're all going to die. He goes mad for a mad, crazy tyrant who rapes and pillages, murders and lies - merely faux pas he lets slide just because he's in love with these wonderful guys. Of a snitch under oath, on a witch hunt or anyone who disagrees - he's a hater. But ruthless dictators sure make him go weak in the knees. He goes cuckoo...\n\nGROSS: That's Randy Rainbow - one of his many political song parodies to show tunes and pop songs.\n\nHave you learned a lot about writing lyrics from doing this? What I mean is, like, you're patterning your lyrics on some of the best lyricists who've ever written for the stage. And you're frequently following their rhyme schemes, which are sometimes pretty complicated, depending on whose work you're doing. But have you learned a lot from using the greatest lyricists' work as your template to write your own lyrics?\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah, absolutely. I have, and I've pushed myself to do so because I always considered song parody kind of cheap. And I've always been - part of me - a little embarrassed that I do it and that I'm, you know, kind of ripping off other people's work. But it's only now that I'm - that I've been doing it - and then I've gotten response from others, including the actual artists who originated the work, that I'm appreciating it as an art form. But I think that I've pushed myself because I think that if I'm not going to write the original music to go with the lyrics, I'd better step it up and bring something special and strong to the table.\n\nGROSS: So how did you match Trump's second meeting with Kim Jong Un with I'm In Love With A Wonderful Guy? How did those two things come together in your mind?\n\nRAINBOW: Well, that was one, I think - I think I have - I have a running list that I sort of refer to, and that was a song that I wanted to do for a while. So I had just been waiting for the right opportunity to do it and - you know, just a classic love song. So I figured it was right for him and Kim.\n\nGROSS: Kim's in love with him. He's in love with him.\n\nRAINBOW: Kim's in love with him. There you go.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) So who are some of the lyricists you've come to really appreciate?\n\nRAINBOW: Well, Sondheim has always been a god to me. He's really the main one. But I appreciate - I mean, Lin-Manuel Miranda is fabulous.\n\nGROSS: So I know Sondheim, one of your favorite lyricists, loves puzzles. But you loved puzzles, too, as a kid, right?\n\nRAINBOW: I did have a thing for mazes. When I was a kid, I remember drawing little mazes constantly and puzzles. I loved that. And I remember - to sort of tie it together, I - when I started listening to Sondheim's music, I always envisioned - I always pictured a puzzle 'cause that's sort of how his lyric writing is. It's, you know, very carefully and masterfully putting a puzzle together. And so when I got to know him and was invited to his home, and I saw that he's a collector of puzzles, it was quite a full circle moment.\n\nGROSS: How did you get to know Sondheim?\n\nRAINBOW: Well, I've been friends with his now-husband for many years. And so I was first introduced to him about 10 years ago when I was working with him - with Jeff, who's now working with me on my tour. So that's how he first came into my life. And since then, he's become something of a mentor and a great support.\n\nGROSS: Does he ever give you advice on lyrics?\n\nRAINBOW: He knows better than that, Terry. No, he's...\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) He knows who the master is.\n\nRAINBOW: He does. He's very generous. He's extremely generous. And he will compliment me all the time and say, your lyrics are so strong and, you know, how do you do it? - to which I say, Steve, you know, you wouldn't get it.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nRAINBOW: I have a gift - not about to explain it to you.\n\nGROSS: Let's take a short break, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Randy Rainbow, and he does really funny song parodies about, typically, President Trump or, sometimes, Mike Pence. We'll be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Randy Rainbow. And he writes and records song parodies, usually taking Broadway melodies and setting his own satirical lyrics to them. Typically, the songs are about President Trump or politics. And he posts them on YouTube; they get a gazillion views. And in August, he's going to start touring again with his show of his songs.\n\nSo, you know, you've mentioned that a lot of songwriters like your work. I know a lot of Broadway people love your work. What about President Trump and Vice President Pence? Have they ever commented...\n\nRAINBOW: They're big fans.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) They're big fans, I'm sure.\n\nRAINBOW: We're all having brunch next Sunday.\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: And they brought pink eyeglasses in honor of your - as a tribute to you.\n\nRAINBOW: Absolutely. You know.\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nRAINBOW: I haven't heard from anyone in the administration. You know, I've heard through the grapevine that people in the administration are fans, but no one has directly reached out to me. I'm trying every day to, you know, at least be blocked by him on Twitter, but there has been no connection.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) Haven't gotten that far yet?\n\nRAINBOW: No, but I'm working on it.\n\nGROSS: OK. So let's hear another song, and this is to the tune of Sixteen Going On Seventeen from The Sound Of Music. And the song is about President Trump's endorsement of Roy Moore, the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. And this is when Moore was running for the Senate against Democrat Doug Jones. And Trump endorsed Moore in spite of the fact that several women had come forward and accused Moore of sexual misconduct with them when they were underage girls.\n\nSo the song is about those girls, and it starts off with a verse about the girl who became his wife. And the setup is that Randy Rainbow is interviewing Kellyanne Conway, who is defending Trump's endorsement of Moore. So it starts - we're going to start by hearing Kellyanne.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nKELLYANNE CONWAY: So the president has said the allegations are troubling. They're also 40 years old. Nobody came forward before. The guy's been on the ballot many times. Doug Jones is a liberal Democrat, the president has said, and he doesn't want a liberal Democrat representing Alabama in the United States Senate.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) You wait, Kellyanne, with your ashy knees. It's time that you surrender. You are backing a man who admits that he's a bona fide sex offender.\n\nCONWAY: OK, but wait - did we...\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) Offender.\n\nCONWAY: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Excuse me. Excuse me.\n\nRAINBOW: In Roy Moore's memoir, I Like Big Butts, he recounts, romantically, the first time he laid eyes on his wife Kayla, writing, quote, I attended a dance recital and remember one of the special dances performed by a young woman whose first and last names began with the letter K. I always remembered her initials, K.K., because they were just one K short of being awesome. I'm paraphrasing that last part.\n\nCONWAY: Go ahead.\n\nRAINBOW: Well, there's just one troubling part about that timeline, and it's that...\n\nCONWAY: Hurry - I have a meeting.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) She was 16, going on 17; Roy Moore was 32. Flagrantly lusting - he's just disgusting, and frankly, so are you. She was 17, going on 18, when she went out with Moore. Think it's a smear? Look - he signed her yearbook when he was 34. Here comes Steve Bannon, Trump and Pence, McConnell, Mike and Ben, fashioning false equivalence, protecting gross old men.\n\nThat's so funny. What a surprise.\n\n(Singing) He wants a Republican candidate even though he may be criminal, deplorable, immoral, illegitimate - that's 'cause so is he.\n\nTRUMP: Get out and vote for Roy Moore.\n\nGROSS: That's Randy Rainbow. And if you want to see more of his videos, they're all on YouTube. And that was recorded December 11, 2017. And if you think that that song is hopelessly out of date because Roy Moore lost, consider that in June, Roy Moore announced he intends on running again for the Senate. So Sixteen Going On Seventeen seems like an obvious song choice to use for the Roy Moore story. But how did you make that connection in your mind? It seems obvious after somebody makes the connection for you, but how did you think of using that melody?\n\nRAINBOW: You know what? I think that one was a request. Now I have this nice following, so sometimes I will take requests from my fans online, and I think that was one of them.\n\nGROSS: Have you heard from Roy Moore?\n\nRAINBOW: No, surprisingly.\n\nGROSS: Yeah, a bit surprising.\n\nRAINBOW: Hasn't been to one of my meet-and-greets.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nMy guest is Randy Rainbow. Yesterday, he was nominated for an Emmy for his YouTube series of videos featuring him performing his satirical songs about President Trump and his administration. We'll talk more after a break, and we'll listen back to my 2011 interview with former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens. He died yesterday at the age of 99. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TROTTER TRIO'S I'M STILL HERE)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview with Randy Rainbow. He writes and performs song parodies about President Trump and his administration. Rainbow uses the melodies of show tunes and pop hits and writes original lyrics. His YouTube videos were just nominated for an Emmy for outstanding short-form variety series.\n\nSo you were in, like, your mid-30s when people started to really know you. Did you think, like, it wasn't going to happen; that you weren't going to have the career you wanted; that you'd be doing, like, other jobs, you know, and then, you know, moonlighting with things that you wanted to do?\n\nRAINBOW: I think other people probably thought that about me, but I have some kind of weird inner quality that - it's just a confidence that I have. I'm very - I'm not very sure of anything in my life, but there's always been something in me that has known that I'm going to get where I'm going, one way or the other. So it really was never a concern to me. I always knew if I just stuck to my guns and did what I wanted to do and put out work that I thought was good and funny and entertaining, it would work out.\n\nGROSS: You say you had this, like, confidence. But at the same time, based on what I read, you didn't have that confidence when you were auditioning at cattle calls for Broadway shows.\n\nRAINBOW: No, I've never been good at auditions. That's why this whole Internet thing we've got going has been such a blessing for me. And the fact that I've been able to utilize it to get myself out there is really something I'm really grateful for because it's given me the opportunity to produce things, you know, for myself in the way that I want to present myself to the world and then put them out there. I don't know if I didn't have that ability that things would've taken off as they did.\n\nGROSS: Sensibility-wise, you are, like, the opposite of Donald Trump. But in spite of being so different from Trump, you've said that Trump reminds you of your father.\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah, Trump is absolutely a carbon copy of my father. And...\n\nGROSS: How?\n\nRAINBOW: Well, just behaviorally and - so much so that my father, who's no longer with us - he actually died shortly after Trump's election - but his campaign was going on, you know, at the end of his life. And even he said that he couldn't watch Trump on TV because it reminded him so much of himself. So these conversations that the world is now having about Trump's behavior are conversations that were had within my family about my dad constantly. So I think that's kind of why I really have his number.\n\nGROSS: So what were the similarities?\n\nRAINBOW: Just that kind of phony, you know, bravado. And there's just, like, a - you know, I hate to put down any group of people, but there's just a generation of, like, New York guy that - he just came from that stock. And it was just - there was nothing genuine, nothing introspective. It was just textbook narcissism. And I think there are - there's a large group of men who are like that.\n\nGROSS: So how did that affect you growing up?\n\nRAINBOW: Well, it was hard. I mean, it was - it made things very uncomfortable in my home and - you know, which is why I was locked in my room, making videos with my Barbie dolls. It was not a pleasant experience. It was not a pleasant environment because it really just - he was the nucleus, and it just revolved around this man who was really sick.\n\nGROSS: Was he ever in therapy?\n\nRAINBOW: No, I don't believe so. No. He had no interest. I don't think - again, he really had no idea that there was anything wrong with him. It was everybody else.\n\nGROSS: Was there this feeling in the house that unless your father was pleased that there would be, like, a dark cloud hanging over the family?\n\nRAINBOW: Absolutely. Yeah. And it was a full-time job to sort of, you know, try to brush the cloud away. And you know, that's why I was really happy at 21 to leave the house. And that's kind of where - when my life really began and I kind of came out of my shell.\n\nGROSS: How - what was his reaction to you being gay?\n\nRAINBOW: He was - you know, for as negative a force he was in my life, he was also - he was not the worst. He was very tolerant and did not mind at all that I was gay. He also claims to have had no idea growing up, so that shows you sort of how, you know, trapped in his own brain he was. He had - you know, it was a total shock to him when I came out, which was kind of absurd.\n\nGROSS: But your mother said she always knew. She was quoted in the...\n\nRAINBOW: Well, she may have made this guy.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) Yeah, 'cause that's the way it works.\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: So she was quoted in The Washington Post as saying she knew that you were gay when you were 3.\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah. And I guess, you know...\n\nGROSS: I'll quote.\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: She says, I knew he was gay by the time he was 3. He was constantly putting on shows and making the girls be the prince. He was always Snow White.\n\nRAINBOW: (Laughter) It's true. We would do major productions in my backyard, and I was really a nightmare to work with as a director. And yeah, there was a lot of gender swapping.\n\nGROSS: Do you think that if that was happening today, your mother would think, gee, is my child trans? Should I...\n\nRAINBOW: I often think of that, and I don't know. She very well might. And I think of that because I was an effeminate kid and - but I don't necessarily think - you know, I know I'm not trans. I don't feel - I don't think I ever felt that I was trapped in the wrong body. But yeah, I think that the lines are a little blurred now, and people are still kind of figuring those things out. I hear directly from parents all the time who have those questions.\n\nGROSS: So what were the first musicals your mother took you to?\n\nRAINBOW: The first musicals - well, I have this thing with Cats, no shade to Andrew Lloyd Webber. But you know, back to Sondheim - I remember being in New York and seeing the commercial for Into The Woods on TV, and that was all I wanted to see. It's all I cared about. But much to my chagrin, the first show they took me to was Cats.\n\nAnd so I remember having a - you know, a temper tantrum walking under the marquee for Into The Woods. But she would put - my mother put me to bed - I mean, talking about making me gay - I joke, but only half. She would put me to sleep with the cast recordings to Oklahoma and The Music Man. And I think that contributed a lot to my musicality and my love for musical theater, for sure.\n\nGROSS: You've done a parody of Trouble In River City from The Music Man.\n\nRAINBOW: Yes, I open my live show with it now, actually.\n\nGROSS: Oh, do you really?\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Oh. Do you want to do some of the patter for us?\n\nRAINBOW: Sure.\n\nI said, you got trouble, my friends. Right here - you got trouble right here in America. Sure, I'm a liberal and a gay, I'm mighty proud to say. Well, I'm kind of scared to say it. I admit that when Trump threw his name in the race, I assumed he was joking. You know how he jokes about stuff with his cool swag and his orange face. And then he started showing up and winning in the polls, like, a lot. And I was like, oh bleep.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) Yeah.\n\nRAINBOW: It's better with the band, Terry.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) Yeah.\n\nRAINBOW: You'll have to come see a live show.\n\nGROSS: No, no that is great. Let's take a short break, and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Randy Rainbow. And he does really funny song parodies about President Trump. We'll be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Randy Rainbow. He writes and performs satirical songs about President Trump and his administration. Rainbow writes original lyrics set to the melodies of show tunes and pop hits.\n\nYou always wanted to get back to New York and try Broadway. So when you got to New York when you were in your 20s, what did you audition for, and what were those auditions like?\n\nRAINBOW: I came to New York, and I put the whole thing on hold because I was a terrified 21-year-old and more, like, you know, 15 because I just had not at all grown up. I don't know what gave me the courage to even come here and live on my own, but I just knew this is where I belong. But I did not go right into the musical theater audition thing. I instead worked in a lot of offices and restaurants and things like that.\n\nGROSS: Did any of the, like, food restaurant bar kind of jobs you have have a theatrical aspect to it, like a piano bar or anything like that?\n\nRAINBOW: Well, the first restaurant I worked in was Hooters.\n\nGROSS: OK, that's - you don't have what you - it typically takes to work there.\n\nRAINBOW: Well, that's very rude of you to say.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nRAINBOW: But no, I - when I first moved to New York, my dear friend from childhood was working at Hooters as a waitress and said the manager here is a gay guy. And if you come in, he'll probably give you a job. So I worked first at Hooters as a host. So you can imagine the look of dismay on the gentlemen's faces when they would come in after a hard day's work and I'd be standing there with my clipboard. So that was the first thing.\n\nBut that led to my working at the restaurant in Chelsea, which eventually led because of a friend who worked there then started working at a production office - a Broadway production office where I became a receptionist.\n\nGROSS: So...\n\nRAINBOW: And that was kind of where I got my foot back in show business a little bit. They were working on shows at the time like Hairspray and the revival of Sweeney Todd with Patti Lupone.\n\nGROSS: Oh.\n\nRAINBOW: So for me it was heaven because I was sitting behind the desk, and at any given moment, Patti Lupone would call, or Elaine Stritch would walk through the front door. And I couldn't get over my life.\n\nGROSS: Did you talk with them?\n\nRAINBOW: A little bit. I was so scared out of my wits that, you know, not much came out. But yeah, I had some interactions.\n\nGROSS: Do you know Patti Lupone better now?\n\nRAINBOW: Do I know her better? No, I don't. But I did do - before Trump came along and I was doing those more nonpolitical videos, I did a series of videos where I would lip sync to Patti Lupone's autobiography...\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nRAINBOW: ...You know, the audiobook of it.\n\nGROSS: That's hilarious, yeah.\n\nRAINBOW: And that was actually a - fairly a - at least among the gay and Broadway communities was kind of a fairly successful series for me. And I understand that she was a fan of that. I hope so.\n\nGROSS: How did you think of doing that?\n\nRAINBOW: I don't know (laughter). I think I was just drunk one night and listening to her. Have you heard her autobiography, the audio...\n\nGROSS: No.\n\nRAINBOW: ...Book version?\n\nGROSS: No, I haven't.\n\nRAINBOW: I highly recommend it. It's eight years of Patti Lupone just letting everyone have it and just, you know - just - it just - it moved me to sort of act it out and add some drama to it and some visuals.\n\nGROSS: Let's close with a Sondheim melody that you used for a parody. This is The Mueller Blues, and this was recorded in March 28, 2019. And it's to the melody of The God-Why-Don't-You-Love-Me Blues from Stephen Sondheim's show Follies. So talk about what you're doing in this song.\n\nRAINBOW: Well, this for me was the perfect song to kind of pinpoint the emotions that everyone was feeling that week because the Mueller report had come out, but it hadn't really. And people were happy, and they were not. And they were frustrated. It was just - everyone was sort of running this gamut of emotions. And so my mind immediately went to this song, which kind of encapsulates that feeling of being all over the place.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. And you know, he's almost having, like, a little nervous breakdown...\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...In Follies...\n\nRAINBOW: Yeah, it's very breakdown-y.\n\nGROSS: ...When he sings this, yeah. So this was recorded right after the Mueller report was released. And right now I think you're waiting for Robert Mueller to testify so that you can write a Robert Mueller testifying parody.\n\nRAINBOW: I am. I've been waiting for some time now. They keep pushing it. Yeah, I'm toying with a few ideas, but I don't think I'll really know which direction I'll take until I see the testimony.\n\nGROSS: Well, while we're waiting for you to write and then post it on YouTube, let's hear your song from March of this year, The Mueller Blues. Randy Rainbow, it's just been great to talk with you. Thank you so much, and please keep doing what you're doing and do other things, too, 'cause I look forward to seeing you in a Broadway show or on TV.\n\nRAINBOW: Oh, wow - from your mouth. Thank you, Terry. It's been a pleasure to talk to you.\n\nGROSS: And to you. And I should say that this song starts with you being interviewed, so to speak, by Wolf Blitzer of CNN about the results of Robert Mueller's investigation into the Trump campaign coordination with the Russians. And then you start singing about the results of the investigation.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, THE MUELLER BLUES)\n\nWOLF BLITZER: According to the special counsel, Robert Mueller, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government. Are you ready to accept that conclusion from Robert Mueller?\n\nRAINBOW: A hundred percent, Wolf. This is only good news for the country, and I am here today to say that I am ready to leave this behind us and move on without some big song and dance. Excuse me.\n\n(Singing) O-M-G. He's reached a conclusion. Holy [expletive]. I'm sorry to curse, b****. Thankfully, there's been no collusion. So why don't I feel better yet? In fact, I feel worse.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: The Mueller report now turned in; Robert Mueller's work is over.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) It's lasted 22 months. It's no wonder we're stressed. I wish we could just let it go. The things that we learned are not what we guessed. And as for the rest, we may never know.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON: How much, if anything, will America get to see?\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) I've got those, yay, it's finally over - wait; it's only just beginning blues. Those damn you, Robert Mueller - I mean, thank you for your service feelings. Those give me that report; now throw this trash in the bin. Congratulations, Hannity. But wait. What'd you win? Those what about obstruction? Here comes Rudy Giuliani feelings. Those is it really over? Can we still indict Ivanka? - blues.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Robert Mueller has delivered his report, but the political fight over it is just beginning.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) Repeatedly, he stated...\n\nTRUMP: No collusion.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) He said - I guess that he was right.\n\nTRUMP: Are there any Russians here tonight?\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) Is he exonerated?\n\nTRUMP: Total exoneration.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) Technically, not quite.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Mueller's stopping short of exonerating the president.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) His comments were off-color.\n\nTRUMP: And we kicked their a**.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) He'd constantly deny...\n\nTRUMP: No collusion. No collusion. No collusion. No collusion.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) ...And slander Mr. Mueller.\n\nTRUMP: Look. The entire thing has been a witch hunt.\n\nRAINBOW: (Singing) Now, look who's his favorite guy. I've got those, Nancy, go and get him. Never mind, girl, I'm exhausted blues, Mueller blues. Those, what the hell is Comey doing standing in a forest? - feelings. Host, bartender, we're going to need to refill my cup. And since there's no collusion, could you make something up? And why does Devin's cow have way more followers than I do? - feelings. Those, is it over? What just happened? Can't we just arrest Ivanka? Where's the rest? I got to see it. Give it to me. I don't want it. Yes. No. Black. White. Red. Blue. Left. Right. Thank you. Go away now. Please don't leave me, Robert Mueller, blues.\n\nTRUMP: No collusion.\n\nRAINBOW: Impeach.\n\nGROSS: That's Randy Rainbow's song The Robert Mueller Blues. You can hear more of his songs on his website. His videos were just nominated for an Emmy in the category outstanding short form variety series. He'll resume his national performing tour next month.\n\nComing up, we'll listen back to my interview with former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens. He died yesterday.

Senate Can't Vote On $15 Minimum Wage, Parliamentarian Rules\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nUpdated at 9:27 p.m. ET\n\nSenate Democrats will not be forced to confront an internal political battle over increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 following a decision by the primary keeper of Senate rules.\n\nThe Senate parliamentarian ruled that a plan to gradually increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025 does not fit the complicated rules that govern budget bills in the Senate. House Democrats included the measure in a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill that is expected to be the first major legislative act for President Biden.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he is disappointed in the decision and pledged to pursue other legislation to increase the minimum wage.\n\nWe are not going to give up the fight to raise the minimum wage to $15 to help millions of struggling American workers and their families, Schumer said in a statement. The American people deserve it, and we are committed to making it a reality.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, praised the ruling, saying it was the appropriate path to protect the rules of the Senate.\n\nThe decision is a disappointment for progressives but relieves immediate pressure on Democratic Party leaders who are attempting to rally support for the overall bill despite concerns from at least two Democrats who say $15 is too high.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said President Biden, who proposed the $15 minimum wage as part of his American Recue Plan, is disappointed but that he urges Congress to move quickly to pass the relief. It also said he will work with leaders in Congress to determine the best path forward.\n\nSens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., are the only Democrats who have publicly opposed the idea, but many others have been selectively silent on the issue.\n\nDemocrats were bracing for the measure to be removed from the bill, and the path to an increase is much more difficult in the Senate, where most legislation needs 60 votes to avoid a filibuster. Senate Republicans are almost uniformly opposed to the plan, and a stand-alone bill to increase the minimum wage, introduced by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has 37 co-sponsors, meaning a number of Democrats may not back the idea.\n\nIn a statement, Sanders said that in the coming days he will be working with my colleagues in the Senate to move forward with an amendment to take tax deductions away from large, profitable corporations that don't pay workers at least $15 an hour and to provide small businesses with the incentives they need to raise wages.\n\nThat amendment must be included in this reconciliation bill, he continued.\n\nNo Republicans are expected to vote for the massive spending package, meaning there will need to be unanimous support among Democrats to advance Biden's first major legislative priority.
Apple Tax Ruling Presents Broader Implications For U.S. Companies\n\nNPR's Ari Shapiro talks to Edward Kleinbard, professor of business and law at the University of Southern California, about the implications of the Apple tax ruling for U.S. companies in Europe.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nHere in the U.S., the negative response to the commission's Apple ruling went beyond the Treasury Department. Republicans and Democrats in Congress condemned it, calling the decision a money grab. All this comes after Apple has been criticized in the last few years for avoiding taxes here in the States by setting up subsidiaries in Ireland. To understand this, I spoke with Edward Kleinbard, a professor of law and business at USC.\n\nEDWARD KLEINBARD: Logically the United States should be troubled by the low tax rate in Ireland, and it should be not at all troubled by the commission's finding that Ireland entered into a one-off negotiated deal to subsidize Apple.\n\nSHAPIRO: But (laughter)...\n\nKLEINBARD: But the politics being what they are, it's natural for politicians to get a little confused and to think that those guys are ganging up on our guys. There's also a sense that, you know - who are these snail eaters to tell us what to do?\n\nSHAPIRO: Which is so funny because American political leaders have also criticized these companies for trying to dodge taxes by being located in countries like Ireland in the first place.\n\nKLEINBARD: Exactly. But there is one other thing going on, which is that the U.S. Treasury Department is smarter than this. The U.S. Treasury Department put out a large policy paper last week in which it came to the defense of Apple, and in part it's because of just political - the same kind of political considerations. But it's also because there's a tax agenda underneath the surface.\n\nU.S. companies have been so successful at this stateless income game mostly at the expense of Europe that they have well over $2 trillion in super low-taxed foreign earnings that have not been taxed in the United States, essentially taxed nowhere in the world.\n\nAnd what the United States is playing for is that when it comes time for corporate tax reform, there will be a one-time tax charge on all of those offshore earnings as part of the transition to the new system. Let's call it 10 percent. Well, 10 percent of $2 trillion is $200 billion of free tax revenue.\n\nSHAPIRO: Oh, so if this is revenue that has been taxed in Europe according to this court ruling, then it is revenue that the U.S. cannot someday in the future tax once this reform gets implemented.\n\nKLEINBARD: Essentially That's exactly right.\n\nSHAPIRO: Is there any chance of this bringing business back to the United States?\n\nKLEINBARD: No (laughter). You know, Apple is a really interesting example of this. Today in its press conferences and two years ago in Tim Cook's testimony before the Senate - tried to make the point that the real brains of the operation of Apple, the real drivers of its profitability are its software engineers in Cupertino. Well, if that were true...\n\nSHAPIRO: Then they should be taxed at California tax rates.\n\nKLEINBARD: Well, they should be taxed today, exactly, on the current basis by the United States. Apple is trying to have it both ways. On the one hand, they want to tell Europe that profits are really because of the genius of the American operations, and they want to tell the United States that the operations are really located outside the United States.\n\nThe pincer movement is forcing the essential incompatibility of these different stories to the fore. But this is not about real jobs. This is about shifting of profits through paper transactions.\n\nSHAPIRO: Edward Kleinbard, professor of business and law at USC, thanks very much.\n\nKLEINBARD: Thank you, Sir.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR.

In Diabetes Fight, Lifestyle Changes Prove Hard To Come By In Mexico\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Meghan Dhaliwal/for NPR Meghan Dhaliwal/for NPR\n\nLet's say you'd like to go for a run in Mexico City.\n\nDr. Tonatiuh Barrientos, an epidemiologist with Mexico's National Institute of Public Health, thinks that's a good idea — in theory. An expert on diabetes, he'd like to see more people in the Mexican capital get out and exercise to combat the disease.\n\nBut as a runner himself, he knows that Mexico City isn't an easy place to jog. In a metropolis of 22 million, there are only a handful of parks where people can run.\n\nLook, this is a fairly crowded street. It's a pretty noisy street. It's polluted, Barrientos says walking through the Tlalpan neighborhood that lies between his office and his home. Now just imagine trying to convince yourself to get out there and run.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Meghan Dhaliwal/for NPR Meghan Dhaliwal/for NPR\n\nIt's a tough sell. I mean the only place for you to really run is on the sidewalk. You can't run on the street because you'll probably get run over, he says.\n\nThe sidewalk is an uneven mix of broken cement slabs and cobblestones. Street vendors have set up little tables and carts to sell everything from electrical supplies to fried pork cracklings.\n\nThere are so many people that it's hard to even walk at a fast clip.\n\nAnd if you do manage to find a stretch of sidewalk, the elevation in Mexico City combined with the smog and the chances of getting mugged make running a hard thing to get excited about.\n\nThere are a lot of obstacles, Barrientos says as he dodges his way past low-hanging awnings. And you need to deal with that if you wanted to try to run here.\n\nProfessionally, Barrientos has tracked the slow, steady rise in Type 2 diabetes in Mexico. Roughly 14 million Mexicans are now living with diabetes — nearly triple the number who had the disease in 1990.\n\nBarrientos says for too long health officials considered it the responsibility of patients to change their diet and exercise routines. They either did it or didn't. He says now it's become clear that addressing one of Mexico's biggest health crises requires changes at a much higher level and includes lobbying for healthier public spaces where people can easily get out and exercise.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Meghan Dhaliwal/for NPR Meghan Dhaliwal/for NPR\n\nHow do we change the world so that making healthy decisions is a lot easier than it is right now? he asks.\n\nDiabetes has mushroomed as Mexicans' lifestyles have changed dramatically over the last 40 years. Several generations ago diabetes was almost unheard of in Mexico. Now it's the leading cause of death, according to the World Health Organization. Mexicans with indigenous ancestry have a genetic predisposition for the condition that makes them even more likely to develop it than Caucasians. But a key driver of Type 2 diabetes in Mexico — and globally — is still a person's diet.\n\nBarrientos says current projections show that by 2030, 17 percent of all Mexican adults will have diabetes.\n\nAnd that of course opens a lot of questions about sustainability, he says. Can you really sustain a public health system with 17 percent of your population being diabetic? Especially if you are not prepared to control that diabetes.\n\nSome epidemiologists predict that by 2050, half the adults in the country could suffer from diabetes in their lifetime.\n\nType 2 diabetes can be reversed with weight-loss surgery in some cases. Uncontrolled, the metabolic disorder can have grave health consequences. It can lead to blindness, nerve damage, kidney failure and, in some cases, foot amputations.\n\nBarrientos and others are now saying the focus of diabetes prevention in Mexico needs to shift away from shaming individuals to looking at new government policies to tackle this mounting health crisis.\n\nWith tobacco we faced the same thing for many, many years. We were trying to encourage people to quit: Because if you don't quit you're going to die! he says. The only time that we started to see real change was when we said, 'We are going to change the rules of the game.' The more expensive it is the less you're going to be willing to spend your precious money on something that isn't good for you.\n\ntoggle caption Meghan Dhaliwal/for NPR\n\nIn an effort to reduce soda consumption, the government in 2014 imposed a 1 peso per liter tax on sugar sweetened beverages, the equivalent of about 10 U.S. cents on a standard 2 liter bottle.\n\nAt the time Mexico was the leading per capita consumer of soda in the world. In regulatory filings in 2015, Coca-Cola said that the annual consumption of its beverages in Mexico was more than 600 8-ounce servings per person per year. That means that, on average, every Mexican was drinking nearly two glasses of Coke beverages every day. And that doesn't even count the amount of Pepsi or other brands of soda being consumed.\n\nAlejandro Calvillo, the head of a consumer group called El Poder del Consumidor, says soda is making Mexicans sick.\n\nWalking just outside his office in Mexico City, he points out little shops selling Coke and junk food on just about every block. In fact, the red Coca-Cola logo has become a symbol that declares snack shop.\n\nCoke in Mexico has more than 1.5 million places that sell Coke, Calvillo says. The presence of these products is everywhere. Calvillo was one of the advocates behind the 2014 soda tax, although he would have liked the tax to have been even higher. A higher tax, he argues, would have pushed down consumption even more and given the government more resources to combat the lifestyle that's linked to diabetes. In indigenous communities in Chiapas, he says, parents put Coke in baby bottles for their infants and the government isn't doing anything. It's crazy.\n\nLike Barrientos, he says that if Mexico is going to successfully combat diabetes, the rules of the game need to change.\n\nHis efforts to get the soda tax increased even more, however, have so far been unsuccessful.\n\nBut Jorge Terrazas, the head of ANPRAC, the carbonated beverages trade association in Mexico City, says soda is unfairly blamed for Mexico's extremely high rates of obesity and diabetes.\n\nThere's not conclusive scientific evidence demonstrating the relation between the intake of soft drinks with overweight, he tells NPR.\n\nThe average Mexican's daily intake of calories far exceeds the World Health Organization recommendation of 2,000, and Terrazas says the majority of those calories are coming from things other than soda.\n\nBut anti-soda campaigners says sugar is a big part of the problem. They say calling for solutions that rely on individuals alone to change their lifestyles won't solve Mexico's diabetes crisis.\n\nBarrientos, the epidemiologist and runner, says the solution is going to require major changes to the way Mexicans live, eat and exercise.
FACT CHECK: Republican Candidates On Keeping Or Changing Social Security\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Wilfredo Lee/AP Wilfredo Lee/AP\n\nThis story is part of NPR's fact-checking series, Break it Down.\n\nFlorida, which holds its presidential primary on Tuesday, is home to more than 3 million seniors who rely on Social Security. At the GOP debate in Miami Thursday night, candidates were asked about their plans for the program.\n\nAll the Republican candidates say they want to leave Social Security as it is for people who are already retired, or soon will be. But Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have proposed changes for younger workers. Donald Trump says he wants to preserve Social Security benefits and is counting on stronger economic growth to help pay for that.\n\nThe Claims:\n\nDana Bash, CNN: According to the Social Security Administration, unless adjustments are made, Social Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years. Marco Rubio: Anyone who tells you Social Security can stay the way it is is lying. Any politician that goes around saying, 'We don't have to do anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is,' they're not being honest with you. Social Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it. So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents. For example, instead of retiring at 67 the way I'm supposed to retire, I'd have to retire at 68....If I've made a lot of money, my Social Security benefit will not grow a fast as someone who made less money. Ted Cruz: Social Security right now is careening towards insolvency, and it's irresponsible.....For younger workers, we need to change the rate of growth of benefits so it matches inflation instead of exceeding inflation. And as you noted Dana, we need to have for younger workers that a portion of your tax payments are in personal accounts like the 401(k) that you own, that you control, that you can pass on to your kids and grandkids. John Kasich: If you've had wealth throughout your lifetime, when the time comes to be on Social Security, you'll still get it. It will simply be less. And for those people who depend on that Social Security, they'll get their full benefit. Donald Trump: I will do everything in my power not to touch Social Security....I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it.\n\nThe Big Questions:\n\n1. How big is the hole in the Social Security safety net?\n\n2. What would it take to fix it?\n\nThe Short Answers:\n\n1. The question from CNN somewhat overstates the problem. Social Security won't run out of money in 20 years. What will happen — somewhere around 2035 — is the program will exhaust its Trust Fund, which Social Security uses to help supplement money from payroll taxes. Even after the trust fund is gone, payroll taxes paid by workers will continue to flow into the system, and those funds will be sufficient to cover about three-quarters of all retirement benefits. In other words, if nothing is done, future retirees could still expect to collect 75 cents for every dollar of Social Security they're owed. (Social Security has a separate program that pays disability benefits, and it faces a more urgent cash crunch. If money from the retirement program is diverted to back fill the disability program, the trust fund will be exhausted a few years earlier.)\n\n2. There are a number of ways to close the gap between the money Social Security expects to take in from payroll taxes (the sole source of revenue once the trust fund is exhausted) and what it's expected to pay out in retirement benefits. All of the fixes involve some combination of raising revenue and/or cutting benefits. If policy makers act now, the gap could be closed with relatively modest changes. The longer we wait, the larger the required changes will have to be. Some of the fixes proposed by the GOP candidates would help to narrow the gap, but none would close it altogether.\n\nThe Long Answers:\n\nThe basic challenge facing Social Security is demographic. The system relies on payroll taxes from people who are working to pay benefits to those who are retired. That worked well when there were four or five workers for every retiree. But that ratio has now dropped below three workers per retiree and it's drifting towards two. Absent another baby boom or a massive influx of immigrants, that's not likely to change.\n\nIf policy makers take no action, there will still be money coming in to Social Security from payroll taxes. It just won't be enough to cover all the benefits that retirees will be owed. (It will be enough to pay about 75 cents on the dollar.)\n\nClosing that gap will require cutting benefits, raising taxes, or some combination of the two.\n\nRubio's proposal: Marco Rubio suggests gradually raising the retirement age at which younger workers like himself become eligible for Social Security. This is effectively a cut in benefits, since retirees would have fewer years to collect. Raising the top retirement age from 67 to 70 as Rubio proposed would fill about one-third of the Social Security shortfall. Rubio also suggested a form of means testing, in which wealthier retirees would see smaller benefit increases in the future. The Senator didn't offer any details, but other means testing proposals have been estimated to reduce the funding shortfall by about 10 percent.\n\nCruz's proposal: Ted Cruz suggests a different form of benefit cut, in which future retirees would receive smaller cost-of-living adjustments. Some argue that the current inflation measure used by Social Security overstates the price increases seniors face, although others insist cost of living adjustments should be bigger, not smaller. The cut that Cruz suggests would fix about 15 percent of the funding shortfall. Cruz also proposes letting workers divert a portion of their payroll taxes into private retirement accounts. This may or may not be a good idea. It was hotly debated during the George W. Bush administration. But using payroll taxes for any purpose other than Social Security would make the system's solvency problems worse, not better.\n\nKasich's proposal: John Kasich also advocates means testing with reduced benefits for wealthy seniors.\n\nTrump's proposal: Donald Trump argues against any cut in benefits or increase in taxes, instead relying on faster economic growth to close the Social Security funding gap. Kathleen Romig of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says faster growth would help with this and many other challenges. But she warns it's not a magic bullet. Forecasters have tried to predict Social Security's fate under many different economic scenarios, and there's no realistic growth level that would close the funding gap on its own. Faster growth cuts both ways, increasing revenue from payroll taxes but also increasing benefits, which are tied to wages.\n\nRevenue proposals: None of the Republicans suggested raising payroll taxes, but that's another way policymakers could help to close the funding gap. Payroll taxes for Social Security are currently 12.4 percent, split between employers and employees. Raising that rate to about 15 percent would close the funding gap entirely. (There's a separate, 2.9 percent payroll tax for Medicare.) Alternatively, policymakers could apply the payroll tax to more income. Wages and salaries above $117,000 a year are currently exempt from Social Security taxes. If that cap were eliminated, it would solve about 90 percent of the funding gap.\n\nAny of these fixes can be thought of as items on a menu, to be mixed, matched, and combined in whatever way is most politically palatable. By acting now, policymakers could solve the Social Security gap with a relatively modest increase in taxes and modest adjustments to benefits. With each passing year of inaction, though, the gap to be filled gets larger.
Utah Voters Approved Medicaid Expansion, But State Lawmakers Are Balking\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Cory Dinter/KUER Cory Dinter/KUER\n\nUtah residents may have thought they were done fighting about Medicaid expansion last November. But when Utah lawmakers opened a new legislative session in late January, they began pushing through a bill to roll back the scope and impact of an expansion that voters approved by in a ballot measure.\n\nWe voted for this on Nov. 6. We were very clear about what we wanted, says Andrew Roberts, a spokesman for Utah Decides, the group that organized the Medicaid expansion referendum, known as Proposition 3.\n\nThe voter-approved measure would extend coverage to 150,000 uninsured people in the state.\n\nWe are frustrated, and I think Utahns are frustrated, Roberts says.\n\nHe's so frustrated that his group hired a billboard truck to drive in circles around the Capitol building and through the snowy streets of Salt Lake City and its suburbs. Signs on the sides of the truck flash phrases in LED lights, including Support democracy. Support Utah's vote. A looping video advertisement urges residents to call lawmakers who don't respect the will of the people.\n\nAfter six years of talking about Medicaid expansion, voters approved the ballot measure on Nov. 6, with 53 percent in favor. But the issue erupted again when the legislative session started Jan. 28.\n\nSimilar legislative efforts to curtail expansion are also happening in Idaho, where voters passed a Medicaid expansion initiative in November. Sixty-one percent of voters were in favor. Idaho lawmakers are considering ways to scale that program back.\n\nIn politically and fiscally conservative Utah, legislators argue the 0.15 percent non-food sales tax that voters approved won't be enough to pay for Medicaid expansion. So they'll pass an expansion, but only a very limited one.\n\nVoters wanted Medicaid expansion and that's what we're doing, says Republican state Sen. Allen Christensen. But, he adds, the voters didn't fill in the proper blanks. We are filling in those blanks for them. They are not obligated to balance the budget. We are.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Cory Dinter/KUER Cory Dinter/KUER\n\nChristensen is leading the rollback effort in Utah. His alternative proposal, SB 96, would cap the number of individuals who would qualify for Medicaid, add work requirements and lower the annual income limit. Prop. 3 supporters had wanted the coverage available for people who made up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $16,000 a year. But Christensen's bill would offer Medicaid coverage only to people who made less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $12,000 for an individual.\n\nMaking those changes would require the state of Utah to get approval for two federal waivers from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Proposition supporters point out that similar requests from other states have been denied.\n\nFrom the perspective of voters, I think voters have a right to be furious right now, says Matt Slonaker, executive director of the Utah Health Policy Project, another group that has supported Medicaid expansion.\n\nSlonaker says changing the scope of Prop. 3 would mean fewer people getting health coverage, and the state would receive less money from the federal government. He also fears it could make voters feel disillusioned.\n\nWhy would voters ever want to pursue ballot initiatives and direct democracy if the legislature's just going to repeal it anyway? Slonaker asks.\n\nWhile some Utah lawmakers, such as Christensen, describe being philosophically opposed to Medicaid expansion, much of the political debate in Utah is about how much expansion will cost, and whether the new sales tax will pay for it. Supporters point to the fiscal experience of other states.\n\nYou should think of Medicaid expansion as no different than if you said, 'Oh, hey, somebody's going to go open up a factory, says Bryce Ward, an economist at the University of Montana, in Missoula. And that factory is going to bring, in the case of Montana, $600 million of outside money into the state that we're going to pay to workers here.\n\nWard recently published a report on the economic impacts of Medicaid expansion in Montana during the first two years of that program. He says it brought in about $600 million dollars in new funds to the state per year. That money supported about 6,000 jobs, he adds, or about $350 million in additional income for residents.\n\nWard says states like his also can take advantage of savings, because Medicaid expansion makes providing health care to certain groups, like prisoners, more affordable. While states do have to pay 10 percent of the cost of expanded Medicaid (the federal government covers 90 percent — a more generous match than traditional Medicaid), the combination of savings and economic growth meant that, in the case of Montana, the program basically pays for itself, Ward says.\n\nThe benefits that people in Utah have is that people like me in other states have done the work trying to figure this out, he says. Or at least get some ballpark estimates of it.\n\nSo far, Utah lawmakers remain unconvinced by studies like Ward's. The bill to restrict Medicaid expansion is moving fast, and could reach the governor's desk as soon as next week.\n\nThis story is part of NPR's reporting partnership with KUER and Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation that is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.
The Republican Party After Trump\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nJust a few months ago, the Republican Party had lost the presidency but won millions of votes, including gains among Black and Latino voters, gained seats in Congress and controlled more state legislatures. Now the president they promoted and assisted is widely unpopular for lying and inciting insurrection. The identity of the Republican Party is tied up with white supremacists.\n\nWhat is the Republican Party now? Well, we'll ask Ryan Costello, former conservative Republican and congressman who represented Pennsylvania's 6th District, who joins us now. Mr. Costello, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nRYAN COSTELLO: Great to be with you.\n\nSIMON: I feel like I have to put it this bluntly. Has the party of Lincoln and Frederick Douglass and Ed Brooke become the party of the Proud Boys and Confederate flags and racism?\n\nCOSTELLO: Well, you know, I certainly don't want that. And I think the predominantly overwhelming majority of Republicans don't believe that sort of hateful ideology, don't subscribe to it, don't want anything to do with it and certainly don't want the party of Lincoln to be branded that way.\n\nSIMON: But before you go on, Washington Post/ABC poll says nearly 6 in 10 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say they want to follow Trump's lead.\n\nCOSTELLO: Sure. And in fairness, I saw a poll today that - where those numbers may have gone down a little bit, but your point is a good one, and that is notwithstanding just how absolutely horrible and how much of a stain last week was on the history of our country and the president's role in it. And I think that it's one thing to speak about tax cuts and regulatory reform and speak to the ideological pillars that the party has been known for. It's another thing when the rhetoric and sort of, frankly, you know, the offensiveness of things that he would say from time to time points in such a manner that it leads to violence.\n\nSIMON: From your point of view, Mr. Costello, does the Republican Party need to renounce Donald Trump?\n\nCOSTELLO: Well, if you don't renounce, if you don't point out where he was wrong in very clear and explicit terms, you are destined to be a minority party, and people that were voters who would ordinarily support your legislative agenda or, even more broadly speaking, your governing philosophy are going to say, if you can't do the most basic and commonsense thing, then I can't support you.\n\nAnd some things in this country are even more fundamental than one's governing philosophy. They relate to the rule of law. They relate to the separation of power. It relates to the peaceful and orderly transition of power. And if you can't get those basic building blocks of our democracy and the notion of being self-governed in a republic, then voters are really not going to have time to hear the nitty-gritty on your policy details. And that's - I think that that's where we are at this moment, to be totally frank with you.\n\nSIMON: And - well, I have to ask, Mr. Costello, and I know polls can go up and down, but if more than half of the people who identify themselves as Republicans say the party ought to support Donald Trump, after all that's happened, he's still a Republican. Can you ask people to vote for the Republican label?\n\nCOSTELLO: Interestingly - you know, I'm sure listeners have heard the term RINO - right? - Republican in name only. Well, a RINO used to be somebody who would be registered Republican but often vote with Democrats or vote not aligned with the majority of Republicans. In the past four years, RINO has essentially meant not doing whatever Donald Trump wants you to do or saying something critical of Donald Trump - has nothing to do with ideology - right? - which is totally ridiculous to me.\n\nBut to your question, I am a Republican, but I'm not a Republican - and I don't think we want Republicans, just like we don't want Democrats who are unwilling to be critical of those in their party who have done or said things that are wrong, nor do we want a Republican or Democrat just to vote the party line.\n\nSIMON: I think the word reckoning is much overused, but as far as you're concerned, does the Republican Party need to go through a reckoning with its soul and ask, how could this happen?\n\nCOSTELLO: Yes, it does. And the part that bothers me so much is that when somebody says something offensive, whether it's the president or someone else, you know, not saying that's wrong, not cleaning it up allows those who are offended by it to think that that's what the party stands for.\n\nTo me, every American is entitled to certain inalienable rights. And if we are judging folks by things other than just them being a human being, then that's a problem. And I think the flip side for Republicans that gets Democrats in trouble is when we just focus on identity politics, which, to me, is very cancerous in our society. But we're not able to have that debate if we have people storming the Capitol with Confederate flags and saying and doing things on social media that are just outright hateful. It disgusts me. And you can't play to that. You have to outright reject it. And you have to say, I'm not interested in your support. I don't want your support. And if you can't say that clearly and quickly, then people are going to assume the worst.\n\nAnd so it is normally the case that a political party has a reckoning when a president loses after their first term. You know, the party has to look inward. They have to decide what they're going to be based on moving forward. And that's where I think we'll be.\n\nSIMON: Ryan Costello is a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania. Thanks so much, sir.\n\nCOSTELLO: Thank you very much. Take care.\n\nCopyright © 2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

Even Before Hurricane Maria Hit, Puerto Rico Was In Financial Ruin\n\nNPR and PBS's FRONTLINE have investigated the devastating toll of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico and how the federal response, Wall Street and a century of colonial neglect left 3.5 million Americans struggling to survive.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nIt was early morning last September 20 when Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, leaving a trail of death and destruction. In the months that followed, we've heard a lot about how the storm crippled the island, leaving millions without power, food and water. Now, over the next two days, we're going to take a deeper look at where things went wrong before and after the storm. NPR and the PBS show FRONTLINE have spent the last seven months investigating, and today they reveal a disaster that began long before Maria, a decade of Wall Street dealing that made millions for banks while the island teetered on the edge of financial collapse.\n\nToday NPR's Laura Sullivan reports on how a once-prosperous island ended up in financial ruin, unable to prepare for the storm that was to come.\n\nLAURA SULLIVAN, BYLINE: Long before Maria you probably knew Puerto Rico was in financial trouble. The story went something like this - Puerto Rico borrowed way too much money over the years, overspent that money, and now it can't pay any of it back. And then there was this other story that tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans lost their savings. But what hasn't made much sense is what one thing had to do with the other.\n\nIf Iowa or California borrowed money and defaulted, you wouldn't expect people living in Iowa or California to lose their money, too. And what was more unusual, Puerto Rico imploded over municipal bonds. They're supposed to be the most boring, safe financial investments out there. You buy a Puerto Rican bond, Puerto Rico pays you back later with interest.\n\nCATE LONG: It's bizarre, OK? It's really bizarre.\n\nSULLIVAN: I asked a Wall Street analyst named Cate Long what she thought of this.\n\nLONG: Governments don't collapse like that. And, yeah, there was hundreds of people looking at this, and nobody saw it. This is like - I mean, look at it from the outside. Yeah, this is a crazy story, man.\n\nSULLIVAN: It did seem crazy. Could Puerto Rico really destroy its own financial interests all by itself, or were there other players who may have had their own interests? Down in San Juan, I stop by the nonprofit Center for a New Economy to get some of the backstory. The center's policy director studies the island's finances.\n\nSERGIO MARXUACH: My name is Sergio Marxuach.\n\nSULLIVAN: Say your last name again.\n\nMARXUACH: Marx like Karl Marx...\n\nSULLIVAN: Marx.\n\nMARXUACH: ...And swatch like the watch.\n\nSULLIVAN: Marxuach said that for decades Puerto Rico was booming. It had the special tax break that lured pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers to the island. But then in 1996, Congress began phasing it out. Within a decade, the island spun into recession and to compensate borrowed money.\n\nMARXUACH: The government was borrowing at an incredible clip. Some years the debt would increase by 15 percent year over year.\n\nSULLIVAN: How much percent?\n\nMARXUACH: Fifteen.\n\nSULLIVAN: It's easy to fault Puerto Rican politicians for this. Why didn't they just cut spending, cut school budgets and police budgets and whatever else? But you could ask every voter the same question - who do you like better, the politician who takes away all your favorite programs and gives you nothing, or the one who tells you can have everything you want and someone else will pay for it 20 years from now? Puerto Ricans chose the latter. They turned to investment banks to come in and put the bond deals together.\n\nMARXUACH: All they do is act as intermediaries. They find buyers.\n\nSULLIVAN: Usually that's pension funds, your retirement account or their own clients.\n\nMARXUACH: That's what they get their fees for essentially. And then they're off. They are not on the hook.\n\nSULLIVAN: So it's not their money...\n\nMARXUACH: No.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...That's at stake here.\n\nMARXUACH: Yeah. So they don't care.\n\nSULLIVAN: Puerto Rico bonds had perks and in theory should have been safe. Governments rarely go broke. Yes, there was Detroit. But Puerto Rico has as many residents as almost half the states in the country. The last time a state defaulted was 1933 in Arkansas.\n\nMARXUACH: Fund managers, they will not admit this now, but when Puerto Rico was selling debt like pancakes, they loved Puerto Rico debt. Since they had slightly higher interest rates and no taxes attached to them, you immediately look like a genius, right? You just bump up the entire return for the entire portfolio. So that's your bonus, right? That's your new Mercedes, your new yacht.\n\nSULLIVAN: Has anybody come forward from inside these banks to talk about what was really going on?\n\nMARXUACH: No. No. It's a very close-knit world in Wall Street. And the tendency is just to keep quiet and keep working.\n\nSULLIVAN: I went in search of that close-knit world. I found more than a dozen bankers and brokers involved in Puerto Rican bonds. They described a fast pace of moneymaking and competition and Puerto Rican politicians eager for an influx of cash. And then one afternoon, I found someone deep on the inside, a former top manager for the largest broker-dealer on the island, UBS. Carlos Capacete said he got his start in Puerto Rico's Golden Mile in the 1980s.\n\nCARLOS CAPACETE: All the major banks in New York would come to Puerto Rico on a regular basis to pitch deals. Listen; we can do an additional 200 million, additional 500 million. They make commissions. They make fees. This is kind of like a money-making machine. As long as there are transactions coming and going, they're making a ton of money.\n\nSULLIVAN: Capacete said he said that was all great until about 2011, when he and other bankers started realizing what many bond investors hadn't yet figured out - Puerto Rico was in trouble. There was too much debt. And this is where you might expect UBS and other banks to stop with the bond deals, stop pitching Puerto Rico bonds and stop selling Puerto Rican bonds to their clients. But the opposite happened. Capacete said when it came to clients, UBS pushed brokers to sell.\n\nCAPACETE: There were some hard-line tactics to sell the funds, you know, like go out and get them. Let's go. You got to sell these funds. They were just trying to push the bond funds to whoever had a heartbeat.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nSULLIVAN: There's an audio tape secretly recorded at a UBS meeting in Puerto Rico that's now part of lawsuits. You can hear a top company manager telling brokers to sell the bonds or...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Go home. Get a new job.\n\nSULLIVAN: These bonds were specifically designed to sell to Puerto Ricans. They were part of special bond funds that were far riskier than what regulators allow on the mainland. Brokers sold tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans into these special funds. Hundreds of millions of dollars of the island's wealth was now highly concentrated at the worst possible time. And then Capacete heard a troubling story.\n\nCAPACETE: One day this client tells me, are you aware of what they're doing in this other branch? And I said, tell me. And he told me the scheme.\n\nSULLIVAN: Capacete said he says he learned some brokers were pushing Puerto Rican clients who had already put so much of their retirement or savings into the special funds to go borrow money and put it into the funds, too. It's like using poker chips to take out a loan for more poker chips and betting them all on the same hand.\n\nCAPACETE: It's unethical. It's against the bank's regulations. And it puts the clients in a really, really tough risk situation.\n\nSULLIVAN: Capacete sent emails warning UBS. Almost a year later, two officers from the bank's compliance office came and said they found no evidence of the practice.\n\nCAPACETE: And I jumped up and I said, you're kidding, right? This is a joke. And I told her, look at the big accounts and follow the money. I left the room, and I don't think I ever spoke to them again.\n\nSULLIVAN: Why do you think the bank would want to turn a blind eye to something like this?\n\nCAPACETE: Because it was profitable. And I was the one that was - in Spanish we say (speaking Spanish). I was the one that was spoiling their party.\n\nSULLIVAN: UBS declined NPR and FRONTLINE's requests for an interview but said its loan terms were fully disclosed, and that the program as a whole did not violate financial regulations. It pointed to a separate case where regulators found it didn't mislead clients and called Capacete a disgruntled former employee who has sued the bank, and said it fired the one employee who had been violating policies.\n\nEventually, federal regulators investigated and found the bank should have had a system in place to prevent the practice. They fined UBS $34 million for the loan scheme and other problems. They also fined UBS and four other banks for putting clients at risk in the special funds. Eighteen hundred UBS customers have now sued.\n\nBut in 2013, the party came to an end for investors. Bond prices tanked. All of those tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans tied up in the same risky funds were in serious trouble, and those that had taken out additional loans suddenly had to cover them. Within months, billions of dollars of Puerto Rican wealth was wiped out.\n\nAnd surely by now the government and banks would want to be done with this Puerto Rican bond business. Rating agencies downgraded Puerto Rican bonds to junk. I asked Puerto Rico's current governor, Ricardo Rossello, what he thought of this period, and he put it this way.\n\nRICARDO ROSSELLO: The governor of Puerto Rico was run as a big Ponzi scheme. What you had was essentially a black box of a government running that had no clarity as to what was being borrowed and what was being spent.\n\nSULLIVAN: But in 2014, cable news was ablaze. The banks in Puerto Rico were going in for another bond deal.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Demand for Puerto Rico's debt was through the roof.\n\nSULLIVAN: It was the largest municipal junk bond offering in U.S. history.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: This deal I believe is a $3 1/2 billion deal. So we're up...\n\nSULLIVAN: Puerto Rican officials for their part told me they needed the cash to make payroll. But when I went back to the bankers I had met, several of whom had worked on the deal, they told me something else. They said this bond was more than just a bond deal. They said it was also an exit strategy for the banks. See; in the years before the bond, the banks had been loaning Puerto Rico money or making investments in other ways. Government documents show hundreds of millions of dollars were now at stake on an island in financial trouble.\n\nAnd dig deep into the 2014 bond documents, and you'll see it, too. Almost a quarter of the entire bond goes to pay them back, almost $900 million that didn't go to Puerto Ricans or even to keep the government afloat but went to pay back loans, pay fees or eliminate other risk of banks directly involved in putting the deal together. Barclays, which led the bond deal, got almost half a billion dollars; Banco Santander, 100 million; JPMorgan, 74 million; Morgan Stanley, 24 million; and others.\n\nNeither Barclays nor any of the other banks would agree to an interview. In statements, banks said they fully disclosed their financial stake in the deal and did not influence how Puerto Rico used the money. Morgan Stanley said they also extended Puerto Rico $250 million in credit after the bond. It was difficult to find bank insiders to talk on the record about this. And then I found one former broker who would.\n\nAXEL RIVERA: I started back in 1983 in Wall Street.\n\nSULLIVAN: I met Axel Rivera in a hotel lobby in San Juan. He was at Morgan Stanley when the record 2014 deal was done. As he flipped through the bond, he said when the island got closer to default, banks were getting nervous. They had too much debt on the island.\n\nRIVERA: They wanted to try to get as much as they could of their exposure out of their books.\n\nSULLIVAN: Your colleagues at Morgan Stanley...\n\nRIVERA: Yes.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...Told you...\n\nRIVERA: Yes.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...That they had exposure to risk at that time.\n\nRIVERA: That they had much more than what they wanted, and they needed to unwind that.\n\nSULLIVAN: And they needed the 2014 bond...\n\nRIVERA: That's correct.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...To get them out. Then who gets left paying the bill?\n\nRIVERA: The bondholders, whomever they are. The banks get out, and everybody else gets - they get stuck with the bill.\n\nSULLIVAN: Rivera said for banks like Morgan Stanley and others, the bond was the finale, capping years of profit with a way out.\n\nRIVERA: Most of the general public didn't understand what was going on. The darkness of this bond deal made a lot of people in Wall Street happy, but it was immoral in many ways.\n\nSULLIVAN: Fifteen months later, the then-governor announced the island couldn't pay any of its debt. It was broke. The bond funds crashed, savings, retirements, pensions gone. The government started closing hospitals. There was no money to shore up bridges or electrical grids. And then - well, you know what happened next. A Category 4 hurricane came barreling into Puerto Rico. If ever this island needed the federal government to come and bring its A-game, now was the time. What it got was anything but.

Planning For Your Retirement: Understanding Annuities\n\nAn annuity can be a very smart retirement investment for many people. That's not just because an annuity can provide a secure revenue stream — a monthly check — for the rest of your life, no matter how long you live. On top of that, the longer you live, the more you get what's called a mortality credit as you outlive other people who bought into the annuity. The income gain from that can be many times greater than any other secure investment you're likely to find.\n\nBut annuities can also be overpriced, opaque, terrible products, too. So how do you figure out if an annuity is right for you? And if you think it is, how do you buy a good one that's not an overpriced turkey with massive hidden fees?\n\nTo help explain this, we called on Kent Smetters, an economist and professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. He's an expert on personal finance and he's written extensively about annuities in particular.\n\nWhat is an annuity?\n\nA lifetime, or fixed, annuity pays you a constant amount of money until you die, sometimes called longevity protection. Since no one knows how long they'll live, a fixed annuity is similar to Social Security, except most lifetime annuity payments are not indexed to inflation. Overall, it's a very simple product.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Kent Smetters Courtesy of Kent Smetters\n\nIn contrast, a variable annuity is a very complicated product and, as commonly used, provides very little, if any, longevity protection. Instead, variable annuity sellers tout their tax benefits, but these benefits are often overstated and can even lead to higher taxes in some circumstances.\n\nWhat is a deferred annuity?\n\nYou can buy an annuity in two forms: an immediate or deferred. Both forms protect you from outliving your retirement savings. An immediate annuity means that you pay a lump-sum amount of cash, usually at retirement, and immediately start receiving annuity payments. A deferred annuity means that you pay for it, often while working, long before you start receiving annuity payments. Due to recent legal changes, you'll soon be allowed to buy deferred annuities through 401(k) plans.\n\nThe main advantage of buying annuities on a deferred basis is that you can often lock in annuity payment rates today, well before you retire, when your rates can be different. You can also buy a deferred annuity after you retire, for example, to start at age 80, after you think that you will have exhausted your other resources.\n\nIf you can afford to live well without the income from the immediate annuity, you are better off with the deferred annuity because it provides greater tax benefits and increased longevity protection.\n\nHow does someone figure out if an annuity makes sense?\n\n1) For an annuity to make sense, you should ideally have saved up in excess of $500,000 in today's dollars for retirement. That's because $250,000 is the amount a couple retiring today should have ready for out-of-pocket medical expenses, even if they are on Medicare, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute and NetBenefits. The other $250,000 is a cushion for other things that might come up.\n\n2) Think about buying a fixed annuity for the rest of your money. Once you have met your $500,000 goal, start investing in deferred annuities, especially if you are still working. If you are retired, purchase immediate annuities with the rest.\n\n3) Base your standard consumption on the monies from the lifetime annuity plus Social Security.\n\n4) If 3) is not enough for monthly expenses, think about reducing expenses. If not, repeat step 1) with $250,000 as your target.\n\nAnnuities seem more complicated than just buying, say, an index fund. How do you shop around and make sure you're getting a fair deal on an annuity?\n\nIn general, most people should avoid variable annuities because they have high costs and their tax benefits are often overstated. But true lifetime fixed annuities do make a lot of sense, if one can avoid the large commission loads. In essence, they help replace the former pension plans. Be patient and shop around. I would get quotes from several leading annuity providers: MassMutual, MetLife, New York Life, State Farm, TIAA (if you qualify). Look for a firm with an A.M. Best Company rating of at least A+, the best being A++. IncomeSolutions.com provides quotes with low commissions for some other companies.\n\nAre there other risks to consider?\n\nMost states have programs that will guarantee your annuity payments if you insurer (the company that sold you the annuity) goes bust. The insurer cannot legally discuss these programs with you, and so you must investigate your own state rules. However, I don't have great confidence in these guarantees. Still, the risk of outliving your assets is much larger than the risk of you losing money because a major insurance company that sold you an annuity goes bankrupt. And you can reduce your risk by purchasing multiple annuity contracts across several companies.\n\nWhat if someone has less than $250,000 saved up? They just can't afford an annuity?\n\n5) If you really can't annuitize anything, live on Social Security plus 3 percent of your beginning assets each year (4 percent if you are quite unhealthy). For example, if a person enters retirement with $200,000 in assets, they will need to adjust their consumption to hit Social Security plus $6,000 per year. If they consume more money than that, they risk running out of everything but Social Security, which has its own problems.\n\nTo educate people about how to save and invest more successfully, Smetters hosts a radio show, Your Money, on Sirius XM which, along with his website KentOnMoney.com, he does pro bono. As part of NPR's Your Money and Your Life series, we asked Smetters for tips on finding a financial adviser.
Why It's So Hard To Know Whether School Choice Is Working\n\nEnlarge this image LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos has been a passionate proponent of expanding school choice, including private school vouchers and charter schools, and she has the clear backing of President Trump. But does the research justify her enthusiasm?\n\nExperts say one single, overarching issue bedevils their efforts to study the impact of school choice programs. That is: It's hard to disentangle the performance of a school from the selection of its students.\n\nStudents are never randomly assigned to a school. A school's population is always affected by local demographics. With schools of choice, by definition, parents and students are making a decision to attend that school, so their enrollment is even less random.\n\nEven when researchers carefully match students at different schools based on demographics, it's possible that families that are more organized and more invested in education are also more likely to seek out charters and voucher programs. Or, selection bias can also work the other way: The students who struggle in traditional public schools may be more likely to seek alternatives.\n\nFurther complicating matters is this: By law, most charter schools must have open enrollment, using a lottery if they have more applicants than spots. However, charters, and private schools, have sometimes been accused of using strict discipline rules or other measures to filter out underperforming or otherwise undesirable students.\n\nThe admissions policies of voucher-accepting private schools can also vary widely, depending on school policy and state law. Some must have open enrollment. Others retain the right to select students based on religion, academic achievement, artistic talent, conduct, or other factors.\n\nAnd, no matter where you look, both private schools and charters tend to enroll fewer students with disabilities compared with public schools, a practice known as creaming.\n\nSo, with the huge caveat that it's difficult to do an apples-to-apples comparison, where do researchers agree on the impact of choice?\n\nChoice programs seem to push nearby public schools to improve.\n\nThe results are consistent, and I don't think there's any debate, says Douglas Harris of the Education Research Alliance at Tulane University. Charters, vouchers and tax credits create competition and positive spillovers. When school choices expand, public schools stand to lose students, and thus money, and they seem to respond by stepping up their game.\n\nMartin Carnoy, a professor at Stanford University who has been studying the issue for decades, terms this response to competition an accountability effect. In other words, When you announce that there's a new sheriff in town, all of a sudden everybody perks up.\n\nCarnoy's studies of cities including Milwaukee argue that this effect fades over time.\n\nThere's far less agreement among researchers on the effects of choice for the students who choose to leave their traditional public school.\n\nFirst, charter schools. Charter students in city centers tend to do better than their public-school peers, according to the most recent research by the Center for Research on Education Outcomes at Stanford. But charter students elsewhere tend to do the same or worse.\n\nAnd the learning progress of nearly 200,000 students enrolled in 100-percent online virtual charter schools is generally so bad that representatives of the charter sector recently called for states to close many of them.\n\nSecond, private schools. Whether students are using vouchers or tax-credit scholarships, their academic outcomes are a similarly mixed bag.\n\nMost studies find modestly positive or neutral impact on student scores, and that's generally limited to African-American students in large urban centers, says Micah Ann Wixom, a policy analyst with the Education Commission of the States.\n\nMartin Carnoy wrote for the left-leaning Economic Policy institute in February: Extensive research on educational vouchers in the United States over the past 25 years shows that gains in student achievement are at best small.\n\nDo voucher students perform better than they would have in their neighborhood school? asks Josh Cunningham, a senior education policy specialist with the National Conference of State Legislatures. At the most I can say, 'Maybe, a little bit.' But there's not a lot of evidence that they'll have any substantial academic gains.\n\nOr, as the Center on Education Policy underscored in its 2011 survey of voucher research: Achievement gains for voucher students are similar to those of their public school peers.\n\nBut more recent research has found that private schools, like charter schools, can actually hurt the academic progress of the students who choose them. Studies of programs in Louisiana, Ohio and Washington, D.C., found students who left for private schools did worse, not better, compared with their peers.\n\nScholarship tax-credit programs, like voucher programs, send students to private schools. Their impact is hard to determine, says Harris of the Education Research Alliance.\n\nThe best-case scenario seems to be a slight positive effect, but most people would interpret it as no effect, he says.\n\nFinally, when it comes to voucher and tax-credit programs, many states don't even require private schools to administer the state's test. In Florida, it can be any nationally normed test. So these programs are a bit of a black box. Going forward, if private school options expand, we may know less and less about the schools that more and more students are attending.\n\nOh, and there's another challenge: Most of these analyses rely on test scores alone. Test scores provide an imperfect and incomplete picture of student performance, as the most recent reauthorization of the federal education law acknowledges.
Democratic Candidates Storm Storm Lake\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nDemocratic presidential hopefuls are in heartland America this weekend, making their case to rural voters in the small town of Storm Lake, Iowa. It's part of a broader push by Democrats to make inroads in traditionally Republican strongholds ahead of the 2020 election. NPR's Don Gonyea was there.\n\nDON GONYEA, BYLINE: This is northwest Iowa - deep red Republican country. But yesterday the stage was set for a group of Democrats for something billed as the Heartland Forum. There is an increasingly crowded field of Democrats in the race for president. Four of those officially running accepted the invite to attend.\n\nIt was not a debate. The candidates took turns on stage taking questions from a trio of journalists and from the audience. There was Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Amy Klobuchar, former cabinet secretary and San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro and former Congressman John Delaney. Warren was first on stage. In an opening statement, she tackled small-farm economics and the impact of big corporate farming and ag industry mergers.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF HEARTLAND FORUM)\n\nELIZABETH WARREN: You've got these giant corporations that are making bigger and bigger profits for themselves, for their executives, for their investors. And they're putting the squeeze on family farms, on small farms.\n\nGONYEA: When Amy Klobuchar, who's from neighboring Minnesota, took the stage, she said anti-trust laws need to be rewritten to protect small farms. She talked about President Trump's trade policies, tariffs he imposed against China and the retaliatory tariffs by the Chinese on U.S. farm commodities.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF HEARTLAND FORUM)\n\nAMY KLOBUCHAR: We've had a situation of the weather being bad. We've had some of the lowest profits for agriculture - at least in my state - since the 1980s. And I know that Iowa is experiencing this too. And while I'm glad that the administration decided to get that 12 billion set aside to make up for these trade wars, that's not the same as actually selling things, right?\n\nGONYEA: Now to Julian Castro, he was asked about balancing environmental concerns with farming. He said it's about the choices the government makes in the tax code and on where to invest.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF HEARTLAND FORUM)\n\nJULIAN CASTRO: Family farms can thrive and that you can have clean air and clean water no matter where you live, including in rural America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGONYEA: On immigration, Castro spoke of his grandmother coming to the U.S. from Mexico. The fourth candidate to speak was John Delaney of Maryland. He's still little-known, though he's been actively campaigning for almost two years already. Delaney spoke of his proposal, labeled the Heartland Fair Deal. In it, he too calls for much greater investment in rural areas.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF HEARTLAND FORUM)\n\nJOHN DELANEY: Capital has left this region. That doesn't mean people don't invest here. They do. But the owners of that capital are often not located here anymore like they used to be.\n\nGONYEA: Overall, the list of topics covered also included mental health, farmer suicides, climate change, rural school funding, student loan debt and more. Sixty-four-year-old Chris Petersen (ph) is a lifelong family farmer from Clear Lake, and he's a Democrat. He says the party needs to talk more about all of these things.\n\nCHRIS PETERSEN: Democratic Party, we got to talk about health care access. Rural hospitals are closing up. Everything is bad right now. And I tell you what. The Democrats need to stand up.\n\nGONYEA: Like some others, Petersen wishes more candidates had come but added that holding the event is a good sign that the party may pay more attention to rural America in the 2020 campaign.

Biden, Harris Promise 'Help Is On The Way' With COVID Relief Package\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPresident Biden and Vice President Harris spoke at the White House Rose Garden Friday afternoon in a ceremony celebrating the passage of the administration's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package earlier this week.\n\nThe joint event with congressional Democratic leaders marks the start of a concerted push by the White House to promote the American Rescue Plan around the country.\n\nIt's critical to demonstrate that government can function; can function and deliver prosperity, security and opportunity for the people of this country, Biden said during his remarks.\n\nBiden signed the bill Thursday, securing the first major legislative accomplishment of his term. The legislation includes direct payments, which Biden said would begin to go out as soon as this weekend, extended unemployment benefits and an expanded child tax credit. There's also billions of dollars set aside for schools, businesses and the expansion of the country's vaccine rollout. (Read more about the details here.)\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer attended, alongside a number of Democratic House and Senate committee chairs. Both Pelosi and Schumer praised committee leaders and members of their caucuses for getting the legislation passed, with Pelosi referring to House committee chairs as dazzling.\n\nOur unity on behalf of all the American people is what made this such a triumph, Pelosi said.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was also present, though he was one of the strongest backers of a provision in an earlier version of the legislation that would have increased the minimum wage to $15 by 2025. The proposed wage increase was ruled out by the Senate parliamentarian last month.\n\nBiden praised Sanders during his remarks, thanking him for making the case as to why this was so transformational and said the bill changes the paradigm on who benefits from major government legislation.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, this bill puts working people in this nation first, Biden said.\n\nThough Biden said Thursday that an overwhelming percentage of the American people support the package, no Republicans voted for the bill in the House or the Senate.\n\nFriday's ceremony kicked off a sort of victory lap during which Biden, Harris and their spouses will travel the country next week promoting the package.\n\nThe Help is Here tour will start on Monday, when Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff head to Las Vegas, while first lady Jill Biden visits Burlington, N.J. Other stops will include the Philadelphia suburbs, Atlanta and Denver.\n\nThis law is not the end of our efforts, though, Biden said. I view it as only the beginning.\n\nAccording to the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey, 62% of Americans approve of how Biden is handling the pandemic so far.
Trump Wants A Federal Hiring Freeze, But It May Not Save Money\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump rode to electoral victory in part on discontent with Washington. He promised to drain the swamp — referring to the nation's capital. And No. 2 on his Contract With The American Voter, listing activities for his first 100 days, is a hiring freeze on all civilian federal jobs that aren't involved in public safety or public health.\n\nA freeze is not unprecedented. Other administrations — Democrat and Republican — have used them. Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton used a host of measures to reduce the size of the federal workforce.\n\nBut even those who support the idea of paring down the federal government's staffing say a freeze can have some unintended effects.\n\nIf incoming President Donald Trump wants to reduce the size of the federal workforce, what he should really do is decide which programs he wants to cut or eliminate, says Cato Institute tax policy director Chris Edwards.\n\nConsider what the federal workforce consists of: The civilian federal workforce is about 2 million people. That's roughly the same size as it was in the 1960s, when the U.S. population was about half what it is now.\n\nBut Paul Light, a public policy professor at New York University, says adding in federal contractors and grantees brings that number up to between 7 million and 9 million.\n\nLight says Trump's rhetoric about a hiring freeze and promises to drain the swamp seem to address concerns about thinning the ranks of government and making it more effective. But, in fact, hiring freezes tend not to do that, because while dislike of government is popular, he says, nearly all government programs are popular, too, from National Parks to food inspection to Medicare.\n\nWhen you start really looking at what these jobs are, Americans kind of like what most federal employees do, Light says.\n\nIn terms of saving money, it also doesn't work.\n\nA 1982 report — still cited by many experts — found past hiring freezes cost the government more while also resulting in less collection of taxes and other revenue.\n\nFederal payroll and benefits make up less than 10 percent of the federal budget, Light says, and a hiring freeze has a way of encouraging good workers to leave.\n\nSome of your very best employees who can get a job in the private sector will take it, Light says. And to backfill positions that need to be filled, agencies end up hiring more expensive contract workers, instead, which are generally not included in the freeze.\n\nNot everyone agrees.\n\nThis president is going to end up in the middle of some major crisis that's going to depend on how well he makes government work to solve it.\n\nJames Sherk, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, says using contractors is still preferable to hiring workers directly. He says because of unions and appeals processes, it's far too difficult to fire underperforming federal workers.\n\nIt's essentially a lifetime commitment, and if you're not satisfied with the work, there's not much you can do about it, he says of a federal employee. With a contractor, if you're dissatisfied with the work, you just don't renew the contract.\n\nSherk adds that without a hiring freeze, agencies have less incentive to look for fat to cut. You're not looking for the efficiencies, because you don't need to find them.\n\nDonald Kettl, a public policy professor at the University of Maryland, says he believes the freeze is really about a desire among Americans for better-functioning government, and that a better-functioning government requires better hiring.\n\nThe irony here is that if the goal is to make government work better to try to get it more under control, the hiring freeze is exactly the opposite of what you need to do, Kettl says.\n\nKettl says government agencies don't just need to blindly downsize; they need to do a better job of identifying the skills and talent they need, and being more nimble at attracting them.\n\nThe bottom line here is, we have to figure out what it is that we want to do, and what it's going to take to be able to do it well, and hire the people with the skills to make that happen, and we don't have a very good system in the federal government right now for doing that, Kettl says. He says it will be interesting to see how Trump, a businessman, changes government hiring.\n\nKettl warns that just cutting federal agencies could backfire. When they need them, he says, Americans demand robust and functional government service. Think of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he says, or Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nThis president is going to end up in the middle of some major crisis that's going to depend on how well he makes government work to solve it, Kettl says.
Mitt Romney Attacks Trump's Character In 'Washington Post' Op-Ed\n\nRachel Martin talks to GOP strategist Scott Jennings about what GOP Sen.-elect Mitt Romney of Utah had to say about President Trump's character. Romney was the party's 2012 nominee for president.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nThe president shapes the public character of the nation. Trump's character falls short. That is a quote, an excerpt. Actually, the headline of a scathing new Washington Post op-ed by Mitt Romney. The former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential candidate praised President Trump's tax cuts and his hard line on China. But the gist of this op-ed is a moral and ethical takedown of the president of the United States by a new senator from his own party. This comes as Trump meets with congressional leaders today to talk about border security and presumably come up with a plan to end the partial government shutdown.\n\nI'm joined now by Republican strategist Scott Jennings. He was a senior adviser to Mitt Romney in the 2012 campaign. Scott, welcome back to the program.\n\nSCOTT JENNINGS: Good morning. Thank you.\n\nMARTIN: I want to read a little more from this op-ed. Basically, Mitt Romney is saying here that President Trump has, quote, not risen to the mantle of the office. He says the president has failed to lead with honesty or integrity. What is your former boss doing here? I mean, he hasn't even been sworn in yet, and he's attacking the president this way right out of the gate.\n\nJENNINGS: Yeah. I think Senator Romney, Senator-elect Romney is doing what he said he would do during the campaign. I recall back in the summer, he wrote in The Salt Lake Tribune that he was going to speak out when the president does things that he doesn't like. He said he was not going to speak out on every tweet, but that if the president is acting in a way he doesn't approve of, he won't hesitate to speak out. I think he's also doing what a lot of Republicans do, which is separate policy from behavior and style. And that is not something that is unique to Mitt Romney. A lot of Republican voters did that when they voted for Donald Trump in 2016. So Mitt Romney has a six-year term, and he represents a state that won't mind if he tackles the president every now and again. And I expect he'll keep doing that.\n\nMARTIN: Although at one point, Romney appeared to get over his moral qualms with Trump because he was vying to become his secretary of state. So he has changed his mind before.\n\nJENNINGS: He has. I wonder if Mitt Romney is not delivering a little bit of payback to Donald Trump, who sort of led him on for secretary of state and then went with Rex Tillerson, of course, there, during the transition. These two guys have a long and interesting history. I suspect this won't be the last chapter that's written. But these Senate terms being six years, it does give you a lot of political freedom, especially at the beginning, to do things that you don't immediately have to answer for from voters back home.\n\nMARTIN: I want to shift and talk about the shutdown and the border security in that fight. But just briefly, do you think this means Mitt Romney wants to position himself to run against President Trump in 2020?\n\nJENNINGS: No. I can't imagine that to be the case. I mean, I guess if something catastrophic happened to President Trump and he could not run, perhaps Mitt Romney would be a candidate. But my view is Donald Trump is as strong in the Republican Party as he has been during his term, and if he wants to be the nominee of the GOP, he will be that nominee, regardless of Mitt Romney, or John Kasich or anyone else runs against him.\n\nMARTIN: So the president is meeting with lawmakers today at the White House. It's day 12 of this shutdown. Democrats don't have a lot of incentive to back down. Should the president at this point ease up on his demand for the $5 billion for the wall, do you think?\n\nJENNINGS: Well, you're right. They don't have a lot of incentive to back down, and the president hasn't given them much. But he ought to. In my opinion, the president ought to put something back on the table that he put on the table back during their previous negotiations, and that's fixing DACA. Fixing DACA was part of the president's four-pillars strategy way back earlier in 2018. It's something he has endorsed before. That would give pause, I think, to this Democratic strategy of letting this thing run out for a very long time. A lot of these new members of Congress ran on a fix for DACA. I think a very fair deal here would be 5 billion for the wall in exchange for DACA. That's a win for everybody...\n\nMARTIN: Although...\n\nJENNINGS: ...And gets us past this issue.\n\nMARTIN: Sorry to interrupt you, Scott, but even as outgoing chief of staff John Kelly said in an exit interview, the administration gave up on the idea of an actual physical wall a long time ago, that it was always more about border security, technology. Maybe the president hasn't gotten the memo on that, but do you think that's ultimately where it's going to end up, anyway?\n\nJENNINGS: Well, I think that the president says he wants a wall, and John Kelly no longer works there. So (laughter) I don't know, as we message this publicly, what this thing's ultimately going to look like. But I know what the president's going to call it, and that's a wall. And I know the Democrats are going to continue to say they don't want just wall funding. That's why I think there has to be something here, something new, to get past the impasse. That's why I think reintroducing DACA as part of this deal could be that something new that gives everybody a way to go home and say, look what I negotiated for you.\n\nMARTIN: Which, in the end, is what everyone wants, to be able to save face and say they won. Republican strategist Scott Jennings for us this morning.\n\nScott, thanks, as always. We appreciate it.\n\nJENNINGS: Thank you very much.\n\nCopyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Does Subsidizing Crops We're Told To Eat Less Of Fatten Us Up?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images\n\nIf you're a taxpayer, you're in on this system.\n\nWe — the U.S. taxpayers — help subsidize farmers by paying part of the premiums on their crop insurance. This helps ensure that farmers don't go belly up, and it also protects against food shortages.\n\nBut are there unintended consequences? For instance, do subsidies encourage the production — and perhaps overconsumption — of things that we're told to eat less of? Think high fructose corn syrup or perhaps meat produced from livestock raised on subsidized grains.\n\nResearchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Emory University in Atlanta were curious. In a paper published in JAMA Internal Medicine, they point to a disconnect between the nation's agricultural policies and nutritional recommendations.\n\nAmericans are told to fill 50 percent of our plates with fruits and vegetables. But here's the contradiction, as the researchers see it: U.S. agriculture policies focus on financing the production of corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, sorghum, dairy and livestock, the researchers write. About $170 billion was spent between 1995 and 2010 on these seven commodities and programs, according to the researchers.\n\nTo evaluate the association between the consumption of these foods and the health of Americans, the researchers used data collected by a federal health survey to analyze the daily diet of 10,308 adults.\n\nThe survey was based on 24-hour recall, where participants are asked to name everything they ate over the past day. The researchers then estimate the consumption of subsidized food commodities as a percentage of total calories consumed. So what did they find?\n\nHigher consumption of calories from subsidized food commodities was associated with a greater probability of some cardiometabolic risks, the authors conclude. For instance, they found a higher probability of both obesity and unhealthy blood glucose levels (which raises the risk of Type 2 diabetes) among people who consumed the most calories from subsidized foods.\n\nIt makes sense, says one of the study authors, K.M. Venkat Narayan, a professor of global health and epidemiology at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health.\n\nHe says the findings from this study and prior research suggest that subsidies increase production and consumption of products made from these seven foods. And [consumption] of those foods is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors.\n\nNarayan acknowledges the study has shortcomings. For instance, the methodology — known as a cross-sectional study — captures the association at just one point, a snapshot in time. It's possible if people had been interviewed about their diets on a different day — or over a series of years — a different picture would emerge.\n\nIt's also possible that farm subsidies have less influence on what we ultimately choose to eat than this study suggests. (More on that below.) So, this paper doesn't prove a cause and effect. However, this is certainly not the first time that U.S. farm policy has been implicated in the obesity epidemic.\n\nThe idea that our agriculture policies may undermine the health of Americans has been gaining traction. Consider this: The U.S. devotes less than 1 percent of farm subsidies to support the research, production and marketing of fruits and vegetables, according to this editorial penned jointly by former New York Times columnist Mark Bittman, food writer Michael Pollan, and Ricardo Salvador of the Union of Concerned Scientists in 2014.\n\nThe editorial, titled How A National Food Policy Could Save Millions Of American Lives, points out that Michelle Obama [is] warning Americans to avoid high-fructose corn syrup at the same time the president is signing farm bills to subsidize its production.\n\nThe writers suggest the government is funding both sides of the war on Type 2 diabetes, a disease that costs the U.S. $245 billion each year. The government subsidizes soda with one hand, by subsidizing corn farmers, while the other writes checks to pay for insulin pumps to help treat diabetes.\n\nBut, hold on! Are subsidies to farmers really driving our consumption of sodas or other less-than-healthful foods?\n\nNot so fast, argues Raj Patel, a research professor at the University of Texas, Austin who studies global food systems. Commodity subsidies are a small part of a bigger problem, he writes in an editorial published in JAMA Internal Medicine alongside the new study.\n\nLots of factors shape our food choices, from our biological attraction to sugar and other energy-dense foods to the convenience of cheap, packaged goodies. So if we wanted to nudge people to healthier eating habits, what policies might we want to change?\n\nOne way would be to limit demand by restricting the advertising of highly processed food, especially to children, Patel writes. As we've reported, despite pledges by the food industry, most foods and beverages marketed to kids are full of salt, sugar and fat. And food behemoths pay millions of dollars to market junk food and soda — for example, Beyonce's $50 million endorsement of Pepsi.\n\nAnother way to nudge people away from sweetened drinks is to tax them. As we've reported, the city of Philadelphia recently voted in a tax on sweetened beverages, and a similar measure in Mexico prompted a decline in sales of sugary drinks.\n\nThe evidence suggests that the appeal of sugar is so strong that it's tough to pin overconsumption to something as simple as farm policy.\n\nConsider this: Sugar hooked us on yogurt. Americans eschewed yogurt until Dannon began adding sugary jam to the bottom. Same story with cereal. Adding sugar to tasteless flakes drove up sales.\n\nAnd then there's the idea that crop subsidies don't necessarily make food cheaper. Here are two reasons why. First, only a tiny slice — an estimated 15 percent — of the price we pay for processed foods, say, a box of cornflakes or cookies made with wheat and corn syrup, actually goes to the farmer.\n\nIf the price of corn doubles, the price of cornflakes may go up only 10 percent, says Robert Paarlberg, an adjunct professor of public policy specializing in agricultural policy at Harvard's Kennedy School.\n\nThe rest of the retail price is set by packaging, processing, shipping and advertising. Some economists have argued that the cardboard box costs more than the corn inside the box, Paarlberg says. So, 85 percent of what we pay for food has nothing to do with commodity prices.\n\nAnd reason No. 2: Paarlberg argues that U.S. policies actually increase the price of some foods. Take, for example, corn sweeteners. Paarlberg argues that the price of corn syrup is driven up by the fact that the U.S. taxes imports of foreign sugar.\n\nWe place an import levy on cheap sugar from abroad, says Paarlberg. We use it like a quota system to keep cheap sugar from the Caribbean or Australia or South Africa out of our market. And without the global, free market competition, that raises the price inside the U.S. market ... for all sweeteners, including high fructose corn syrup, he says. Also, a significant amount of corn grown in the U.S. is used to make ethanol, so this demand also keeps the price of corn up.\n\nSo, as you can see, the way in which U.S. farm and trade policies influence Americans' eating habits is complicated. And Paarlberg argues that the cost of commodity crops is a trivial factor in the obesity equation.\n\nOthers sound a similar note. Patel argues that many farmers still need the safety net of crop insurance subsidies. He argues that subsidies are vital for indebted farmers who need to pay off creditors.\n\nYanking away the income on which many depend will do little to help promote more healthful eating or more sustainable farming practices, Patel says.\n\nI heard this same response from other farm economists and academics who study agriculture policy. The authors of the new study suggest we should realign government support programs toward more healthful foods. I would agree with that, Harold Van Es, of Cornell University, told me. Although this does not necessarily imply that we should not support [i.e., insure] the traditional commodities.\n\nPart of the challenge of encouraging broader consumption of fruits and vegetables is the expense. The production costs of fresh fruits and vegetables is relatively high, independent of government support programs, Van Es says.\n\nMany experts agree: We need new thinking about how to incentivize more nutritious food choices at the retail level, especially given that the U.S. government spends far more on food assistance programs such as SNAP, aka food stamps, compared with crop subsidies.\n\nPerhaps this is why the government has begun funding programs, such as a subsidy for food stamp recipients to buy fresh food at farmers markets. Meanwhile, some insurers are experimenting with nudging shoppers to make better choices by offering rebates for healthful food.\n\nAnother example? In several U.S. cities, doctors are now prescribing fruits and vegetables — an Rx that can be traded in for free produce at the farmers market. It's part of a program that aims to reshape the buying habits of people at risk of obesity, diabetes and other lifestyle-related diseases.
Las Vegas Welcomes The Spread Of Sports Gambling\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Leila Fadel/NPR Leila Fadel/NPR\n\nAt MGM Grand Las Vegas, a bookmaker takes bets on sports events at the round counter at the Race & Sports Book near the casino. Hockey is among the games being broadcast on 47 flat screens above while gamblers sit in leather seats to watch and strategize.\n\nFor years, Las Vegas has held a fairly exclusive lock on legal sports gambling like this in the U.S. But a Supreme Court decision to strike down an act that effectively banned it in most of the rest of the country now means other states can permit and regulate it, too. And while that means more competition for Las Vegas, casino executives and longtime bookmakers in Nevada are welcoming the decision. They say permitting sports betting is good for everyone in the industry. Besides, they say, people come to Las Vegas for more than that.\n\nOn this day, Kevin Olson and Josh Sturm are on a guys' trip, mostly to play cards and golf. The sports betting is just the icing, they say.\n\nHonestly, there's a lot of avenues online that you can use, and people that we know and myself use online sports betting quite often, Sturm said. So it's really, it's not a lucrative thing that we have to come to Vegas just to be able to do it.\n\nSturm is referring to the millions of people already betting online. The American Gaming Association estimates that people bet $150 billion on professional and college sports illegally every year.\n\nBut Sturm prefers to gamble and make bets in person.\n\nYou know you always wonder 'is there some element of cheating?' I guess, he said.\n\nAnd soon enough, Sturm and his friends might be able to make these bets — legally and in person — closer to their homes in Austin, Texas.\n\nIf something opens up in Texas, Olson says, I feel like I would be doing a bit more sports betting just year-round. Not just here in Vegas.\n\nBut he'll still head to Las Vegas for the experience: golf, cards, slots, shows, restaurants. And that is what bookmakers and casino executives are banking on. They hope that Nevada will be a model for newcomers to the regulated sports betting industry.\n\nYes, we've enjoyed a monopoly or a near monopoly on sports betting, but Las Vegas benefits when there there's interest in our field, in our field of entertainment sports, sports betting, gambling in general, said Jim Murren, the chairman and CEO of MGM Resorts International. It will promote activity, increase fan interest in the team, in the sport, in the league which we believe will in turn increase their interest in going to the sports mecca of sports betting and gambling: Las Vegas.\n\nMurren says people were also worried about Las Vegas when legal gambling went to other states and to Native American reservations.\n\nAnd yet Nevada has grown through that period of time, he said.\n\nMGM hopes to expand sports betting to its other properties in the United States and its online betting app. And with it becoming a legal and regulated industry, Murren said, it's just one more step toward erasing the stigma often attached to the industry as predatory.\n\nThe traditional view of the casino industry is starting to evolve, but it will be viewed much differently five years from now and this will be a major reason why, he said.\n\nCurrently, sports betting is a drop in the bucket of money made in Nevada off gaming. In the last fiscal year, Nevada took in $688.6 million in a tax fee on gambling and just over 2 percent of that came from sports betting according to the Nevada Gaming Association.\n\nThe association welcomed the ruling and offered its expertise to other states that will be regulating sports betting.\n\nBut what does this mean for bookmakers like Jimmy Vaccaro, who has been doing this work for 41 years?\n\nIt's a big day, Vaccaro said at the South Point Hotel and Casino just off the Las Vegas Strip. The in-house satellite radio station praised the decision as enlightened.\n\nNow with it being nationwide, it's going to have an impact, there's no doubt about it, he said. It will be a little less only because if you live in California, you don't have to run over here to make a bet, you could do it right from there.\n\nThere will be fewer people through the doors. But there will be plenty of opportunities a lot of other places for people like us to, in a sense, run their book for them, only because of what we have done, only because the way that we do business, only because of what we do and how we handle it, he says. We will get opportunities. I think the opportunity will outweigh drastically the little part that we lose people coming to the South Point.\n\nAll day, Vaccaro has been in meetings discussing the decision.\n\nThere is a lot to be ironed out to make sports betting lucrative — from state taxes in other places to whether the leagues get a cut of the bets.\n\nBookmaking has changed since Vaccaro started decades ago — betting has moved online and there is a higher cost to air professional football games. But bookmakers adapt, he says.\n\nWe're always reinventing ourselves.
'Middle Class Joe' No More: Biden Earned $15 Million Since Leaving Office\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Joshua Lott/Getty Images Joshua Lott/Getty Images\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden has referred to himself as middle class Joe throughout his political career, and used to regularly joke about being the poorest person on Congress.\n\nThose terms no longer apply.\n\nBiden and his wife, Jill, have together earned more than $15 million since Biden left office. That's according to tax returns and other financial disclosure forms released by Biden's campaign on Tuesday. The bulk of the Bidens' earnings come from book sales and paid speaking engagements – two routine sources of income for former high-ranking public officials.\n\nThe documents show Biden has earned far more than the rest of the 2020 presidential field, with the likely exception of billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race Tuesday.\n\nThe Bidens' adjusted gross income for 2018 was $4.5 million. It was even higher — $11 million – in 2017. They have paid a federal tax rate of just over 33% each year.\n\nBy comparison, Vermont. Sen Bernie Sanders earned $561,293 last year, California Sen. Kamala Harris reported $1,884,319. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren took in $846,394, and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg reported $152,643.\n\nPresidential candidates typically don't release their tax returns until they've become their party's nominee. President Trump broke tradition and refused to make his tax returns public. As Democrats have continued to make that a political issue, the majority of the 2020 field have made their own financial information public. Biden's campaign points out that he's now disclosed the last 21 years of tax returns, including disclosures during his 2008 run and time as vice president.\n\nBiden's itemized financial disclosure shows that his income came mostly from his book Promise Me, Dad about his late son Beau Biden and the book tour that accompanied its release. He also made over $2 million from other paid speaking engagements, an average of over $127,000 per event. Event companies, universities, and community groups were among those who provided for Biden's paid speeches, but not major corporations or industry groups.\n\nThe Bidens gave $275,896 to charity last year. The rate – about six percent of their overall income – was higher than any other candidate except Warren, who also donated about the same percentage of her income.\n\nHere is the latest tax information from Biden and several of the other Democratic candidates who have reported it.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden (2018 return)\n\nAdjusted gross income: $4,580,437\n\nTaxes paid: $1,528,208, or 33% rate\n\nCharity: $275,796, or 6%\n\nSouth Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg (2018 return)\n\nAGI: $152,643\n\nTaxes paid: $20,136, or 13.2%\n\nCharity: $765, or 0.5%\n\nNew York Sen.

Alec Baldwin On Career Highs And Lows And Playing A 'Larger Than Life' Trump\n\nBaldwin is nominated for an Emmy for playing the president on SNL. In 2017, he told Fresh Air that he plays the character in a exaggerated way: It's kind of the Macy's Day Parade [version] of Trump.\n\nDAVID BIANCULLI, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli, editor of the website TV Worth Watching, sitting in for Terry Gross. We've devoted this week to revisiting interviews with some of this year's Emmy nominees. Today's guests are Alec Baldwin, nominated for his guest work playing President Donald Trump on NBC's Saturday Night Live, and Brian Tyree Henry, nominated for two different Emmys, one for comedy, for his role as Paper Boi on the FX series Atlanta and one for drama for a guest appearance on NBC's This Is Us.\n\nWe'll start with Alec Baldwin, who's memorable roles include a ruthless salesman in the film version of Glengarry Glen Ross and the network executive on NBC's 30 Rock. He won an Emmy for his portrayal on Saturday Night Live of Donald Trump last year and is nominated again for it this year.\n\nTerry Gross spoke to him in April 2017 when he published his memoir called Nevertheless. They began by playing a Saturday Night Live clip from 2017. Aliens have attacked the Earth. Kenan Thompson plays a military officer giving the troops a pep talk about how to save the human race. But first, he says, your commander in chief wants to say a few words. And he steps aside for President Trump, played by Alec Baldwin.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE)\n\nALEC BALDWIN: (As Donald Trump) Now, here's the deal. We are going to beat these aliens because we have got the best military. But we don't win anymore.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBALDWIN: (As Donald Trump) And the aliens are laughing at us. They're killing us, and they're laughing at us.\n\nKENAN THOMPSON: (As Military Officer) We know the aliens are killing us, sir. They have the most advanced weaponized technology we've ever seen. What should we do?\n\nBALDWIN: (As Donald Trump) OK, here's what we do. Here's what we're going to do. We are going to bring coal back, OK?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBALDWIN: (Donald Trump) We're going to have so much coal, you're going to say, where did all this coal come from? I never knew there could be so much coal.\n\nTHOMPSON: (As Military Officer) But, Mr. President, what about the aliens? They just vaporized the entire state of California.\n\nBALDWIN: (As Donald Trump) So then I won the popular vote?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nTHOMPSON: (As Military Officer) Sir, please, everyone in California is dead.\n\nBALDWIN: (As Donald Trump) Even Arnold?\n\nTHOMPSON: (As Military Officer) Sir, yes. We are dealing with a highly advanced species here. They're from Zorblat-9. Their ships are invisible. They're telepathic.\n\nBALDWIN: (Donald Trump) OK, now, we don't know that they are from Zorblat-9. I've actually heard Zorblat-9 is very beautiful, very fantastic.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Oh, my God, does he have business ties on Zorblat-9?\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nTERRY GROSS, BYLINE: Alec Baldwin, welcome back to FRESH AIR. How did you start doing Donald Trump? And what stood out for you watching him that you thought you could do to caricature him?\n\nBALDWIN: Well, I think other people can certainly do Trump more deftly than I can. I don't think I really do the greatest impersonation of Trump, per se. But we're not doing it on film. We're doing it live on a TV show at 11:30 at night in front of a live audience. So there's a kind of - you kind of blow it up. You know, it's kind of the Macy's Day Parade...\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: ...Of Trump. You know, it's a very larger-than-life thing. And I think in the back of my mind, maybe I could do him a little more precisely if we were in a different venue. But for this, you've got to pick a couple things, which is just his - I mean, I always say the same stupid thing to myself. I say, you know, left eyebrow up, right eyebrow down, stick your mouth out as far as you can like you're trying to bite somebody's nose off and kind of growl with that irritability.\n\nYou know, Trump is someone, to me, where the things I try to lock into and kind of hold onto just for that brief five minutes of the cold opening is that he's not having any fun. He doesn't shut up about how rich he is. He doesn't stop talking about how much money he has and how much privilege he has. And he just seems miserable. I mean, if he's an advertisement for wealth and privilege, then, good God, I think it's terrible.\n\nBut anyway, so we did that. And he was always straining to find a stronger, better word in his language and never found it. So you'd have him pause. You know, Trump is always in there going, you know, (imitating Donald Trump) the people that I work with, they're just really, really the most fantastic people. They're fantastic.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: You know, he just always - you see him digging in some bin. He's, like, in a filing room looking for another word. And he'll say, (imitating Donald Trump) my son-in-law Jared is really just an amazing young guy. He's amazing. He's just amazing. I think he has, like, a glossary of about, like, 200 words.\n\nGROSS: So Trump has negative tweeted about Saturday Night Live and about you in particular. I'll read a couple of tweets. This is October 16 at 7:14 a.m. (Reading) Watched Saturday Night Live...\n\nBALDWIN: (Laughter).\n\nGROSS: ...Hit job on me. Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks. Media rigging election. December 4, 12:13 a.m. (Reading) Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable, totally biased, not funny. And the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad. And you responded (reading) release your tax returns and I'll stop (laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: Yes. Yes.\n\nGROSS: He hasn't released them. You haven't stopped.\n\nBALDWIN: No, I'm still waiting.\n\nGROSS: What was your first reaction when you realized that Trump was tweeting about your impersonation?\n\nBALDWIN: It is kind of absurd. Well, I mean, regardless of whether you're the subject of those tweets or one of them - 'cause all those tweets are kind of a multiple warhead, you know. He takes on the show, he takes on the press, he takes on me. But I think it's absurd that he would be doing that in the direction of anybody - any kind of comedy programming that's parodying him or commenting on him, whether it was Jon Stewart in his day and so forth or Colbert now. I find it amazing that he's doing that. And then when you think about it's me that he's doing it with, I find that even more surreal.\n\nGROSS: So let's talk a little bit about your memoir Nevertheless. One of the things I really enjoyed learning about you is that growing up in Long Island - Massapequa, Long Island, you watched a lot of old movies on TV. I grew up in New York City in Brooklyn and watched a lot of the same movie shows that you did - The Late Show, The Late Late Show, The Early Show. What was the Sunday afternoon thing you mentioned?\n\nBALDWIN: Picture For A Sunday Afternoon.\n\nGROSS: Yeah, Picture For A Sunday Afternoon. And then you explain in your book that you bonded with your father watching, like, the late-night old movies on TV and you bonded with your mother when you faked being sick and stayed home from school and watched daytime TV with her.\n\nBALDWIN: Dinah Shore.\n\nGROSS: Yeah, so I just thought that's so interesting that you became an actor and, like, TV, you know, like, movies and TV were ways of bonding with your parents. But - so with the movies that you saw on TV, what are the movies that you saw the most that made the biggest impression, ones that you were able to watch over and over?\n\nBALDWIN: I guess, you know, when I was young, my dad - I'm perfectly willing to see now that what I loved and what I was doing and what I was opening up my mind to was to communicate with my dad. He would come home from work. He'd lay on this day bed in the den of our house. There was a TV. And I'd sit in a chair and, you know, this was his sacred time, his alone time. No one could get near him or really, really bother him in the evening 'cause, you know, he'd get home sometimes, you know, 10, 11 o'clock. And sometimes I think he stayed away. Maybe he pretended he had a job at night, and he was really just doing something else.\n\nBut he was - it was tough. You know, he would come home and six kids and my mom - and I think everybody was just stressed out. And he'd be reading the capsule reviews in The Times' TV section. And my dad would say, wow, How Green Was My Valley. That's a good one. At 11:30, I'd say, can we watch How Green Was My Valley, Dad? I was 10 years old. He'd say, no, no, no. It's too late. He goes, well, let's just watch 10 minutes - 10 minutes, 15 minutes of How Green Was My Valley and you have to go to bed. I'd be like, sure, Dad, sure. It would work like a charm. TV comes on, How Green Was My Valley, my dad passes out on the couch. He falls asleep, and I watch all of How Green Was My Valley. I watched the whole thing. Some nights I actually got away with watching a piece of the next one that was on at, like, 1:15 in the morning.\n\nGROSS: In your memoir, you write that you learned lines from a lot of different films. So I'm going to ask you to do a passage from a film that you still remember.\n\nBALDWIN: (Laughter) Oh, God.\n\nGROSS: Yes? Yeah.\n\nBALDWIN: Well, I'll always remember, like, just lines that I used to think were funny. You know, like, those men - I loved men in movies who they always won. And they won in some funny way. Like, there's that time that Bogart has got - Elisha Cook Jr. has gotten him in the hotel. And he's walking him up to go meet Sydney Greenstreet in Maltese Falcon. And he's got the gun on him. And Bogart disarms Elisha Cook Jr. And he gets the gun away from him and he points the gun at him and says, come on. And he says, that will get you in real good with your boss.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: And I just love things like that, where the guy - the hero wins. And they really were great bad guys. I mean, they were - they made the bad guys really bad, you know, really bad. And, you know, Treasure Of The Sierra Madre - what's three times $35,000? I bet you $105,000 you fall asleep before I do, he'd say to those guys. So all those movies - you know, Bogart was, like, the great one. He was such a great actor and so different and so unique. But Cagney, Bogart, Paul Muni, Edward G. Robinson...\n\nGROSS: Wait, wait, wait - I'm going to stop you. Everybody used to do impressions of Cagney. All the comics used to do impressions of Cagney when I was growing up.\n\nBALDWIN: Yeah, yeah - when I was a kid, yeah.\n\nGROSS: Did you have a Cagney impression?\n\nBALDWIN: Cagney was - well, I mean, I always get the line wrong because I went back and saw the movie Public Enemy. I think he's got the guy in the trunk of the car where the guy goes - (imitating character) open up, open up. I can't breathe in here. I can't breathe. I don't have any air.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: And Cagney stands outside - Cagney goes, (imitating James Cagney) Air? You want air? I'll give you air - boom, boom, boom. And he shoots him through the trunk of the car.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBALDWIN: And I thought, God, what a horrible thing to say. (Imitating James Cagney) You want air? I'll give you air. And we used to do that. I'd lay in bed next to my mother. My mother was trying to sleep. She would take naps every day. This was when I was like 10, and my mother had six little kids. You realize - I look now at my children, my young children, and I realized my mother had little children. So they need to be constantly watched.\n\nWhen the kids - when my brothers and I got to be, all of us, got to be 16, 15, 14, my mother just opened the door and kicked us out of the house. She said, I don't care what you do. Just make sure you don't get hit by a car but get out. And she banished us from the house in the driving snow. She evicted us from the house. She just didn't want us in the house so she wouldn't lose her marbles. And - but when I was a little boy and I lay in bed next to my mother, my mother would be sleeping. And in this very quiet voice, you'd hear me go, (imitating James Cagney) Air? You want air? I'll give you air. Boom, boom, boom. My mother would hit me and say...\n\nGROSS: You all...\n\nBALDWIN: ...Lie still.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) You also used to watch Chiller Theater when you were growing up, which was the Saturday night late-night monster movie...\n\nBALDWIN: Chiller, yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...That Zacherley hosted. And my older brother would watch that, and I was allowed to stay up for a few minutes of it. And it terrified me. I fell in love with monster movies, you know, 'cause the things that really scare you...\n\nBALDWIN: Sure.\n\nGROSS: ...Then you fall in love with afterwards. So...\n\nBALDWIN: Lugosi, all those movies. Well, Lugosi...\n\nGROSS: Yeah, what really scared you when you were young? Yeah.\n\nBALDWIN: Oh, Dracula. I'd watch Dracula 50 times. (Imitating Bela Lugosi) Listen to them, children of the night. What music they make, he'd say.\n\nGROSS: I love that (laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: And then - love that one, and I love - my favorite line - Matthew Broderick and I always regale each other with our Claude Rains line readings from Invisible Man because we're Invisible Man junkies. And whenever Matthew and I see each other, we look at each other and say, (imitating Claude Rains) sit down, you fool, and let's have a decent fire...\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: ...Because he says that to his enemy in the film. And the very first movie that I watched with my dad that I was - that made me an addict - was we would watch Million Dollar Movie. And Sorry, Wrong Number came on with Barbara Stanwyck and Burt Lancaster. And that movie scared the hell out of me. The idea that a man would pay people to kill his wife to collect the insurance - and I was probably 8 or 9 years old. And I was a complete idiot. I'd look at my dad and say, gee, Dad - I was like Dondi out of Dondi comics. I was like, gee, Dad, do people really do that, Dad? - pay people to kill their wives to get the insurance, Dad? My father would, like, glare over at my mother and go indeed they do, yes, indeed they do.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nBIANCULLI: Alec Baldwin speaking to Terry Gross in 2017. He's nominated for an Emmy for his impersonation of President Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live for the second year in a row. He won last year. More after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF AWREEOH SONG, CAN'T BRING ME DOWN)\n\nBIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to Terry's interview with actor Alec Baldwin. He's nominated this year for a guest actor Emmy Award for his portrayal of President Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live. Terry spoke to him in 2017 when his memoir called Nevertheless was published.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nGROSS: So you grew up in Massapequa, Long Island, and - you point out - not the affluent part. There were two high schools. Your father taught at the one where the more prosperous families sent their kids, and you went to the other one. Your father taught history and economics. He coached football and riflery. He chaperoned dances, supervised weekend recreation programs, directed one of the school district's summer camp programs. And you say he was strict with you because he'd seen what happens to kids who go off the track and who start drinking or using drugs. So in what way was he strict with you?\n\nBALDWIN: Well, my dad grew up in Brooklyn. And I think my dad just, you know, he saw a tough part of Brooklyn. He played football at Boys High. He went to Syracuse and played football, and he was around some pretty tough people. And they moved to a tough - to Fort Greene when Fort Greene was not a good area like it is now. It's all been built up. And I think when he moved out to Long Island, like a lot of city dads, it was almost like we didn't move out here for you to get it wrong, you know?\n\nAnd he didn't realize - well, I take that back. He did realize, but I think he was puzzled with how to deal with the fact that people that moved out from the city brought all of the problems of the city with them as well - 'cause kids that are unoccupied, they're going to do drugs and drink and party and things like that. So my dad was very, very - I'm not going to say menacing, but he was very, very forceful with us.\n\nHe would, like, look at me and say - where are you going to go? I'd say, I'm going to go to my friend Jeff's house. He goes, what are you guys going to do? Did you leave the phone number with your mother? And everything was very calm and very officious. And then at the end he'd say, what time are you going to come home? I'd say, I'm going to be home at 10:30. And I'm tense the whole time. I mean, like, I'm waiting for the bomb to drop. He'd lean in and press his finger into my shoulder. And he'd say, if you're not back at this house at 10:30, I'm going to break every bone in your body. Do you understand me? And I was like, yes, yes. Oh, God. Oh, God. Yes.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: I was just terrified. I mean, that's what - other people who we grew up with, those dads had other things to withhold from their kids to control them. You can't use the boat this weekend. I'm going to take your car away. I'm going to take your allowance away. We had none of that. My father had nothing to give to us, you know, in addition to what was normal - our clothes and food and housing and if we needed money for certain - specific expenses related to our school and trips. But he wasn't handing out allowances ever. That was just - it didn't happen. We had to go out and earn our own money. And so the only thing he had was the fear program.\n\nGROSS: Did he ever use the threats? Did he ever...\n\nBALDWIN: I mean, there were times my dad would, like, you know, grab you by the shirt and, like, slam you up against the wall when you were, like, 15. That was a different generation. I mean, my dad wasn't somebody who was beating us with a pool cue. But he was someone who would - and every time he'd lose his temper and he'd grab you - and he was a pretty tough guy. My father was a very physically powerful, very tough guy when he was, especially when he was younger. He deteriorated very quickly in his 50s and died when he was 55 years old of cancer. But he never really got a chance to see me do what I do.\n\nI was doing this daytime TV show, which was fun. And it was important 'cause it was the beginning for me. But I just think about what I would have done to - you know, to show my dad how much I loved him and cared about him, too. You know, he - my dad was somebody who if - you know, I would have sent him around the world 10 times to enjoy himself to pay him back for what he did for me.\n\nGROSS: How did you decide to pursue acting in the first place? You were interested in politics. You ran for the president of George Washington University when you were a student there. You lost. And then it seems like a big switch from politics and history to acting.\n\nBALDWIN: Well, I think that, you know, the year ahead of me was kind of a gut year, as they used to say. I don't know if they use that term now. But I had done all my hard classes in my sophomore and junior year and got involved in student politics 'cause it interested me to a degree. And I wanted to go into politics and run for office and get a law degree to help supplement that or help to facilitate that. So I - my girlfriend broke up with me. I was in love with this woman when I was very young, and she said, I can't be with you 'cause you're not Jewish. Her grandparents told her to break up with me, and she did. Her grandparents said lose the shegetz boyfriend.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: And she did. And I go to visit a friend of mine. She says, why don't you audition for the acting program? I auditioned for the program. And I think, because I was...\n\nGROSS: Why did they say audition for the acting - like, what evidence was there that you had any...\n\nBALDWIN: I would hang out with them, and they'd say, oh, you're so funny. And, you're so cheery.\n\nGROSS: Oh, OK.\n\nBALDWIN: And you're such an animated person.\n\nGROSS: Were you doing impressions for them, too, of your favorite movie lines?\n\nBALDWIN: I would do - yeah. Air? You want air?\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) Right.\n\nBALDWIN: I'll give you air.\n\nGROSS: Right.\n\nBALDWIN: Whatever you were doing, your shtick. And then the next thing you know, a friend of mine, who was at NYU, her roommate was in the acting program. I went to visit my friend, and her roommate said, my God, you should audition for the program just for the hell of it. And I did. And I got in, and they gave me a need-based scholarship for the whole year there. And the joke in my family is that I called my parents, and my mother was apoplectic. I mean, she was screaming on the phone. What is wrong with you? And I said, I'm going to leave GW to go to NYU to study acting. And I said, now, Mom and Dad - I said, when I go back to New York as a returning New Yorker, I'm eligible for all of this financial aid that I lost when I left town. So when I went to D.C. - so actually, NYU was more expensive than GW, but it's going to cost you less money. And my father literally went, well, let's hear him out. Let's hear him out.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: And I moved there, and I said to myself, I'll do this for a year - one year only. I'll study. And if I get any kind of encouragement that I might have a career in this, I'll do it. And if I don't, I'm out. I'll go back to - I'll finish my poly-sci program and go to law school, and that's that. And I did the program for a year and got out. And I got a job right away, and I never stopped working since then.\n\nGROSS: Just one more question. I haven't heard you as the announcer of the New York Philharmonic radio broadcasts. I know you fell in love with classical music being stuck in traffic jams in LA and listening to the radio. Do you do, like, an announcer voice, the kind of voice you grew up with?\n\nBALDWIN: Yes. The guy that was the booth announcer, Robert Malley (ph), who was on the WOR booth announcer - they'd have the guy live in the booth in case there was a technical difficulty in the pre-digital age. And Malley would say, next on Million Dollar Movie, Barbara Stanwyck tells Gary Cooper where he can go on Ball Of Fire. And I used to sit there and go, my God. And when I did the Philharmonic, they'd say to me, you've got to articulate because you're going to be saying names. It took me 40 minutes to learn how to say Christoph von Dohnanyi.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: I was reading it going what the - Christoph. I'd say the Berlioz Symphonie fantastique Christoph von Dohnanyi conducts the New York Philharmonic. And I always pop the word New York 'cause I'm marketing. I'm selling. So I always go, this is the Mahler Ninth Symphony. Lorin Maazel conducts the New York Philharmonic 'cause I'm helping to sell the product.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nBALDWIN: I'm a pitch man. I'm a pitch man. Anyway, thank you so much.\n\nGROSS: Alec Baldwin, thank you so much.\n\nBALDWIN: I love your show. Thank you for having me.\n\nGROSS: I'm so - thank you for doing it.\n\nBIANCULLI: Alec Baldwin speaking to Terry Gross in 2017. He's nominated this year for a guest actor Emmy Award for his portrayal of President Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live. After a break, we'll hear from another of this year's Emmy nominees, Brian Tyree Henry nominated for two Emmys.

Who's Trading Bitcoin? South Korea Wants To Know\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ahn Young-joon/AP Ahn Young-joon/AP\n\nSouth Korea is requiring that anonymous transactions involving cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin be made traceable and that exchanges for digital currencies be subject to a 24.2 percent tax.\n\nSouth Korea is home to one of the world's largest bitcoin exchanges and is the third-largest market for it, behind Japan and the U.S.\n\nAlthough policy directives announced this week were telegraphed last month, they come at a time when bitcoin has been trending about 50 percent lower than its peak of nearly $20,000 in mid-December. Other cryptocurrencies, such as Ether, have also fallen sharply in the past week.\n\nSouth Korea's Financial Services Commission Vice Chair Kim Yong-beom said Tuesday that the new measures would take effect beginning Jan. 30.\n\nHe said it would keep foreigners without a South Korean bank account and minors younger than 19 from trading bitcoins and other digital currencies. Accounts that have been used until now to trade such currencies will be discontinued, Kim said.\n\nWe expect that cryptocurrency exchanges that are in danger of being exploited for money laundering will be thrown out of the market, Kim told reporters.\n\nReuters reports: The new requirements are meant to ensure that a cryptocurrency investor's money comes from a bank account owned by the same individual. Banks will be able to refuse to open accounts with cryptocurrency exchanges that do not disclose information about suspicious trading. They were told to closely monitor crypto trading that exceeds 10 million won ($9,338) a day or 20 million won ($18,676) per week and also accounts owned by corporations or groups and report any suspicious activity to the authorities.\n\nThe new tax is in line with what the government currently charges all corporations that earn more than 20 billion won ($18.7 million) per year.\n\nCointelegraph.com writes: Bithumb, which is the largest exchange globally at $2.85 [billion] daily trading volume as of press time, was hacked in February 2017, losing about $7 [million] in mostly Bitcoin and Ether. This security breach, along with several other breaches of South Korean exchanges, has recently been more definitively linked to North Korean hackers.\n\nEarlier this month, South Korea said it was considering a complete ban on trading bitcoins.
Ethics Agency Rejects White House Move To Block Ethics Waiver Disclosures\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nUpdated at 10:08 p.m. ET.\n\nThe Office of Government Ethics has rejected a White House attempt to block the agency's compilation of federal ethics rules waivers granted to officials hired into the Trump administration from corporations and lobbying firms.\n\nThe White House action, a letter to OGE Director Walter M. Shaub Jr. from Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, was first reported by The New York Times. The newspaper had earlier published a detailed account of lobbyists turned appointees who were granted waivers and now oversee regulations they previously had lobbied against.\n\nWith an ethics waiver, a federal official is free to act on matters that normally would trigger concerns about conflicts of interest or other ethical problems. Federal regulations say the waivers generally should be made public on request. The Obama administration routinely posted waivers online. The Trump administration has issued an unknown number and released none.\n\nShaub notified the White House and federal agencies in April that OGE wanted to see all ethics waivers issued by President Trump's administration. He set June 1 as the deadline. The broad request is known as a data call.\n\nMulvaney notified Shaub in a letter last week that the data call appears to raise legal questions regarding the scope of OGE's authorities. He said he wanted the data call put on hold until it is reviewed by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which advises the executive branch on constitutional questions and limits of executive power. The move could block the request for waivers indefinitely.\n\nShaub told the White House late Monday that his agency would continue collecting the ethics waivers. In a nine-page response, Shaub said that the OGE declines your request to suspend its ethics authority, adding that public confidence in the integrity of government decisionmaking demands no less.\n\nUnder federal regulations, OGE is supposed to oversee all waiver decisions throughout the government.\n\nOGE has a right to review any waiver, said former OGE Assistant Director Stuart Gilman. Referring to the data call, he said, It's not like somehow or other this is a special case.\n\nThe ethics waivers are supposed to be public documents, but the administration so far has not released them. An anti-Trump legal group, American Oversight, sued eight federal departments and agencies on Monday, arguing that ethics waivers should be released under the Freedom of Information Act. American Oversight had previously filed FOIA requests.\n\nThe Trump administration and OGE are fighting on other fronts, as well:\n\n-- OGE earlier this month announced a new certification document for Cabinet secretaries and other top-ranking appointees to show they are fulfilling the ethics agreements they signed before being confirmed by the Senate. Ethics agreements typically commit a nominee to avoid ethics violations through a blind trust, divestiture, recusal or similar action.\n\nThe document must be signed by the official. As with tax returns and other federal documents, false statements run the risk of penalties. There was no previous oversight of compliance.\n\n-- The White House has raised a conflict-of-interest question to challenge newly appointed special counsel Robert Mueller, who will oversee the FBI's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThe issue is that other lawyers at Mueller's former law firm represent presidential daughter Ivanka Trump; her husband, Jared Kushner; and onetime Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. Mueller never worked for those clients, but under ethics law he still could require a waiver for his new job. It's worth noting that while the White House suggests conflicts for Mueller, it obtained an ethics agreement for EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. He needed it because, in his previous job as Oklahoma attorney general, he was a plaintiff in several lawsuits challenging EPA regulations.\n\n-- Last winter, Shaub used Twitter to exhort Trump into putting his hundreds of corporations into a blind trust. Trump instead put them into a revocable trust, where he can draw money from his businesses whenever he wants.
Youth Activists Are Heard In Biden's White House, But They Want To See More Action\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Zach Gibson/Getty Images Zach Gibson/Getty Images\n\nThe day before President Biden's allies on Capitol Hill were set to roll out his sweeping immigration overhaul, a group of activists rallied outside of the headquarters of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, projecting a message onto the building's façade.\n\nICE is deporting and torturing people, the all-caps message read. Abolish ICE and CBP, a reference to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe protesters were organized by United We Dream, the immigrant youth organization. United We Dream is one of a number of youth-led groups in regular contact with the Biden administration on key policy issues. While these activists are encouraged by what some described as open lines of communication to the White House, they say they're waiting to see whether that translates into policy victories.\n\nWhat we know and what I learned as an organizer is that access does not equal power,  said Greisa Martinez, the executive director of United We Dream. So we continue to organize.\n\nAfter a Democratic primary that was rife with generational tensions, Biden has so far managed to hold together the Democratic coalition that elected him, including the young people who turned out for Biden in droves. Now, younger Americans are confronting the intersecting crises of the coronavirus pandemic, an economic crisis, a national reckoning on race and justice and the urgent climate crisis.\n\nDemocrats control the levers of power in Washington with Joe Biden as the party leader, said Jesse Barba, a spokesman for Young Invincibles. And with it, they are having to own the outcome of how young people will weather the economic and health storms of the last four years.\n\nDuring the campaign, candidate Biden pulled out all the stops to make sure that young people knew the issues that mattered to them were deeply felt, in an effort to ensure that they would show up at the ballot box. Now, the Biden White House is acutely focused on making sure that those same young people feel heard.\n\nLeaders of youth-led movements have been invited to participate in regular meetings with administration officials, including Cedric Richmond, a Biden senior adviser and director of the White House Office of Public Engagement.\n\nI think there's a listening ear that's coming from the administration and Democrats on the Hill, for that matter, said Ben Wessel, the executive director of NextGen America, a progressive group dedicated to mobilizing young people. I think time will tell whether that listening ear becomes an action oriented or a legislative strategy.\n\nRichmond and Susan Rice, the head of the Domestic Policy Council, held a virtual meeting last week with more than a dozen youth activists focused on community violence prevention. The White House released an official readout of the meeting, saying that Rice and Richmond underscored President Biden's commitment to taking action to make our communities safer and to ensure that equity drives our policymaking across the federal government.\n\nOne of the activists involved in that discussion was Max Markham, the policy director for March For Our Lives, the group was founded by survivors of the deadly 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida. He says he and his colleagues have been heartened by some of the conversations with the administration.\n\nWe have been vocal in our expectations that the Biden Administration has to have a plan and has to address gun violence as a public health emergency and that starts with staffing, that starts with who they're hiring and who they're empowering and the voices that they're amplifying, Markham said in an interview.\n\nWhile some activists say they appreciate having open lines of communication with the administration, including at its highest levels, they do not plan to stop asserting public pressure on the administration from the outside.\n\nMarch For Our Lives this week called on Biden to release a plan to curb gun violence in the first 100 days of his administration, that includes appointing a senior staffer as director of gun violence prevention to focus on the issue. March For Our Lives is also calling on Biden to leverage the Stafford Act, the federal disaster relief statute, to unlock $1 billion in funding to be used for community intervention programming and data collection with a public health lens.\n\nWe got the president into office and we expect results, Markham said. And we will make our voices known if that is not the case.\n\nThe early days of the Biden administration have been focused on meeting the immediate needs of the nation as it grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, including a $1.9 trillion emergency relief plan currently before Congress.\n\nMany young activists pointed to that package as a meaningful example of why it's so important that they be involved in policy conversations. The package now includes adult dependents among those eligible for stimulus payments.\n\nIn the two previous rounds of stimulus payments, adults who could be claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return were not eligible for money, a move that excluded more than 13.5 million adult dependents, according to the People's Policy Project.\n\nPeople think that adult dependents aren't having to pay their rent, aren't contributing to their own household income and well-being, said Sarah Audelo, the executive director of the Alliance for Youth Action. So there are some pieces that are very distinct to, 'Wow, this is an experience that someone who's 20 years old will only have.' So we need people who have that experience to be able to bring that perspective forward.\n\nPolicy tensions lie ahead\n\nMany organizers also say they're keenly aware that the administration is currently having its honeymoon period.\n\nAt some point, we're gonna run out of easy things to do, said Wessel. The to do list is going to get more challenging — things that are going to take a little more political courage and bravery, or a little more muscle in persuading the rest of America, not just young progressives.\n\nOne early point of tension came when Biden, speaking at a CNN town hall, outwardly rejected calls to eliminate up to $50,000 of student loan debt, a priority of many young organizers and liberal Democrats.\n\nI think there's just a lot of education clearly that needs to be done about who holds student debt, about the impact of student debt, said Audelo. I was hoping we were in a more positive place but then the town hall response was like, 'OK cool, we're like 15 years behind.'\n\nAnother potential point of conflict is the issue of immigration, with Democrats in need of at least 10 Republican votes in the Senate to pass Biden's sweeping immigration bill.\n\nThe proposal offers a path to citizenship for most of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. There have been steep political challenges to moving immigration legislation through Congress, and Republicans have already signaled resistance to Biden's legislation.\n\nGreisa Martinez of United We Dream said that part of the work that her organization and others are doing is engaging on policy with administration officials, but also being clear about what's at stake for folks outside of the administration.\n\nStill, Martinez is undeterred.\n\nIt's not just undocumented people that are clamoring for a different direction on immigration. It's millions of people that went out to vote and people are super clear that deportations and enforcement and detention is not the pathway that the majority of American voters want to go, and that's why they chose Joe Biden, Martinez said. What we know for sure is that we can't leave 2021 without any protection for people.\n\nSeeking more seats at the table\n\nThe demands of young organizers are sweeping in terms of policy, but they are also calling on the administration to bring more young people into the administration in meaningful ways.\n\nMany groups are calling on Biden to establish an Office of Young Americans within the White House and to appoint a director of youth engagement who will sit on the Domestic Policy Council.\n\nBiden does owe a lot to young people. But it's not just repaying us for helping him to get elected, it's making sure that he actually is working with us, said Charlotte Kerpen, the chair of the High School Democrats of America. For Biden to have a group of young people that he can really consult to, would make sure that the policies are not only reflecting the beliefs of young people, but are helping to make sure that in the future, the policies are representing what we have always believed. \n\nEarlier this month, the White House announced that Vincent Toranzo, a high school senior from Pembroke Pines, Fla., would serve on the administration's COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force, aimed at addressing COVID-19 related health and social inequities.\n\nActivists pointed to other staffers with backgrounds in youth-led movements like Maggie Thomas, now the chief of staff in the Office of Domestic Climate Policy. She previously worked on the presidential campaigns of Democrats Jay Inslee and Elizabeth Warren, before helping to launch the climate group Evergreen.\n\nIn the past we've seen too often where there will be a public engagement arm and it's just separate from the actual policy work that's happening in an administration, said Audelo. And that's just unacceptable and that is not what young people are trying to do. They want to make sure that their concerns, that the unique perspective that young people have into the fight on climate, into the fights on the economy... that those perspectives, their ideas are reflected in actual policy discussions.
Trump Foundation's Tax Returns Reportedly Acknowledge Violating IRS Rule\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Carolyn Kaster/AP Carolyn Kaster/AP\n\nThe Donald J. Trump Foundation has acknowledged in a tax filing that it violated the ban against self-dealing, or using its assets to help its leader's business or personal interests, The Washington Post reported.\n\nThe Post quoted copies of the foundation's 2015 IRS tax returns, which had been uploaded, apparently by the foundation's attorneys, to a nonprofit tracking site called GuideStar. The newspaper said it hadn't yet confirmed whether the forms had actually been sent to the IRS.\n\nThe returns asked whether the foundation has transferred income or assets to a disqualified person or had engaged in any acts of self-dealing in past years. In both cases, the foundation checked the box for Yes.\n\nThere was no indication what the returns were referring to, or what kind of self-dealing might have taken place.\n\nTrump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nUnder IRS regulations, an admission of self-dealing by the leader of a nonprofit foundation can lead to a fine.\n\nThe Trump foundation has been accused of using its assets to pay debts incurred by Trump and his businesses over the past decade. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is investigating the foundation.\n\nIn one case, the Post said Trump settled a dispute with Florida's Palm Beach County over the size of a flagpole at his Mar-a-Lago club by agreeing to make a donation to a veterans' charity. Trump made the donation using funds from the foundation, the newspaper reported.\n\nIn another case, Trump is said to have used funds from the foundation to settle a dispute with a man who made a hole-in-one at Trump's golf course in Westchester County, N.Y.\n\nTrump also reportedly used foundation funds to pay for items that he and his wife, Melania, bought at charity auctions, including a 6-foot-tall painting of Trump himself.
Trump, Pelosi Agree On Coronavirus Relief Bill. Next Hurdle: The Senate\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nUpdated at 12:54 a.m. ET\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the White House agreed Friday on relief legislation in response to the national emergency over the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe House passed the measure by an overwhelming vote Friday night.\n\nThe breakthrough followed hours of negotiations between the speaker and the administration, including more than a dozen phone calls on Friday between Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about the priorities for the package.\n\nPresident Trump was reticent about the deal until the last moment, but he intends to sign the legislation when it reaches him, according to a source familiar with the White House's plans.\n\nThe president also wrote on Twitter on Friday evening that he encouraged Republicans and Democrats to join together in supporting the bill.\n\nPelosi told Democratic colleagues in a letter earlier on Friday evening that the agreement she'd struck with the administration responded to what she called her top priority: testing, testing testing.\n\nTo stop the spread of the virus, we have secured free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured, the speaker wrote. We cannot fight coronavirus effectively unless everyone in our country who needs to be tested can get their test free of charge.\n\nPelosi also told Democrats that the legislation would approve paid emergency leave; enhanced unemployment insurance; more food aid; and increased federal funds for health care.\n\nShe and House Democratic leaders had hoped to fast-track legislation they unveiled earlier this week but so far discussions with Republicans about possible changes hadn't gone smoothly enough to permit that.\n\nNational emergency\n\nTrump declared a national emergency related to the pandemic in a press conference on Friday afternoon at the White House.\n\nThe president said then in response to a reporter's question that he thought Democrats needed to yield more ground in their negotiations over the relief legislation, although he didn't go into detail.\n\nWe just don't think they're giving enough, Trump said. We could have something but we don't think they're giving enough. They're not doing what's right for the country.\n\nSeparately, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., sent a letter to House Democrats Friday afternoon noting that the speaker has literally been working around the clock on a deal.\n\nBut he said if one was not reached we will vote today on our bill, which incorporates nearly all of what the administration and Republicans have requested.\n\nOpposition to bloat\n\nSeveral Hill Republicans said they were worried that the latest version of the bill was bloated and were unwilling to make a final call on their support until the text is released.\n\nThere also were concerns among some GOP lawmakers that President Trump has not explicitly embraced the legislation, potentially leaving Republicans open to attacks if they voted for something Trump did not support.\n\nThe particulars in dispute included the economic aspects of any relief bill, including the prospect for emergency payroll tax cuts. President Trump wanted them; Democrats and a few Republicans didn't agree.\n\nThe president also faulted Pelosi and Democrats on Thursday for wanting goodies in coronavirus legislation that he said had nothing to do with what we're talking about. Those details weren't exactly clear.\n\nAlso unclear on Friday is the legislation's fate in the Senate.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., cancelled a recess planned for next week meaning that members would be in Washington to be able to vote — but it wasn't immediately clear how he and members might respond to the deal concluded between Pelosi and Mnuchin.\n\nMcConnell reacted coolly to the draft of the coronavirus bill as it stood earlier in the week.
Marijuana Pays For Schools In Colorado — Kind Of — But How Will It Help Maine?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy Luke Runyon, KUNC Courtesy Luke Runyon, KUNC\n\nVoters in Maine and a handful of other states are deciding whether to legalize recreational marijuana this November. One thing that could swing the vote is the possibility of millions of dollars in tax revenue from retail marijuana sales. Colorado was the first state in the country to roll out a tax scheme for legal marijuana in 2013, after recreational marijuana was legalized in 2012. So how are voters in Colorado spending the cash, and what should Maine voters expect?\n\nMaine, like a lot of other states, could always use more revenue, so the possibility of millions from legalizing marijuana is enticing. But many voters there are unsure how that money will be spent. Erin McGee Ferrell spoke to us in downtown Portland. McGee is a foster parent and says she doesn't get reimbursed much. She says that area is one state program that could use more funding.\n\nI know there's a lot of problems in terms of needing more money for health issues and people who are addicted to opioids. I mean, there's such a lack of money for children, and health issues, she says.\n\nThe mayor of Portland, Ethan Strimling, shares voters' concern. Specifically, he wants to know, how is the money from marijuana going to be dedicated to individual communities?\n\nAll we have at the local level is property taxes, Strimling says. It would be great if some of the revenue that's generated from this legalization could stay in the community where it's having the most impact.\n\nIn other words, to fund substance abuse programs to offset any of negative impact of legalization.\n\nIn Colorado, it's a mixed bag with regard to where the money from pot is spent.\n\nThe state has a slew of local and state taxes on retail marijuana. Almost everybody through the entire supply chain is paying into the system, including growers, testing laboratories and retail shops. To some extent, pot is paying for schools in Colorado, with much of the state tax revenue going toward school maintenance and construction - paying for things like new roofs and HVAC systems in rural school districts.\n\nBut Chris Stiffler, an analyst with the Colorado Fiscal Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, cautions against getting too excited about marijuana tax revenue.\n\nWe like to talk about it as if you were walking home today and you found a $20 bill on the ground, Stiffler explains. You wouldn't go home and buy a new car or new house. But you would maybe go out for a Chipotle burrito with guacamole and a margarita, right?\n\nHe says when voters in Colorado were considering legal marijuana, some of them thought that this was going to be a huge amount of money for education.\n\nThey want to know why they're not getting new schools, more teachers, why they're not getting better roads because they were promised so many marijuana dollars were going to fix and pay for the things that really drive their communities, Stiffler says.\n\nThe revenue is basically a drop in the bucket for the state budget. But for local communities, which can levy their own taxes on the marijuana industry, it appears that marijuana tax money can actually make more of a difference.\n\nTake Edgewater, Colorado, a small town of 5,300 people in the Denver metro area. The city has five retail marijuana shops and they're projected to bring in more than $1 million in marijuana tax revenue this fiscal year. To put that in perspective, their annual budget is $6 million, so that's one so that's one sixth that's coming from marijuana.\n\nMayor of Edgewater, Kris Teegardin says,Tax sales have been able to speed up major infrastructure improvements otherwise we that would have to take a very incremental approach to.\n\nOne of those improvements is road paving. Teegardin even jokes that maybe they should be paving the road in green to show people how their marijuana tax dollars are being spent. They're also putting money toward a brand new civic center and a police station. Other cities in Colorado are funding homelessness programs and mental health centers. But Teegardin is not banking on this money coming in forever.\n\nThis is something that we know could go away in the blink of an eye, he says. Or, it could have a downturn when other states legalize it or other municipalities decide to join, so we are really looking at a murky forecast for sales in the next three to four years.\n\nWith that in mind, tax analysts say the possibility of more revenue from pot shouldn't be the sole reason to support marijuana legalization because it may not be enough to solve big budgetary problems that states face.

You can sign up here.\n\nIn late January, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who's in the race to become president in 2020, added a new kind of tax to the American conversation, causing anxious pacing on superyachts in every port: a wealth tax. It's a cousin of the property tax, but it encompasses all forms of wealth: cash, stocks, jewelry, thoroughbred horses, jets, everything. Warren calls the policy her Ultra-Millionaire Tax. It would impose a 2% federal tax on every dollar of a person's net worth over $50 million and an additional 1% tax on every dollar in net worth over $1 billion. Economists estimate it would hit the 75,000 richest households and raise $2.75 trillion over ten years.\n\nIt's a direct attack on wealth inequality, and it's influenced by the work of French economist Thomas Piketty, whose book Capital in the Twenty-First Century put a spotlight on the increasing disparity of wealth in developed nations. Warren, who informally endorsed a wealth tax while at an event with Piketty in 2015, is the first U.S. presidential candidate to take up the cause.\n\nThe disparity in what Americans own is much greater than the disparity in what they earn. Jeff Bezos has a net worth of $135 billion, but his formal salary is less than $100,000 per year. Warren's proposal aims to tap the fortunes of the ultra-rich and use the proceeds to fund social programs. But a wealth tax faces serious hurdles, including lessons from a failed experiment in Europe, the need for significant bureaucratic expansion, and serious questions over whether it's even constitutional.\n\nEuro Flop\n\nNormally progressives like to point to Europe for policy success. Not this time. The experiment with the wealth tax in Europe was a failure in many countries. France's wealth tax contributed to the exodus of an estimated 42,000 millionaires between 2000 and 2012, among other problems. Only last year, French president Emmanuel Macron killed it.\n\nIn 1990, twelve countries in Europe had a wealth tax. Today, there are only three: Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. According to reports by the OECD and others, there were some clear themes with the policy: it was expensive to administer, it was hard on people with lots of assets but little cash, it distorted saving and investment decisions, it pushed the rich and their money out of the taxing countries—and, perhaps worst of all, it didn't raise much revenue.\n\nUC Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman, whose research helped put wealth inequality back on the American policy agenda, played a part in designing Warren's wealth tax. He says it was designed explicitly with European failures in mind.\n\nHe argues the Warren plan is very different than any wealth tax that has existed anywhere in the world. Unlike in the European Union, it's impossible to freely move to another country or state to escape national taxes. Existing U.S. law also taxes citizens wherever they are, so even if they do sail to a tax haven in the Caribbean, they're still on the hook. On top of that, Warren's plan includes an exit tax, which would confiscate 40 percent of all a person's wealth over $50 million if they renounce their citizenship.\n\nWarren's tax is also only limited to the super rich, whereas in Europe the threshold was low enough to also hit the sort-of rich. This higher threshold helps it avoid problems like someone having a family business that makes them look rich on paper but, in fact, they're short on the cash needed to pay the tax.\n\nAlso important, Zucman argues, the higher threshold means only a small group will be affected. And smaller groups have a harder time fighting for exemptions, which hurt European efforts. Some countries, for example, exempted artwork and antiques on the grounds they were hard to value. It's true, but it creates a huge loophole: Buy lots of art! Economists hate incentives like these because they distort markets. Warren's proposal calls for no exemptions.\n\nBureaucracy and the Constitution\n\nBut having no exemptions means the U.S. government will have to get very good at valuing art, diamonds, superyachts, and all the other fabulous things the super rich collect. Indeed, Warren's plan includes a call for a significant increase in the IRS enforcement budget. It was the hefty cost of enforcement that played a big part in Austria killing their wealth tax back in 1993. It turns out it costs a lot to track and value rich people's stuff every year.\n\nAnd a wealth tax may not even be legal. The ability of the federal government to tax is tightly curtailed by the U.S. Constitution. Legally imposing the first income tax in 1913 required a constitutional amendment. Legal scholars are currently debating whether a wealth tax would need another amendment. The debate, Josh Barro writes, centers on whether a wealth tax would be a direct tax, which the Constitution makes really hard for the federal government to impose.\n\nWhile the legality of a federal wealth tax is in question, the current politics of it are not. A new poll finds that even a majority of Republicans support Warren's wealth tax. It turns out President Trump himself once advocated for one too.\n\nA Local Problem with a Global Solution\n\nIt's been roughly five years since Piketty published Capital in the Twenty-First Century. One of the book's central arguments was that the rate of return on capital will be higher than the rate of economic growth (r>g) and, as a result, the wealthy will continue seeing their fortunes increase faster than everyone else's.\n\nHis solution was a wealth tax, but he recognized that exemptions and freedom of travel had doomed the European experiments. So he suggested a global wealth tax: The whole world would decide to do one thing at one rate. That such a solution is highly unlikely is a perfect symbol for the difficulty of getting money from people with the best accountants, the best lobbyists, and the best boats.\n\nDid you enjoy this newsletter?

History Shows Christmas Can Be A Powerful Motivator On Capitol Hill\n\nSince George Washington's raid on Trenton, the words Christmas, Washington and crisis have gone hand in hand.\n\nLAUREN FRAYER, HOST:\n\nIf Congress seems to have gotten more done in the last week than in the rest of the year, that may not be an accident. Christmas, or rather the possibility of missing Christmas, can be a powerful motivator on Capitol Hill. That's according to our NPR senior editor and correspondent Ron Elving, the man we call Professor Ron.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF THE CROSSING FILM)\n\nRON ELVING, BYLINE: The first time the words Washington, Christmas and crisis all came together in our history was our first December together as a nation, 1776, the year of the Declaration of Independence and the full-scale outbreak of the Revolutionary War.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, THE CROSSING)\n\nJEFF DANIELS: (As General Washington) We became a nation on the 4th of July, six months ago.\n\nELVING: Things were not going well for General Washington and his ragtag colonial army.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, THE CROSSING)\n\nDANIELS: (As General Washington) Since then we have lost New York. Congress has fled from Philadelphia because we cannot defend it. We have lost every battle.\n\nELVING: But in the stormy darkness of Christmas night...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, THE CROSSING)\n\nDANIELS: (As General Washington) I propose that on the eve of December 25th, we cross the river, march on Trenton.\n\nELVING: To attack an enemy outpost.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, THE CROSSING)\n\nDANIELS: (As General Washington) And if God is with us, we'll take the whole lot of them.\n\nELVING: They surprised and overwhelmed the opposing troops, many of whom were still recovering from the indulgences of Christmas Day. It is said that Washington got his troops pumped up for this midnight outing with readings of a new pamphlet by Thomas Paine, called, The American Crisis.\n\nPETER BRESLOW: (Reading) These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country, but he stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.\n\nELVING: It turns out the historical evidence for Paine's pamphlet actually being read to the troops on the banks of the Delaware that night is a little spotty, but we do know Paine's Crisis was in fact a part of George Washington's media mix. And the words themselves still stir American hearts, as they have in times of war and want for generations.\n\nBRESLOW: (Reading) Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered, yet we have this consolation with us that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.\n\nELVING: When George Washington became our first president, we took a little time to establish the dollar as the currency for all states, but that got done over a Christmas session. For generations thereafter, Congress remained technically in session over Christmas, not out of disrespect, but just in case urgent business might require it. And the prospect of needing a Christmas session helped make the preceding weeks and months more productive. Deadlines, of course, are made to be stretched, and sometimes things got out of hand. Take the first Christmas of Lyndon Johnson's presidency in 1963.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVAL NEWSREPORT)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED NEWSCASTER: Honorable wheat harvests are a way of life in the United States.\n\nELVING: The House got caught up wrangling over a foreign aid bill that included selling wheat to Russia, which in those days was still the Soviet Union.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVAL NEWS REPORT)\n\nNEWSCASTER: American ships are to carry the grain, and government officials say there will be other benefits to the economy.\n\nELVING: Some members had already left town and had to be summoned back to muster the necessary votes.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FESTIVE MUSIC)\n\nELVING: Johnson, who had spent more than 30 years toiling in the House and Senate himself, appreciated this special effort and threw a little Christmas party for the inconvenienced members.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS)\n\nJUDY GARLAND: (Singing) Have yourself a merry little Christmas.\n\nELVING: But back in town, members felt entitled to speechify on the floor, prompting one of the few women in Congress at that time, Katharine St. George of New York, to suggest that they all just put their remarks in writing in the Congressional Record. Future generations yet unborn will be able to see them, she said, but those of us who are here on this Christmas Eve need not listen to them.\n\nMore recently, the notion of Christmas carols being sung on the Senate floor got real in the first year of President Obama's presidency.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nBARACK OBAMA: I returned to speak to all of you about an issue that is central to that future, and that is the issue of health care. I am not the first president to take up this cause, but I am determined to be the last.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nELVING: President Obama's Affordable Care Act was passed on Christmas Eve of 2009.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOE BIDEN: The yeas are 60. The nays are 39. H.R.3590 has amended the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is passed.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nELVING: A few years later, conflicts between Obama and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives led to the so-called fiscal cliff. It was 2012. Obama had just been re-elected, and failure to strike a deal was about to cost taxpayers billions in spending cuts and tax increases. John Boehner, who was at the time the speaker of the House, exchanged offers and counteroffers with the White House.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOHN BOEHNER: Now, even if we did exactly what the president wants, we would see red ink for as far as the eye can see. Now, if the president doesn't agree with our approach, he's got an obligation to put forward a plan that can pass both chambers of the Congress.\n\nELVING: That showdown just five years ago kept a lot of people working in Washington straight through Christmas week and New Year's Eve until an agreement was struck. It might have gone down to the wire this year, too, but deals got done this past week and Congress finally got out of town.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, 'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS)\n\nLIBERACE: (Singing) And away they all flew, like the down of a thistle.\n\nELVING: But I heard them exclaim as they flew out of sight...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, 'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS)\n\nLIBERACE: Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.\n\nELVING: Ron Elving, NPR News, Washington.\n\nFRAYER: In addition to Professor Ron, you heard WEEKEND EDITION producer Peter Breslow reading Thomas Paine, and Jeff Daniels playing George Washington in The Crossing.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF LIBERACE'S 'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS)\n\nFRAYER: You're listening to WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR.

The Week Ahead In Politics\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nAmidst all the political turmoil, including top White House staffers resigning after reports of domestic abuse, tomorrow, the president will release his budget. Now, normally a presidential budget would be big news, but this time, it's a bit anticlimactic. Why? NPR political correspondent Mara Liasson is about to tell us. Good morning, Mara.\n\nMARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Lulu.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So it seems a little strange to be talking about why something doesn't matter, but here we are, saying President Trump's budget - which is being released tomorrow - suddenly isn't that important. How did that happen?\n\nLIASSON: Presidents' budgets are always political documents. They're not a piece of legislation, but they do express the president's priorities. And, of course, the cliche is to say that the president's budget is dead on arrival on Capitol Hill. This one is probably dead as a doornail. And the reason is that Republicans and Democrats just passed a massive, two-year spending bill, which raises the caps for domestic and defense spending. And the White House was mostly a bystander in those negotiations. So what the president says in his budget tomorrow will not affect spending very much. Congress probably won't be passing a 2019 budget resolution. The bottom line is, in this instance, Congress seems to be ignoring the president.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Oh, OK. But when the budget comes out tomorrow, the spotlight will probably turn to White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, right? He was famously hawkish on the deficit when he was in Congress. What will he have to say?\n\nLIASSON: Well, we're looking forward to what he has to say about this because he really personifies the total reversal by Republicans about deficit spending. They've done a 180-degree turn on this. Most economists say what they just did was fiscally irresponsible, exactly the opposite of what you want to do when the economy is booming, and there's low unemployment. You would rather run a small deficit or a surplus, so you have some room to spend if the economy does go into a recession, which - most economists think it will in the next couple of years because this expansion is getting so old. But instead, Republicans passed a tax cut that adds $1.5 trillion dollars to the deficit. Now the spending bill treasury just announced it's going to issue almost a trillion dollars of new debt next year. That's an 84 percent increase.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Wow.\n\nLIASSON: So this is exactly the kind of thing that Republicans railed against when Obama was in office. And Senator Rand Paul, in his brief effort to hold up that funding bill, asked, are we only for fiscal responsibility when we're in the minority? And I guess the answer is yes.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Yes. What about the issue of immigration, which is, of course, tied to budget deal-making in Congress right now? Where does that stand, and where does the president stand?\n\nLIASSON: President Trump has laid out four pillars of the deal that he wants after he lifted the protection from deportation for these young people called DREAMers or DACA recipients. They were protected from deportation by President Obama. Trump lifted that protection. He gave Congress a deadline of March 5 before he says he'll start deporting those kids. What Trump wants is a path to citizenship for these kids. In exchange, he wants an end to the diversity lottery, an end to family reunification migration - he calls it chain migration. And, of course, he wants funding for the wall.\n\nWhat's interesting is when you listen to people on Capitol Hill, including Republicans in Senate leadership, they are really only talking about two of the president's four pillars. In other words, they want border security and wall funding in exchange for some kind of a path to legalization or citizenship for the DREAMers. They think a smaller, more narrow deal is more doable. So most Republicans also think that Donald Trump will sign whatever Congress sends him on immigration. Otherwise, he has to start deporting the DREAMers. Either way, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has promised that he would put a bill on the floor this week with an open process. That means amendments, votes, old fashioned legislating - something we haven't seen in a very long time in Washington.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: Something to look forward to. NPR's political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thanks, Mara.\n\nLIASSON: Thank you.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: And elsewhere in our program, we'll get the details of that congressional spending bill.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.
