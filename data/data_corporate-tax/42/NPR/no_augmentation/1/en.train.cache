Many Massachusetts residents are wondering whether the state could revert to the law passed in 2006, which became a model for Obamacare. The individual mandate is still on the books, but the employer mandate and other elements were replaced with provisions in the federal law.
Still, there are some warning signs for the president among some of his key demographic groups. Only 52 percent of white, non-college-educated Americans approve of the job he's doing, though just 37 percent disapprove. And that is higher than most other subgroups. More worrisome for the president, among older Americans, 60 and older, he's underwater — 47 percent disapprove, while 43 percent approve.
SUAREZ: Julie Rovner is Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health News. Julie, thanks for joining us.
SAGAL: Why not? Can you imagine how exciting that would be for the young ladies of Washington to be looking at their Tinder and going oh my God, it's Cory Booker - right, right, right, right.

Their best chance is in Georgia's 6th District, where Republicans are scrambling to stop Democrat Jon Ossoff from winning the contest outright with a majority of the vote in an April 18 all-party primary.
They write: For both cities only a small fraction (5%) of trips need to be altered to reach equity situations...
JOHNNY ISAKSON: It's deplorable, what he said. That's what I called it from the floor of the Senate seven months ago. It will be deplorable seven months from now if he says it again. And I will continue to speak out.
I think we're going to save additional money that we would have had to spend on tracking down illegal immigrants and on immigration, Spicer said. So it's actually a huge win for the American taxpayer and for American security when you look at the kind of plan that's coming to fruition right now.
Trump Aims To Play Salesman During Davos Economic Forum
MCCAMMON: He called Romney irrelevant and someone who'd let down the Republican Party by losing to Barack Obama.
DUTTA-GUPTA: Well, basically, what the policies would do is they would allow the vast majority of families to access the child tax credit. This is reasonably well targeted in that the increases now are going to go to families with the lowest incomes, but it does really spread out benefits throughout the income spectrum. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy has just estimated that the bottom 60% of Americans by income would receive an increase in their incomes of 11% on average, and then the bottom 20% would receive an increase of 33% on average. So we are living through one of the largest boosts to family incomes, I think, that may have ever happened, at least at this pace, in U.S. history.
Now let's look at what the Obama-Clinton policies have done nationally. Their policies produced 1.2% growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression, it's been written about all over, it's a disaster and a doubling of the national debt during the Obama years. There are now 94.3 million Americans outside of the labor force. It was 80.5 million when President Obama took office, an increase of 14 million people.
Making Democrats' Primaries More Open Could Be Harder Than You Think
In Wisconsin, corrupt Democrat-run cities deployed more than 500 illegal, unmanned, unsecured drop boxes, which collected a minimum of 91,000 unlawful votes. It was razor-thin, the loss. This one thing alone is much more than we would need. But there are many things.
Having said that, there was certainly a period not that long ago when you had a significant number of Republicans who, although generally, you know, they don't like taxes, they don't like regulation, nevertheless bought into the idea that we should have some kind of universal coverage system and really focus on, OK, well, how can we do this in a way that kind of fits what we prefer about how the world works? So maybe we do it through private insurance instead of public insurance. And we do - we don't make it so generous so it doesn't cost so much money. And you kind of go down the list.
But until this year, she says they never heard about housing policy or possible solutions.
KELLY: OK, but sell me on this. When you say cutting by half or two-thirds, you're still talking about an increase in the federal deficit of - what? - something like four...
In a statement on Saturday, Delta said it was reaching out to the NRA to let them know we will be ending their contract for discounted rates through our group travel program.
Most people in America believe you can either fight terrorism — i.e., identify and get the terrorists — or you can protect our civil liberties — i.e., make sure the government isn't looking at our personal information when they are not allowed to, says Palantir Technologies CEO Alex Karp. And that dichotomy used to be true. We've found a way to tag information so the only people who can see it are those who are allowed to see it, so it takes care of that problem.
SYKES: But the bigotry and the xenophobia and the misogny. And I say this as a conservative. Look. I like tax cuts. I like cuts in regulation. But what we've seen this year is we have seen a president and the Republican Party acquiesced to him align themselves with forces that, I think, represent some of the darker impulses of American society.
In the end, neither side got its desired outcome, as reporter Emily Sullivan of member station WYPR tweeted.
The FDA is seeking $80 million to support operational and response needs including mitigating drug shortages and pre- and postmarket work on vaccines and therapies.
The GOP leadership had been pushing for an 18-month deal on the debt ceiling, looking to send a message of stability but also to push the issue beyond next year's midterm elections.
As for a donor like Wareham, he still wants to beat Trump. After ticking through the candidates left in the race, he said, You are kind of left with two folks that have solid records and are possibilities for everyone in a similar situation to me — they are John Kasich and Marco Rubio.
FAHRENTHOLD: Yes. I talked to a trustee of that foundation, actually the widow of the person who established it. And she said that, you know, they like Trump, and they thought he was raising money for the Palm Beach Police Foundation.
As of today, 152 countries across the globe are affected by this new virus and over 7,000 people have lost their lives to it, the World Health Organization's regional director for Europe said Tuesday, describing the reach of a coronavirus that is disrupting lives in countries around the world.
Justin Schrager is an emergency physician at Emory University Hospital. And Rachel Patzer is an epidemiologist at Emory University. Good morning, guys.
We proved that we are still a people capable of doing big things, the president said a short while later in televised remarks. We proved that this government — a government of the people and by the people — still works for the people.
LIASSON: Donald Trump and his Twitter feed loom over the 2018 elections, and there's nothing Republicans can do about that. Midterm elections are often reactions against the president and the party in power. That's what happened to Barack Obama and the Democrats in 2010 and 2014. And President Trump has yet to prove how he helps Republicans when he's not on the ballot. Mara Liasson, NPR News, the White House.
But to what end? There aren't much more than two options when it comes to overhauling health care — government-run single-payer or a market-based hybrid system similar to the Affordable Care Act.
WARREN: We need to bring our troops home, and then we need to make a big shift. We cannot ask our military to keep solving problems that cannot be solved militarily.
MCCAIN: It's a rare and wonderful experience and one that I'll always treasure and not look back either in - with anger or remorse because of the fact that I was a loser. I was able - we were able to motivate millions of young Americans to be involved in politics again and - for example, in the Michigan primary, 300,000 voters who voted had never voted in their lives. And so I'm grateful for the experience.

SAGAL: Yeah, yeah, that's so great. Tell us about the Hot Pockets.
We are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that are now parked overseas they can't bring their money back into our country. Our plan will bring that cash home, applying only a 10 percent tax. This money will be re-invested in states like Michigan, states like Michigan which are having serious problems. Finally, no family will have to pay the death tax. American workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death – it's just plain wrong. And most people agree with that. We will repeal it.

That may help keep costs down, though in some states it also means the network of doctors would likely not be as large as that found with Medicare or some commercial plans.
One case that Clinton critics point to involves banking giant UBS, which was locked in a tense battle with the Internal Revenue Service when Clinton took office in 2009. The Wall Street Journal published a detailed look at Clinton's dealings with the bank:

California Lawmakers Consider Abortion Pills On Campus
Exciting news before we start the show - we are doing a live taping of our podcast at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C., on November 8. Go to nprpresents.org to get your tickets now. Now let's talk about that Democratic debate in Texas that was hosted by ABC News.
PETE BUTTIGIEG: When we lost troops in Niger, there were members of Congress who admitted they didn't even know we had troops there. And it was all pursuant to an authorization that was passed to deal with al-Qaida and Sept. 11. And often, Congress has been all too happy to leave aside its role.
SIEGEL: ...Part of a law passed by the Congress.
It has become commonplace, however, for Putin's supporters to say that, in so many words, everyone does it, i.e. all nations interfere in all other nations' affairs. That was the line, for example, taken by Russia supporter Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., in an interview with Bloomberg News.
But once again, the current economy is not anemic, as President Trump often reminds Americans.
Tax breaks for small businesses were still a critical issue in the final hours of negotiation. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told reporters he was working with negotiators on the conference committee to ensure the new tax system doesn't give corporations an unfair advantage over businesses that decide to file their taxes on the individual side of the tax code.
The Trump administration has insisted that the Justice Department wants responses to the question to better enforce a part of the Voting Rights Act that protects racial and language minorities against discrimination.
Talking with reporters Thursday, the president said he was very surprised by the FBI raid at Manafort's home and said it sent a strong signal. Trump also said that the White House is cooperating with the special counsel probe even though, he said, the subjects under investigation never happened.

Finding Mr. Manafort guilty was hard for me. I wanted him to be innocent. I really wanted him to be innocent — but he wasn't, Duncan said. That's the part of a juror. You have to have due diligence and deliberate and look at the evidence and come up with an informed and intelligent decision, which I did.
We avoid speaking to groups where the appearance itself might put in question our impartiality. This includes situations where our appearance may seem to endorse the agenda of a group or organization, as well as participation in some political debates and forums where the sponsoring groups or other participants are identified with a particular perspective on an issue.
MARTIN: OK, President Trump's Supreme Court pick - that would be Justice Neil Gorsuch, the newest member of the court - he is expected to give a speech today to a conservative group here in Washington, D.C.
That's still an unlikely outcome, but if Democrats keep the race in ruby red Kansas close, it could give them more momentum and optimism heading into Georgia the following week.
The legislation boosts unemployment benefits, with nearly $1 billion in state grants to cover processing and paying unemployment insurance.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: We spent some time talking to groups important to both Democrats and Republicans there. We chatted with dairy farmers at the state fair and black voters in Milwaukee neighborhoods. And yes, we ate some cheese curds. We'll bring you those stories elsewhere in the program. But first, President Trump is still in Bedminster, N.J., this morning at what the White House is at pains to call a working vacation. He's due back in Washington tomorrow, just missing the one-year anniversary of the deadly rally in Charlottesville, Va., which is being marked in both Charlottesville and here in D.C.

Writing in 1955 about the disappearance of two U.K. Foreign Officers, Fairlie used the term to describe the powerful people, who, among other things, defended the officers' families from the press.
If interest rates rise, the situation Trump described, the market value of long-term debt falls. For example, a 30-year bond issued in 2015 at an interest rate of less than 3.0 percent, might sell for less than 70 percent of its nominal value if the long-term interest rate crosses 6 or 7 percent, which it certainly could. The Treasury could buy up long-term debt in the market at its current market value, and replace it with new debt that paid a higher interest rate. This won't change the interest payments owed by the government, but it would reduce the nominal value of the debt outstanding.
MARTIN: How would this work to address your money management skills?
And here's what he says about the whole experience — he actually brags about it: Atlantic City was a very good cash cow for me for a long time. ... The money I took out of there was incredible.

COHN: Yeah. Well, the most famous one, it was on abortion rights. You know, she's a staunch defender of abortion rights, has been for, you know, her career. When - you know, as she was moving a bill through, it became very apparent they did not have the votes unless they convince a group of Democrats who oppose abortion rights. And, you know, the actual - you know, the big issue came down to federal funding of abortion rights, which always comes - of abortion, which comes up every time there's a health care bill.

After State Of The Union, Spotlight Will Turn To Michigan's Democratic Governor
LIASSON: This is causing Republicans to just tear their hair out. Recently, 50 Republicans wrote an open letter to the RNC saying you should cut off funding for the Trump campaign, focus on saving our House and Senate seats. That follows a letter from 50 national security officials from former Republican administrations saying that they think Donald Trump would be a reckless president and a national security threat. So a lot of pessimism of Republicans.
Web producer Heidi Glenn and Morning Edition editor Jacob Conrad contributed to this report.
A big unknown is how aggressive Trump would remain in going beyond rhetorically opposing Obamacare, said Thomas Miller, a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. His report card as a presidential candidate reads, 'Donald needs to improve his attention, effort, and study habits. He is easily distracted and seems to prefer just picking fights with others.' 
INSKEEP: Very interesting and that's just the beginning of the story. David, thanks as always.
There will be a broad public education effort, so that people understand what's in the legislation, says Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer group that lobbied for the bill. As a result, I think there's going to be growing and substantial support for the reform.
In December, Hunter Biden announced the Delaware U.S. attorney's office was investigating his tax affairs.
SHAPIRO: Bethany, what do you think of this tactically? The trade talks seemed to have been moving in a positive direction before President Trump raised the tariffs from 10 to 25 percent. Do you think that was a smart move?
ROMNEY: He inherited his business. He didn't create it. And whatever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then there's Trump magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks and Trump Mortgage. A business genius he is not.

LAFFER: Well, yeah. That's what we were talking about earlier. And what I'd like to do is see us get rid of all these deductions, exemptions, exclusions and loopholes and lower the rate dramatically. And you'd create enormous growth in the United States. That's exactly what we need.

AFC awarded high marks to Florida's program for its broad eligibility, reaching families with incomes of up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level; for the generosity of the tax break to donors, a dollar-for-dollar match with a cap that increases automatically each year; and for the large size of scholarships, nearly $6,000.
GRAVES: In those states you have a majority of Democrats and Democratic governors, and so you do have an atmosphere that's less hostile to this clamoring for addressing these wage issues. But I think that that's huge. Those are two enormous states and those states are, you know, moving forward with an increase in the minimum wage, which has not been increased for many, many, many years in California. There's a staging in of that increase over the next six years approximately. And so you're going to see those laws take effect over these coming years in California.
Bus drivers in Detroit refuse to work, citing lack of protections
So museums, cinemas, theaters, gyms are closed through April 3. Schools and universities are closed. Bars and restaurants can stay open until 6 p.m. Soccer matches are suspended. Malls and supermarkets are closed on weekends. And freedom of movement from one municipality to another will require signing a police form self-certifying why you're traveling. And the only justifications are work, health and emergencies, and violators can risk up to three months in jail or fines of about $200.
MARTIN: What occurs to me is that it seems to - it seems to require a lot of personal information. It seems to require that you give up a lot of personal information to this device or to this program, including about your friends. And I'm wondering, are people really going to do that?
And then we're walking through empty airports and wondering, how long this can last? she says.
However, if Ossoff doesn't win, that isn't a signal, either, of Democratic fortunes in 2018. Democrats have plenty of other targets beyond Georgia's 6th District to put the House in play, as well. Midterm elections of a first-term president are a referendum on the commander in chief, and if Trump's approval continues to sink and his administration continues to be mired in controversy, there will by myriad opportunities for Democrats.
It's also an issue in West Virginia, where teachers went on strike in mid-February to protest a bill that could have paved the way for charter schools and private school vouchers in the state.
Under the Senate plan, drug companies would see an estimated $25.7 billion cut over 10 years, while medical device makers would get about $19.6 billion in savings. Some of the cuts would start as early as this calendar year.
While we can't comment until we see legislation introduced, the principles outlined in the recent co-sponsors memo represent an important next step toward valuing the carbon-free energy that nuclear energy provides Pennsylvania, said David Marcheskie, a spokesman for Exelon's Three Mile Island nuclear plant. The loss of these plants would cost the Commonwealth $4.6 billion annually in the form of increased pollution, higher electricity prices to consumers, lost jobs and reduced economic activity.
So Americans, relatively speaking, are more satisfied with the amount of taxes they pay than they have been at most other times in history, Newport said. Some people might say now's the time to pounce.
SIMON: A poet gets a break on the sales tax on his or her book but not when they buy Cheerios.
He's at James Madison University in southwest Virginia to talk about a small-family ethic — to question the assumptions of a society that sees having children as good, throws parties for expecting parents, and in which parents then pressure their kids to give them grandchildren.
MONTAGNE: OK. Well, go ahead. Will Donald Trump's supporters care about his taxes?
RACHEL MADDOW: Do you believe that part of the motivation to get rid of Ambassador Yovanovitch, to get her out of post, was because she was in the way of this effort to get the government of Ukraine to announce investigations of Joe Biden?

And the fact that the government has reached out to WASH United and other groups to help craft this policy is one of the best aspects of working on menstrual hygiene in Kenya, Mademba says.

A working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in April 2019 estimated that raising the minimum wage and the earned income tax credit by 10% each could prevent 1,230 people from dying by suicide each year.
INSKEEP: Well, let's just put Margaret Hoover's proposition on the table then, Robert Costa. What about this notion, that many Republicans seem to have, that if Trump is nominated, it will somehow break up or destroy the party?
He credits the recent spike in expatriation, then, in part to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, a 2010 act that ramped up enforcement of tax laws and, in his word, flushed people out of the bushes.

Instead, there were two rounds of staff layoffs.
JOHNSON: And as you pointed out this judge, T.S. Ellis III, has a need for speed. Prosecutor Greg Andres in particular really raced through his questions to cut to the chase today. This is the heart of the bank fraud and tax fraud case against Manafort. But remember; he denies wrongdoing.
Semantic bleaching has happened for nonpolitical words, like literally, and more political phrases, like politically correct and woke (a word NPR's Sam Sanders eulogized in 2018).

DETROW: And if that's angering critics, it sounds like this next aspect is as well. There are also these new tax breaks signed into law last year that are meant to help companies struggling because of the pandemic. But it sounds like at least one of these companies is trying to use these tax breaks as well, even though these payouts are the result, of course, of corporate behavior, critics say, fueled the addiction crisis.
SCHUMER: No, because the unemployment insurance is right there. You could do both together. Ours is longer term, much more targeted and would help deal with this in the long run. Just the one $1,000 check - you can pay your rent and buy your food in April, and what are you doing in May?
Expanded tax credits for low-income workers without children: The bill would expand the Earned Income Tax Credit for childless workers. Anyone 19 or older earning up to $11,610 would be eligible for $1,502. The legislation would increase both the income threshold and the amount of the payment.
SAGAL: Cory Booker's book United is out now. Sen. Cory Booker, thank you so much for joining us here on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
OSNOS: Right. Well, I think a lot of us were very wary of the idea that Trump as president would actually do a lot of the things that he said as a candidate partly because he was, you know, obviously from way outside the mainstream and - of previous presidents. So perhaps the political science was useless. But there are a couple of things that I think are important to keep in mind. One is that the appointment of Steve Bannon as chief strategist and a counselor to the president is an extension of something that was very clear when this piece was written, which was that Donald Trump will move around on a lot of issues. He's fluid, for instance, on what he would do on the technical basis of an H-1B visa, for instance, or whether or not he would allow school teachers to carry guns in the classroom.
But the order he signed was less substantive than he signaled.

Italy, which is grappling with the worse outbreak outside of China, has had more than 10,000 reported cases and a death toll exceeding 600. The country has instituted a sweeping lockdown and most commercial activity has stopped.
From James Tobin to Larry Summers, a long line of economists has supported the idea of a financial transaction tax. In his magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, John Maynard Keynes expressed his enthusiasm for one. The proper social purpose of Wall Street, he said, is to direct new investment into the most profitable channels in terms of future yield. But when it begins to resemble the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done. Hello, GameStop.

Scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international NGOs that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict-affected areas such as Syria and Yemen.
Trump Touts Economic Gains, As Trade War Looms
Cohn's exact departure date is not set, but White House aides say it will be in a few weeks.
Other university administrators across the country appear to be just as appalled as students — the American Council on Education sent a letter to Congress decrying the plan. The letter was signed by over 30 academic organizations, including the Association of American Universities, the Council for Advancement and Support of Education and the American Psychological Association.
When Republicans next controlled government, we'd be able to repeal every bill that had just been rammed through, McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor. And we'd set about defending the unborn, exploring domestic energy, unleashing free enterprise, defunding sanctuary cities, securing the border, protecting workers' paychecks from union bosses. You get the picture.
The ad buy comes at a time when Trump is polling behind Clinton in several key battleground states. In Colorado and Virginia, Clinton has a substantial lead in recent polls — so strong that a superPAC supporting her recently pulled ads from those states.
SAGAL: This week, Dara Khosrowshahi was picked as the new CEO of ride-share company blank.
Rather than waiting for benefits to trickle down, the COVID relief package showers money on lower-income households, boosting income for the poorest 20% of families by an average of 20%, according to the Tax Policy Center's analysis, while top earners would see their income rise less than 1%.
All great American programs, everything from The Great Society to The New Deal, started with a vision for our future, said co-sponsor Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
MAYER: Oh, McConnell has been incredibly important to Trump. He's made Trump's administration look like it was competent because they got legislative victories and these judges through. They got the huge tax cuts for corporations. And so for four years, really, McConnell has enabled Trump. And so this turn against Trump is really dramatic in the final day just before Biden was to be inaugurated.
It was definitely a very vulnerable situation that I was in, says Harvey, it's not easy to talk about when you're struggling, especially knowing that so many people were struggling at one time.

Trump is the first sitting U.S. president to attend the Davos summit since Bill Clinton went in 2000.
Gutierrez says he is not predicting precipitous changes but adds that he can't speak to the future. Every day is a good day of coverage.
DOUCLEFF: Yeah. So about 400 of those cases, the vast majority, are linked to two outbreaks in New York - one in Brooklyn and one in Rockland County, north of the city. As you mentioned before, the city has declared a public health emergency and is actually calling for mandatory vaccinations. So adults and kids have to get vaccinated, else families could be fined. The CDC also points to outbreaks in Washington state, Michigan, New Jersey and several parts of California.
Chaos without a strategy is a prescription for disaster, said Leon Panetta, who was chief of staff during the Clinton administration.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Job numbers just came out. And they're incredible. The job numbers were tremendous.
But Trump's plan does the opposite, says Lily Batchelder, a law professor at New York University and visiting fellow at the Tax Policy Center.
The messaging that a woman's genitalia needs constant upkeep — with things like special feminine washes, douches, hair removers, wipes and tighteners — is mostly promoted by companies that want to make women feel insecure so they'll buy something, she explains. If our genitalia required special care, we never would have evolved this way. In general, Gunter says, it's a bad idea to rely on information from a source that's also trying to sell you something.
OSNOS: The presidency is a unique office, to state the obvious. There is nobody who has the power to overrule the president, for instance, on nuclear authority. There are others in the chain of command who, if the president was incapacitated or disabled in some way would be able to use the nuclear arsenal. But they would have to do it in cooperation with others.
CORLEY: Jim Kaitschuk is the executive director of the Illinois Sheriffs' Association.
Pence said White House officials would fan out and talk to lawmakers to move the economic relief package forward.
GOLDWEIN: States like Nevada and Hawaii and Alaska and Texas are not doing very well. States like California have a $25 billion surplus. Idaho has had the fastest revenue growth it's seen in years. So there really are big differences between the states.
It would also be $448 billion larger than the CBO was projecting in September. Congress tacked on an extra $900 billion in spending in late December when they passed an additional coronavirus relief plan. The cost of the plan, however, is partly offset by a stronger-than-expected economic recovery.
I don't think anybody is desperate to pay more taxes, except maybe a few very rich people, said Gallup's Frank Newport. I guess Barack Obama always says, 'I make a lot of money and I'm willing to pay more taxes.' So maybe he'd be willing to do it. But most Americans aren't.
KELLY: It sounds like this newest plan to overhaul health care is very much a moving target. Like, you're going to have an interesting week coming up.
If Trump is embracing Ryan's plan, it would be a reversal. Just 10 days ago, he told the Wall Street Journal that a border adjustment tax was too complicated.
Their conclusion: Tax increases can hurt a region's economy, but no evidence exists that tax cuts spur growth.
However, the deal taking shape would include free coverage for coronavirus testing, extended unemployment insurance, paid sick leave and expanded food assistance as the pandemic takes a larger toll on the U.S. and global economies.
Where was the Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, and Sabine and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other, it's so sad to even be talking about it, because we can solve this problem so quickly. Where was the sanctuary for all of the Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly? These wounded American families have been alone. But they are not alone any longer.
Hillary Clinton campaigned Monday in Ohio, where she is facing unfavorable demographic trends as she tries to claim a state that President Obama won twice. But her major focus was a response to Donald Trump's tax story.
Ahead of Thursday's sentencing, her lawyers submitted a 13-minute video to the judge in which she apologizes and says the nearly yearlong legal saga created a ringing negativity in the city of Baltimore.
Senate action on the reconciliation bill will be marked by extensive parliamentary maneuvering. But Democrats are optimistic about their chances in that chamber.
The judge's ruling came hours after Trump met with lawmakers at the White House, to discuss the DACA program and other immigration issues.
It was a rough August for President Trump. His White House staff has been hollowed out; he was roundly criticized for his divisive response to the violence in Charlottesville, Va.; and he heads into fall weakened politically with abysmal approval ratings and doubts about his leadership and presidency.
The poll, released the day before Americans' taxes are due, delved into what Americans know and what they believe is wrong with the U.S. tax code — and what they know is limited and at times contradictory. But this isn't just about pointing out what Americans know and don't know. Rather, there could be important policy implications to Americans' misperceptions about the tax system. For example, this question dovetails with questions about what people think the lowest-income Americans' tax rate should be.
But the most fundamental motivation here, says McAlevey, is as simple as a pendulum swing. Everyone is just done with having no money. There's nowhere to go but up.
Investors are spooked by the growing number of infections outside China, and the possible economic fallout if the epidemic cannot be contained. Growing clusters of coronavirus have been diagnosed in South Korea, Italy, and Iran.
BROOKS: Yeah, I thought it was interesting because you got to see Trumpism the thing without Trump the clownish behavior. So it was like a straight-on view - our first sort of straight-on view. What struck me first was how un-Republican it was. The Republican Party has had three big units, all of whom were repudiated by the speech. Social conservatives got nary a mention. Fiscal hawks - he's spending a lot of money. Foreign policy hawks - he does not believe in a lot of our alliances. But what he believes in is a strong government. He's - it's for a lot of big government. But it's very forceful father figure, very rough government against their enemies.
But one of the funders, who helped raise millions of dollars for a superPAC supporting Jeb Bush, talked on the record with NPR's Morning Edition -- and gave his version of what he felt went wrong.
A Focus On The Net Benefit
The bill took a hit last week when the Congressional Budget Office said it would increase premiums in the short run, provide plans with less coverage and very likely cause millions to lose their health insurance. Kentucky is a state with lots of Trump voters, and he will be tested on his ability to convince them that this bill — or something else — is something they should support.
GILES: And you'll hear that from legislative Democrats, too, as they try in vain to stop some of these bills from passing. Republicans control both chambers of the legislature here.
Facebook's News Feed, which is how most users see content through the app and site, is more likely to prominently display content based on a user's previous interests, and it also conforms to his or her political ideology. A Wall Street Journal interactive from May of this year shows just how much your feed is affected by your political leanings.
Let's catalog just a few of the questions facing the nation's news organizations:
I hope that the legislators of northeastern Pennsylvania, who should have known better and yet still voted for this bill, will wake up, said Rabbi Daniel Swartz of Scranton. See through the fog of methane lies.
And look, I remember when Bill Clinton ran for president. And, you know, he had the - Putting People First was just a couple sheets of paper. And then, you know, as the campaign went on and he became president, he really filled in the blanks. President Trump is now filling in some of those...
The Trump administration seeks a total of $500 million for lost operating revenue for Amtrak. Half of that would be for the passenger rail line's operations in the Northeast corridor between Washington D.C and Boston, and half for it's operations in the rest of the country.
And, you know, in the course of the campaign, we saw moments when he would do things impulsively. He would say something in an interview on a subject that he didn't know very much about and would then find himself having to backpedal. So, for instance, when he talked about the idea of punishing women who get abortions and then was informed later that that was contrary to precedent and legal norms that he had to sort of walk that back. If you put that into a national security context, there's going to be enormous pressure on his staff to ensure that he does not do things which his authority allows him to do before he has all the information that's possible.
The Democrats failed Tuesday evening as the Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee rejected such an investigation. A party-line vote ended a long day of wrangling, barely two hours before the president took the rostrum in the House chamber for his address to Congress.
And I was just re-elected to the Senate in the last election in 2004. I campaigned for the people of Arizona. So let me represent you and your interests and your values and your ambitions, not look back in anger at something that happened in a primary in South Carolina. Not only do I not hold a grudge, as you know, I campaigned very vigorously for the re-election of President Bush. And I was glad to do so.
You know what I'm talking about. Well, you have heard of right-to-work laws. Well, they are wrong for workers and they're wrong for America. None of this is right, my friends. But this election is a chance for us to make it right for the future, for our kids and our grandkids.
MARTIN: Let me just briefly ask Fernando about that 'cause we only have about a minute left. Fernando, many people, including Congressman Luis Gutierrez, who's been a guest on your program, as well - a congressman from Chicago, who is Puerto Rican, by the way, is not an immigrant - says that the president has not done as much as he could do on this point, even though he's talked a good game, but has not delivered, and your thoughts about that.
CORNISH: But given what you've just described, I mean how complicated would a sale be, right?
The plan keeps some popular parts of Obamacare. It allows parents keep their children on their policies until age 26 and requires insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions.
That's where Jim Barrett lives, about 40 miles away in Bradford County on what he describes as a pretty typical mountain farm.
It took a very, very slow moving process from the 1970s until today to get women where they are professionally, Miller says. I do worry that this has erased so much of it so quickly that it could be a massive setback for decades.
SIMON: It was also a week, though, we have to note, that includes the largest single-day loss in stock market history. And in a way, it's tied into the Russia investigation, isn't it?
For far too long, Washington has ignored and left behind the American working class, Rubio tweeted.
Not everyone holds equal sacrifice as a guiding principle of tax policymaking. Several 2016 Republican presidential candidates proposed flat taxes of some sort, for example (though some of those people included some sort of an offsetting deduction for lower earners). Candidates have many arguments they cite for why their tax plans are best: spurring economic growth, for example, or simplifying the tax code.
And what they did in many cases is, they did fraud. They took the date and they moved it back so that it no longer is after Election Day. And more than 60,000 ballots in Pennsylvania were reported received back. They got back before they were ever supposedly mailed out. In other words, you got the ballot back before you mailed it, which is also logically and logistically impossible, right?
Then you're putting your thumb on the scale against workers, Acemoglu says.
State Senate introduces a nuclear bailout bill, similar to $500 million proposal from House last month
In an attempt to ease the financial strain on working Americans and small businesses, the president offered a handful of proposals he said would be presented to Congress in the coming days. These include a $50 billion program to provide low-interest loans to small businesses affected by the coronavirus.
Nitasha Mehta is the head of vendor marketing for the company and lobbies around the country, including Nevada and Ohio, where she testified in support of anti-tampon-tax bills. There is a trend starting to occur, she says.

And I'll tell you. Thank you very much, John. Fantastic job. I watched. That's a tough act to follow, those two. John is one of the most brilliant lawyers in the country, and he looked at this and he said, What an absolute disgrace that this can be happening to our Constitution.
So something that I don't want to be in that path, you know, since I'm putting a lot of effort for all those years. I don't know why I don't have a path. So I don't know why the government doesn't clarify for people they have doing the right thing here, paying tax, doing everything correct like a regular American citizen. But we still don't have - we don't have any idea how can we get it, how can we become a citizen, how we can get a green card. You know, of course, there is certain situations that you're going to go through and apply for other fees and everything else...
DAVIS: It's a different tone because he's taking a tone. Right? You know, the president has remained completely silent, particularly on Twitter, against the Roy Moore allegations. White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the president believes it's up to the people of Alabama to make a decision in this, even though so many Republicans wanted the president to weigh in on Roy Moore and to ask him to step aside. They were hoping he would do that. He's chosen not to.
The number of economic reports published by ERS has dropped by half. NIFA administered university research isn't getting the guidance or scrutiny it once did. Experienced staffers like Desiree Rucker at NIFA say they are running on fumes.
Music: Starlight. Find us: Twitter/ Facebook
That's not all. Donald Trump actually stood on a debate stage and said Americans' wages are too high.
The third way you do it is, is you have a huge coalition, that they are engaged in a political dance. And the reason you have to raise the heat is - Reagan used to say that his job was to turn up the light for the American people so they would turn up the heat on Congress. That really was how he governed.
What Trump has done is he's brought out a lot of vitriol about people of color, people living in poverty, she says. And that kind of attitude will make it easier for the Republicans to cut health care benefits and food stamp benefits for the most vulnerable Americans.
The opportunity is to be honest about that, to recognize that, and to positively exploit that, says Jeffrey Solomon, president of the Andrea and Charles Bronfman Philanthropies and author of The Art of Giving: Where the Soul Meets a Business Plan. In the best case, Solomon says, the reward for giving would be a nourished soul, rather than increased shoe sales. But if you want folks to give, he says, you have to show them what's in it for them.
As the conservative political columnist Salena Zito wrote of Trump in September, the press takes him literally, but not seriously; his supporters take him seriously, but not literally. She has been writing for months about the depths of Trump's support. One such column in August was titled: Stumped by Trump's success? Take a drive outside US cities.
While the Clinton campaign hasn't outright disputed the contents of the emails, they have not yet confirmed their authenticity. Podesta did take to Twitter questioning the veracity of some of the emails, though he didn't specify which ones. He wrote that he didn't have the time to verify which emails are true and which are fake, and he also blamed Russia for the hack, claiming the country has been issuing cyber attacks as a means to throw the election to Donald Trump.

I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb.
ELVING: Well, the president, of course, defended his handling of Charlottesville - said this week he had spoken perfectly at that time. And yes, the president clearly takes this challenger more seriously than most all the other 20 or so. He regards him more like a peer. He's given him a nickname - sleepy Joe. And he says he would beat him easily. But for all his denials, the president is clearly a consumer of polls. And he doubtless knows that there were many polls this week showing Biden ahead of him in a hypothetical matchups. One saying possibly by as much as eight points.
Cohen repeatedly stressed all he had lost through actions he had taken and choices he made during 10 years working as Trump's personal attorney — not just the jail time he's facing, but fearing for his family's safety, losing his business and now being disbarred.
But even if Republicans do regain control of one or both chambers, they still would have to contend with Obama's potential veto of any major changes to the law, at least for two more years. And getting such changes to the president's desk might be just as problematic as passing the health bills in the first place.
According to historian Susan Mattern, when women in premodern, agrarian societies would exit their reproductive age, it was viewed as an upgrade — an entrance into a really important life phase. Mattern is the author of The Slow Moon Climbs: The Science, History, and Meaning of Menopause.
Now the owner of several restaurants, she says, They said that to the wrong girl. It just made me more determined to show that I could get into a French kitchen and kill it. It was a turning point for me.

KHALID: I mean, leading into this debate, there was a news story that had begun to make the rounds that Bernie Sanders had told Elizabeth Warren in a private meeting that they had to discuss the 2020 race that he allegedly did not think a woman could be president. He was asked about that comment last night. He flat out denied that he had ever made such a remark.
GURIAN: By which he means taxpayers.
Moore voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, but during the last presidential election, he became enamored with Donald Trump's promise to bring back jobs and renegotiate trade deals. He thought tariffs in the abstract would be beneficial, but now that they could hurt the company he works for, he thinks the Trump administration needs to re-evaluate the idea.
The view from Kevin Patterson, the CEO of Connect for Health Colorado, might be summarized as sunny with storm clouds on the horizon. I think we're feeling like things are going really well, he says.
As cameras focused in on the commentator's apparently surprised face, the president then went on to say that instead of waiting for a White House ceremony to mark the honor, he was making it official in the middle of his speech.
You work hard, you do your part, you will get ahead and stay ahead. And we need to make sure that basic bargain is alive and well in 2016.

For months, the mostly peaceful protests in Delhi have often been a sea of colorful turbans. Punjab is the birthplace of the Sikh faith, and a majority of its residents follow that religion. On Jan. 26, when clashes erupted between protesters and police, activists raised a Sikh flag over India's historic Red Fort – a symbol of power. Indian authorities seized on that flag to denounce the protesters as dangerous separatists.
The $1.9 trillion relief package passed by Congress on Wednesday is expected to give a substantial boost to the world's largest economy once it's signed by President Biden, putting more money in people's pockets just as an improving pandemic outlook opens new avenues for them to spend it.
Disclosures: This story was reported by NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik and edited by NPR Tech and Media Editor Emily Kopp. Because of NPR CEO John Lansing's prior role as CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, no senior news executive or corporate executive at NPR reviewed this story before it was published. Additionally, former NPR CEO Kevin Klose was twice president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and a signatory of the letter to President-elect Biden.
Now, because of the rise of the dollar and the pensions people aren't receiving, there are two classes of people, he says. A poor class and a rich class.

In the final sprint before Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, Democratic presidential candidates are taking a more sharply negative tone about their rivals than they have up until now.
TRUMP: They're always considering negotiations. But they've been negotiating now for 25 years. Look at Clinton. He folded on the negotiations. He was weak and ineffective. You look what happened with Bush. You look what happened with Obama. Obama, he didn't want to talk about it. But I talk. It's about time. Somebody has to do it.
David Ianacone, the health care administrator at Center for Extended Care in Amherst, acknowledged the termination. She could not do the work, he told NPR. Her health did not permit her to return.
HORSLEY: ...President Trump saying - exactly. But I'm sure that the knives will be out and the finger pointing will start when the microphones are turned off.
LONNIE BUNCH: And often when I think about political issues, I'll also raise it with David to get his guidance.
The question of unspent funds also hangs over the debate regarding $350 billion in additional support for state and local governments.

Cohen, at one time one of Trump's closest advisers and a self-described fixer, used his public testimony before the House Oversight Committee to detail how far he went to protect Trump — and his 2016 presidential campaign — from potential scandals, as well as to help inflate estimates of Trump's personal net worth.
So you know, right now I'm doing this all without Justin. And that's definitely a struggle to, you know, do not only the work at home but also, you know, I'm worried about Justin's safety and well-being, of course, knowing that he's at risk of getting exposed because of his work.

The price tag eclipses the first emergency coronavirus aid bill of roughly $8 billion approved earlier this month to address response efforts. Late Monday, the House sent a second bill to address paid sick leave and testing to the Senate.
Those gases can now be captured, cleaned up and used interchangeably with conventional natural gas, Heiting says, allowing them to flow through the pipeline system and providing a very similar climate benefit to wind and solar.

You could literally have a stack of executive orders on Donald Trump's desk in the Oval Office that he could sign literally in his first hours of being president, Moore said. And that would be in many cases, I think, an enormous lift to the economy.
In addition to doling out cash for re-enlistment, the Pentagon offered student loan repayments. The incentives were seen as crucial to the military's effort to keep its ranks flush, but auditors say the rules should have limited the largest payments to certain skill areas — and that in the rush to staff the war effort, the bonuses were given out too liberally, the L.A. Times reports.
One way that most employers responded at the very beginning is they offered flexibility. So for white-collar workers who could work from home, they said you can work at different hours. You can work in the early morning or late at night instead of being available for the midday meeting if you have child duties. Then for hourly and essential workers, they offered people to shift their schedules or to shift locations to a store near their house, things like that. And that was a helpful response last March.
We'd be more than happy to absolve these people of their debts, Maj. Gen. Matthew Beevers, deputy commander of the California National Guard, tells the Times. We just can't do it. We'd be breaking the law.

He has pledged that his first formal briefing and his highest priority will be bringing to justice the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, as well as the people who may have funded and organized that deadly attack in Washington as lawmakers met to certify the 2020 presidential election.
KING: So the Italian government has got some new numbers on infections and deaths. Is that right?
Currently, members of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee say they expect annual GDP growth rates of 2 percent in the long run. An extra half-point each year would still be far from Trump's goals.
Not when he pledges to rip up basic rules that hold corporations accountable...when he wants to scrap regulations that stop polluters from poisoning the air our children breathe and the water we drink... and let insurance companies write their own rules again.
Yes, especially being an avid skateboarder, the 26-year-old says. That's constantly something in the back of my head now — before I try this trick, what happens if I get hurt?
[There's a lot going on in this statistic. So here goes: Trump may be talking about the number of adults not in the labor force — that is, neither working nor looking for work (so it includes retirees and students, for example). That figure has climbed by 14 million since January 2009 (importantly, this isn't people leaving the labor force; it's just people not in it, period). But while labor force participation is relatively low, the labor force has still been growing — Trump's 14 million figure might imply that it's not. And that low labor force participation isn't entirely about a tough economy — a lot of it is simple demographics. In 2014, the Congressional Budget Office found that half of a recent 3-point drop in the rate had been due to baby boomers retiring. The other half was economic factors. — Danielle Kurtzleben]
MARTIN: So you use technology called Quantified Self. Talk a little bit about that. And how do you plan to use it so that people can make better financial decisions?
What Does The 'War' Over Obamacare Reveal About Our Governing Bodies?
Think about the natural gas distribution and storage system as a massive battery for wind and solar energy, Heiting says. Those are the kinds of tools we're going to need if we're truly going to achieve deep decarbonization economy-wide.
They don't sound good by any means, Goldstein, his former lawyer, said on Tuesday of the the comments on the recorded call.
On Fox Business this morning, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described direct payments as a kind of economic life preserver as the government tries to confront the pandemic.
More Republicans continued to speak out against Trump's travel ban, voicing concern over its implementation. Former President Barack Obama broke his silence since leaving office, saying through a spokesman that American values are at stake.
KING: Scott, we've reported a lot about the stock market slide, as you do. But one of the things it sounds like the president is trying to address is that there are people who are not so much worried about their investments - if indeed they have them - or their 401(k)s; they're worried about their paychecks. They're worried that they're going to be laid off.
SNELL: And we'll see the trial start on Tuesday.
Clinton's blood pressure was 100/70 during her physical, which is normal, along with a heart rate of 70, respiratory rate of 18, temperature of 97.8 and pulse oximetry of 99 percent.
Notably, it does not mention state and local aid, which was a key sticking point in past rounds of relief negotiations. Biden's package includes $350 billion in emergency funding for state and local governments.
So my message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages – including the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Trump And Technology Executives Try To Reconcile Rough Relationship
Rivian plans to make battery-powered trucks and SUVs in a former auto plant in central Illinois. It's the same plant where Wade Jensen's career began three decades ago, when Mitsubishi and Chrysler teamed up there to build cars.
And studies do suggest that closing the loopholes only helps wealthy renters. Overall, the research says rent laws tend to shrink the number of regulated apartments, as landlords convert units to condos, pay tenants to leave or don't build any new housing.
GINGRICH: No. It shows you the political risk of dealing with the American news media. There's a reason that various media analysts say Trump gets, like, 92 percent negative coverage. He knows whatever he does, three weeks later, virtually every major media outlet in the country will be against it.

These are only two examples, but they suggest that partisan messaging in Washington on some specific issues doesn't necessarily filter down to Americans.
GREENE: And that leads me to ask about how this is being characterized because you have President Trump saying in the United States that this deal is momentous. But as you say, a lot of these tariffs remain in place. I mean, I wonder how Chinese officials are characterizing it and what that might tell us.
PETE BUTTIGIEG: Let's put forward somebody who actually lives and works in a middle-class neighborhood in an industrial Midwestern city. Let's put forward somebody who's actually a Democrat.

FELBER: You know, all across the country right now, anchormen and anchorwomen are looking up the word lobotomy and going - hey.
In the Swift boat campaign, I immediately condemned the attacks on John Kerry's combat record. I said it was dishonest and dishonorable to question his performance for this nation in combat. Now, any time before or after his role in combat, then I think it's relatively fair game. But, no, I did not approve of the attacks on John Kerry's combat record because he served honorably in Vietnam just as President Bush, in my view, served honorably in the National Guard.
People Keep Talking About 'The Establishment.' What Is It, Anyway?
'Squishy' Rules On Who Can Snoop Where
MARTIN: So, where do you think the movement goes from here?
In his first interview as president, Trump doubled down (tripled down?) on his unproven belief that there were millions of illegal voters. You have people that are registered who are dead, who are illegals, who are in two states. You have people registered in two states. They're registered in a New York and a New Jersey. They vote twice. There are millions of votes, in my opinion, he told ABC's David Muir.
He says he's a businessman, and this is what businessmen do.
The United States needs to create more manufacturing jobs: That has been a constant refrain of President Trump and was one of the goals of the corporate tax cut recently passed by Congress and signed into law. The loss of manufacturing jobs has been a problem for many countries, especially the U.S. It played a big role in Trump's election.
GREENE: Is that a good thing for either side?
Airlines had initially wanted half of the $50 billion in aid to be in the form of direct cash grants. But the initial plan proposed by Senate Republicans would give airlines $50 billion, but all of it in loans that would have to be paid back.
The colossal package would bring a new round of payments to Americans still battling against the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, and it includes an increase to the child tax credit and an extension of supplemental unemployment benefits through Sept. 6.
Donald Trump got 8 percent of the African-American vote, according to exit polls. That's better than Mitt Romney's exit poll result in 2012 (6 percent) and John McCain's (4 percent) in 2008 (that said, these are differences of only a few points, so it may not be meaningful). But prior to McCain, 8 percent is no better than any Republican stretching back to 1972, at least, performed among African-American Republicans, according to exit poll data compiled by the New York Times.
EISBRENNER: ...I really think that if Putin was interested in interfering in Washington, then Ovechkin and the Capitals would have had a different outcome in Game 7 against the Penguins, you know. How well does he know Putin? I don't know. I didn't see any interference there.
John Weeda, director of the North Dakota Transmission Authority, says that he has been talking to several companies that are interested in buying the coal plant. Weeda, who previously worked for Great River Energy and supervised operations at Coal Creek Station, is optimistic that the plant will stay in operation. He says that the potential buyers would like to build an addition to the plant that would capture its carbon dioxide emissions. Previous attempts to deploy this technology, however, have not been profitable. NRG Energy, which currently operates the only facility in the U.S. that captures carbon dioxide emissions from a coal-burning power plant, recently announced that it will suspend operations at the plant.

SCHNEIDER: Twenty-two homicides equals $11 million. At the height of Juarez's narco violence, many Mexican shoppers flocked to the safety of El Paso. Now, it's El Paso that looks more dangerous.
What bothers Pilar Marrero, senior political reporter for La Opinion, about the word is that it's the only one like it. Politicians have been accused of pandering to the elderly, African-Americans, and farmers since the dawn of time, she argues, so why does it only get called out with special language when it comes to Hispanics? I think it's kind of ridiculous, says Marrero. I don't like these denigrating terms.
KELLY: In just a few seconds, cynics might wonder whether part of getting health care back on the table is that the president's 100-day mark is coming up. Is this - is this, in some way, a push to get a big, visible win out on the table in advance of that?
But critics questioned how well it worked for the White House.
MONTANARO: Well, and that this costs trillions and trillions of dollars. I mean, the fact is that people want to know how much their energy bill is going to be each month.

This story is part of a series of conversations on Morning Edition with politicians, writers, scientists, theologians, tech innovators and others. From globalization to religious tolerance, identity to climate change, our conversations seek to capture this moment and how we're shaped by it — as individuals, nations and as a global civilization.
As we strolled the halls of the Capitol, down elevators and through the underground tunnel that leads to the House office buildings, Pallone reflected on why his Republican colleagues were keeping the legislation under lock and key.
KELLY: What about the criminal justice side of this? What is Virginia doing for people who have been punished for having a drug that is about to be legal, it sounds like, Whittney?
Clinton's diagnosis came to light on Sunday after she became overheated and dehydrated at a Sept. 11 memorial service in New York City. She began to feel dizzy and nearly collapsed while getting into a Secret Service van, which took her to her daughter Chelsea's apartment to rest. The Clinton campaign official said Bardack has since examined her several times, including on Wednesday, and the physician said Clinton continues to improve.
But Roth is more than just Trump's adviser. Over the years, his company has served as Trump's business partner.
The administration says it wants the question to better protect racial minorities' voting rights.
After a video that detailed his tenure in the White House — his speeches during mass shootings, his handling of the Great Recession, his Supreme Court nominations, passage of the Affordable Care Act, and a Supreme Court decision making same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states — Obama took the stage.
It's not ancient history. If he's elected president, it's our future and the future of hardworking people across America.
Congressional Republicans released a final draft of their tax bill Friday. With newfound support from two wavering senators, lawmakers appear to be on track to pass the measure and deliver it to President Trump for his signature by Christmas.
We are the greatest country on Earth and we are headed and were headed in the right direction.
ELVING: President Carter, on his first full day in office in 1977, issued a blanket pardon to all Vietnam War resisters, a promise he had made during his campaign. President George H.W. Bush...
The Biden administration will start the transition process for Senate-confirmed U.S. attorneys as early as Tuesday, but expects to keep in place two prosecutors leading high-profile, politically sensitive investigations, a senior Justice Department official tells NPR.
The ruling against congressional Democrats' prized push to boost the federal minimum wage is not the first time MacDonough has been in the spotlight.
KHALID: This was Clinton's first trip to Ohio since Labor Day. The demographics here seem to tilt against her. It's a state with a large white working-class population. Still, she told voters she needs their help.
Others, like Anna Novak, who's married to a miner, urged the county to keep up the fight to save coal power. People are scared that they're going to lose their jobs, and that Hazen and Beulah will become ghost towns, she said. She pointed out that many of the landowners who support the wind projects and would profit from them don't even live nearby.
Tax filers have little longer to get their paperwork in to the Internal Revenue Service.
We created Space Force, We, we, we. Look at what we did. Our military has been totally rebuilt. So we create Space Force which, by and of itself, is a major achievement for an administration. And with us it's one of so many different things.
MARTIN: So remember that after Obama was elected, McConnell famously said that his No. 1 goal was depriving Obama of a second term. He did not succeed in that. But he did succeed in kind of throwing so much sand in the gears that Democrats had a really hard time accomplishing many of their goals. They did accomplish some, the Affordable Care Act being sort of chief among them, I think, one might argue. What's his goal now?
MANN: More broadly, Rachel, you know, calling out the National Guard is the kind of thing that could contribute to volatility on Wall Street. New York state as a whole relies on Wall Street for tax revenue. Governor Cuomo says he's asking state officials to reevaluate how this epidemic could affect a state budget that already had a $6 billion deficit even before coronavirus hit.
MARTIN: Many Americans have been laid off or have at least seen a drop in income in recent weeks and are probably worried they won't be able to make rent this month. What should they do?
KING: Diane, in the seconds we have left, I want to ask you, do you think the White House is handling the response well when it comes to the economy?
MARTIN: Right. So let's talk about Bernie Sanders. I mean, he did not speak last night.
The Florida program, created by the Legislature in 2001, has been popular. In the 2015-2016 school year, 92,000 students received scholarships, a 17 percent increase from the year before. The state's scholarship organization, Step Up for Students, announced that the recipients were overwhelmingly African-American and Hispanic, with incomes just above the poverty line. Over 70 percent of the scholarships are directed at religious, primarily Christian, schools.
The new mayor promised to tackle violence and education, but cautioned that the city's problems will not be solved overnight.
They eliminate any colorable doubt about the link between Hofeller and government employees involved in the citizenship question approval process, write plaintiffs' attorneys with the law firm Covington & Burling, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and Asian Americans Advancing Justice — AAJC.
This one we can take piece by piece. For starters, the workforce is growing (in raw numbers). Presumably, Trump is referring to the labor force participation rate, which he also referenced sometimes on the campaign trail. That is smaller than it used to be, though it has leveled off recently ... and either way, the falling rate is not entirely a bad thing.
AMY KLOBUCHAR: So true. So true.
MARGARET HOOVER: We're screwed either way, guys. Let's be very clear about what the reality is. We are not going to win this election either way. But in one - and this is the calculation that Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina made - he hates, despises, abhors, disrespects, cannot really buy Ted Cruz at all. But he believes that at the end of the day, we lose 40 states, we still have a Republican Party that we can rebuild. And if you go with Donald Trump, it's destroyed.
We have been hearing a lot about how hard the coronavirus is on health workers. This morning I'm talking to two doctors in Atlanta. They are married to each other, and they have three little kids. They live in the same house, and they're both at home. But they haven't been in the same room for almost two weeks. That's because they are among the people across the country who are responding to the coronavirus pandemic.
Inclusion of the ethics measure threatened to bring down the entire rules package — the governing rules of the chamber — that is headed for a vote later Tuesday. The majority party traditionally passes the rules package on its votes alone, and a defeat would have been an embarrassing start for Republicans in the new Congress.
It encourages states to encourage silver loading only on the exchange, says Aviva Aron-Dine, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Oh, which you're pointing out because African Americans have a higher rate of poverty. Is that why that is?
Next week, the plaintiffs' attorneys head to the U.S. district court in Maryland to argue for Judge Hazel to reconsider an allegation that the Trump administration intended to discriminate against immigrant communities of color by adding the question, Is this person a citizen of the United States? Hazel is also considering a request to review new evidence that plaintiffs say shows that administration officials conspired to violate those communities' constitutional rights.
You know, I'll have an opportunity coming up on Saturday to speak at an event in Greenville, South Carolina, where Tom Tancredo will also be. And you can rest assured that part of my speech will address his comment of having literacy tests needed to allow people to vote. I obviously stand against that. I think it's akin to the 21st century version of grandfather clauses and poll taxes.
Cenk Uygur, the leftist host of the Young Turks and a supporter of Bernie Sanders, predicted in July that Trump would beat Clinton based on a populist appeal tapping into voter anger against the establishment. He looks pretty good in retrospect. But he has for years been considered outside the acceptable norm of media voices.
Landell says his workers tell him that with those benefits, they're not as tempted to illegally cross the border: If they can make a decent living and put food on the table of their child [by] working in Mexico, they will stay in Mexico.
The findings of a new study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine show that the largest players in the soda industry, the Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo, spent millions of dollars between 2011 and 2015 lobbying against 29 different public health bills that aimed to either improve nutrition or reduce soda consumption.
MONTANARO: Well, look, when we look at these tax returns, we're looking at three things to start off with - one, income, two, tax rate - what they pay in taxes - and three, their charitable giving. So just a few top lines from this so far. Kamala Harris' household was the highest income, and they were taxed at the highest rate. Beto O'Rourke and his wife have significant assets and investments and, according to his 2017 tax return, didn't give a whole lot to charity. And Elizabeth Warren, she was the most charitable. But a notable finding from these tax returns was what it showed about Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent senator. For years and years he's been one of the least wealthy members of Congress. But since his 2016 campaign, he was able to cash in on a book that he wrote, Here We Go From Here (ph). And he has lambasted millionaires and billionaires, as we know, for years - but guess what? After 2016, he made over a million dollars in some of those years. And that was something he was asked about during a town hall on Fox News last night. Let's take a listen...
The researchers then monitored the workers' on-the-job performance, comparing them to a group of workers that didn't get paid upfront. The researchers find that the workers who were paid upfront were significantly more productive, making 6.2% more plates per hour. The biggest effect was seen with the poorest workers. Even more, the plates they made were less likely to be marred by mistakes, indicating they were more attentive on the job.

In 2014, Russian intelligence leaked a recording of a phone call between two American diplomats that appeared to depict the United States stage-managing events in Ukraine from behind the scenes — and which sought to drive a wedge between Washington and the European Union.
During Manafort's Virginia trial, the president spoke warmly of him. He called Manafort a good man and said he had been unfairly targeted by the Justice Department — sparking questions about whether Trump might pardon him.

Take Andrew Weissmann, a special counsel lawyer who once led the Justice Department's Enron Task Force. Prosecutors looking to uncover and punish fraud at that defunct energy company famously threatened to charge the wife of the company's chief financial officer with tax offenses if he did not agree to plead guilty and testify against his corporate superiors. The finance official, Andrew Fastow, refused. So, authorities indicted his wife, Lea. They both served prison time.
But we've done it quickly and we were going to sit home and watch a big victory and everybody had us down for a victory. It was going to be great and now we're out here fighting. I said to somebody, I was going to take a few days and relax after our big electoral victory. 10 o'clock it was over. But I was going to take a few days.
The tech giant points to people like Monique Wilsondebriano. She launched the Charleston Gourmet Burger company in South Carolina. When she first started, she could not afford TV or radio ads. But she was able to drum up interest on Facebook.
LISA SAUNDERS: No, but maybe it will spur Congress to force something to be done about his taxes.
Starting even before the election, we will bring together leaders from across our economy and our communities for meetings on jobs,American competitiveness, and working families. We all need to pull together and give our country the best chance to succeed.
HORSLEY: That's right. VA Secretary David Shulkin was booted just this past week. He had been the target of a scathing inspector general's report for taking his wife along on a trip to Europe at taxpayers' expense. Now, Shulkin and some others argue that was just a pretext and that he was really fired over policy differences, concerning privatization of veterans health care.
It's Been Another Decade Of Income Inequality In The U.S.
Chelsea Powell from New Jersey plans to pay off a collections account on her credit report, and replace her 9-year-old laptop with something a bit more modern. She's still employed full time, but when the pandemic hit and hurt restaurants and bars, she lost her second job as a bartender.
KING: OK. So tonight is going to be a big night for Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. Right?
BUTLER: So the Justice Department has the responsibility of enforcing the law, including enforcing civil rights laws. And if people who are charged with enforcing settled law are unwilling to say whether they respect that law, that's a real concern.
We believe in an America where small businesses are respected, not scammed. I have a plan to make sure big businesses can't stiff suppliers and contractors like Donald's been doing for years.
The bill repeals the alternative minimum tax for corporations and raises the income threshold at which individuals would face the AMT.
Copyright law is just a mess, she says. A lot of copyright lawyers wouldn't have a job if it wasn't a mess.
Ideally, says Kupferschmid, Rose's mom would just have to pay the $500 or whatever extra amount the photographer charges to post the wedding pics on Facebook. And he adds, the CASE Act also limits how many claims people can file and includes guardrails against copyright trolls — people who use frivolous lawsuits to make money.
LIASSON: Look; there is a big split in the party between the left - Bernie Sanders - and the center-left Democrats. And what's so interesting to me about the debate is that last night, the center-left candidates - Biden, Klobuchar, Buttigieg, Bloomberg, to a certain extent Warren - formed a circular firing squad. They clearly do not think it is time yet to coalesce around one single alternative to Bernie Sanders. And as long as they don't think it's time to do that, Sanders has a pretty unimpeded path to the nomination.
The changes are part of a sweeping plan to wean the kingdom off its dependency on oil revenues and put hundreds of thousands of unemployed Saudis to work in the private sector. But while some economists welcome the reforms, business owners interviewed by NPR during a recent visit to Saudi Arabia say the changes are challenging to implement.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Nick, I hear you are graduating from the University of Michigan this weekend.
If Democrats were only proposing a child allowance, Tim Smeeding says, it could lead to fewer workers. But because they're also proposing other work incentives, including more child care subsidies, the net effect will be to increase work amongst the lower-income recipients.
The top Senate Republican also committed to the Senate remaining in session to pass broader relief.

Briton Tom Pullen is one of Station F's 3,000 entrepreneurs. He says Paris is booming these days.
But the types of deductions favored by the ultrawealthy, such as tax shelters, don't get counted, Burman says. Income from capital gains also gets preferential treatment under the AMT.
However, the Podesta emails leaked the same day as a lewd tape of Trump claiming he could grope women because of his fame. As the backlash against Trump intensifies and more Republican leaders call for his resignation, Clinton's Wall Street speeches may not pack as strong a punch as Priebus had hoped.
In retrospect, there are multiple ways to interpret this question.
Some of the biggest recipients would include:
Christa was my liaison over there to ensure that we could get a timely response from Census, Commerce Department official Sahra Park-Su testified during a deposition for the lawsuits. If she responded, then that was good as — as what Census was going forward with.
TANKERSLEY: Well, there's a lot. It's a big, sweeping change. This is not a simple tax cut like we saw in the previous decade. So on the one hand, it collapses the number of brackets on the income tax side. And so most people would see lower tax rates on their income. Exception there is millionaires. But most everyone would see lower tax rates.
When I realized that my faith wasn't necessarily about the [Christian Reformed] Church, and it wasn't even necessarily about the Bible but about my relationship with God and that God is all-encompassing and loving, I felt very free, Koster says.
Then there are what Harvard Business School professor and co-author of The Prosperity Paradox Clayton Christensen calls market-creating innovations. Christensen says that a lot of money right now is being poured into making good products or services cheaper through strategies like outsourcing, for example. But outsourcing can actually worsen inequality if there aren't new jobs for the laid-off workers.
The crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight, Biden said during a televised address, six days before taking office. There's no time to waste. We have to act and we have to act now.
GONYEA: That's a sentiment you heard more often from Sanders supporters in 2016. This time, you hear fewer claims that the nominating process is rigged against Sanders and more who sound like Alice Symmes.
Still, the National Organization for Rare Disorders, a patient advocacy group, said remdesivir's designation follows the letter of the law.
President Biden invited a group of Senate Republicans to the White House to talk COVID relief today.
State insurance commissioners have warned that abrupt cancellation of cost-sharing subsidies would cause premiums, copays and deductibles to increase and more insurance companies to leave the markets in 2018, Alexander said in a statement on Aug. 16. Congress now should pass balanced, bipartisan, limited legislation in September that will fund cost-sharing payments for 2018.
Without knowing exactly why, there isn't enough evidence to justify raising the minimum wage, says Aparna Mathur, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
Biden said he was also disappointed but respected the parliamentarian's decision.
KING: Yeah. So if this has been going on since November, why today? It's February 1. Why did it take them months?
Have you searched for hand sanitizer at pharmacies, grocery stores, gas stations, but they're out? What about a distillery? This week, the Tax and Trade Bureau gave alcohol beverage producers a special exemption to make hand sanitizer. NPR's Samantha Balaban reports from a distillery in the District of Columbia that's doing just that.
MARTIN: Well, to your point, we had a conversation earlier this week with Rep. Reid Ribble. He's a Republican from Wisconsin. He considers himself a conservative, but he's also a member of the No Labels group, which is trying to work toward bipartisan solutions to big political issues. And we asked him about whether immigration reform is going to get through the House anytime soon, if it's even going to be taken up. And this is what he had to say.
GRANHOLM: You know, every governor is doing this, Ari. It is an amazing thing to see on a federal level - the president doing this. Democrats and Republicans are pursuing job providers constantly and trying to lure them or keep them in their states through the only tool they have really, which is state tax credits.
First of all, says Lynch, wherever you choose to work, you need to be treated with dignity.
Manafort declined to offer any of his own witnesses in his defense, which is his constitutional right.
Environmental groups, like the Natural Resources Defense Council, want to see more in the bills to shift the state toward a cleaner energy economy.
Four witnesses have testified under penalty of perjury that after officials in Detroit announced the last votes had been counted, tens of thousands of additional ballots arrived without required envelopes. Every single one was for a Democrat. I got no votes.
There are far more families than you would think — given an unemployment rate that's at a 50-year low — that have tremendous difficulties making ends meet on what they earn, he said. These arguments about the gap between earnings and needs, I think, provide a real opening for Democrats.
There has been no information whatsoever coming out of the federal government to say, you know, we're thinking of a moratorium, Bousman says.
Lastly, Biden advisers have characterized his proposal as a combination of rescue measures to combat the immediate pain of the recession and recovery initiatives designed to address longer-term economic challenges.
The provision exists only in the House tax bill, not the Senate version. Many graduate students are hoping that the proposal doesn't end up seeing the light of day.
The government has paid $400 of that amount for each patient, he says, but no longer does, due to the economic crisis. The rest of the the center's budget comes from private donors, he says, but we cannot rely on donors in this period.
But even though NLMK is creating American jobs, the company is being hit with a 25 percent tariff on steel because it imports raw steel slabs from Russia before turning them into coils in Pennsylvania and then selling that steel to customers that manufacture cars or pipes, for example.

Trump addresses a very divided nation
I also spoke with Congresswoman Karen Bass. She is a Democrat from California. And she also has a deep background as a lawmaker, having served as a former speaker of the California Assembly. She's also an officer of the Congressional Black Caucus. When we spoke, I began by asking her to reflect on then-candidate Trump's attempt to appeal to African-American voters when he famously said, what do you have to lose?
As the tax deadline nears and the demand for IRS tax help by phone is higher, the IRS encourages taxpayers to make IRS.gov their first stop when questions arise, the agency wrote.
We're not going to build a giant wall, Clinton said. We're going to build roads and bridges and tunnels and ports and airports and water systems and a new electric grid.
JUAN ESCALANTE: I don't have a safety net.
So let's head now into the Barbershop to talk more about all this. Now, of course, this is where we sit down with a group of interesting folks to talk about what's in the news and what's on their minds. A special politics-focused Barbershop today because, you know, why - what else would we talk about today but politics? It's President Trump's first anniversary in office, the first government shutdown in five years, the first when both - when one party controlled all three branches of government.
Three cities followed suit with similar measures. But the beverage industry has been fighting back.
The president, in his Battle Creek visit, referred to Whitmer's at-home political troubles as she continues to fight with Republicans.
SNELL: Yeah, $350 billion in forgivable loans. So if a business takes out a loan and then uses it on payroll, or rent, or mortgage or past debts that they need to pay to stay afloat, that could be forgiven. And the tax credits are also available to keep people on payroll even if they're not working, so up to $10,000 per employee this year.
For example, our modern service economy is empowering consumers with more choices and greater flexibility. But we need to do more to empower the workers in our service sector too. The people taking care of our children and our parents they deserve a good wage, good benefits, and a secure retirement.
GROSS: I just heard a hum in the background. Is that a plane going by?
[Last year, just over 11 percent of America's workforce was unionized. That's down from about 20 percent in 1983. Economists cite workers' declining bargaining power as one factor in sluggish wage growth. — Scott Horsley]

That could, Fensholt said, leave company plans with the same adverse selection problem experienced by many individual plans now sold via Obamacare's online marketplaces — too high a percentage of members who are older, sicker and more expensive.
That message is the silver lining for Africans in the Panama Papers scandal — a collection of documents linking 143 politicians (and their family members and cronies) to outrageous sums of stolen cash hidden in a topsy-turvy network of offshore bank accounts and shell companies.
If he can do it through tax incentives where companies are building plants in the U.S. because they get a good tax deal, then he won't have to do it company by company, which I think is very unrealistic, he told Morning Edition this week.
Rep. Matt Gaetz said on Monday that he was self-quarantining after learning he had been in contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus at a conservative conference last month. Before making the announcement, Gaetz had flown on Air Force One with Trump.
The FDA told NPR that this is why remdesivir was given orphan status this week, adding that it met the standard criteria for prevalence for designation.
Veterans Affairs and NASA were the biggest winners, while the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers saw big declines. The largest declines were seen at the Commerce Department — that's because the 2020 census will have concluded, accounting for the drawdown in spending.
CORNISH: Now, another issue that the Trump campaign has jumped on - Clinton opened herself up for more criticism over her private email system. She said heading into the weekend that she short-circuited during her recent interview when she falsely claimed the director of the FBI said her public statements on her email were truthful and the FBI director was actually talking about her statements to federal investigators. But how is the Clinton campaign responding to this issue that honestly is not going away?
Incomes aren't growing fast enough to keep up with costs like prescription drugs and child care.
KELLY: How confident are you that whatever tax plan you arrive at, that it will stick? I'm going to quote for you - The Washington Post recently began an article with the line Trump has had more tax plans than wives.
EVAN OSNOS: I assumed that, like, I think like a lot of Americans, that campaign promises are not very valuable in terms of actually predicting the course of a presidency. We - you know, we tend to remember when campaigns say things that they don't then fulfill. But actually, the political science on this is pretty clear, and it tells a very different story, which is that if you go back over the history of the presidency, you find that presidents tend to achieve the majority - the overwhelming majority of the things that they set out to accomplish when they were candidates.
Just as vexing are the cultural questions, especially among the staff and faculty who work with LGBT students on a daily basis. All colleges and universities receiving federal aid are required to have a Title IX coordinator responsible for working with students who feel they have been subject to discrimination because of their sex. Whether gay or transgender students are entitled to Title IX protection is unresolved, so Title IX coordinators find themselves having to judge on their own how to respond to those students who seek their help.
I honestly don't know if I would have taken the job if it weren't for that specific guarantee, because I knew I wanted to work on the general election, Jeweler said.

In Bangladesh and India, we're more independent. We've had an office in Bangladesh a long time, we have roots there.
I think Sen. Corker is one of the brightest guys in the entire conference. I think he is sincere in his concerns. I'd much rather have him expressing that now than in the last few days before a vote, said Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., He adds value, and he will make our product better.
PROOPS: Is that the full Scarface, that one?
President Biden has been signing executive orders to reverse Trump administration policies, but some parts of Trump's legacy won't be easy to reverse. For example, research into food and farming took a major hit during the Trump years. Here's Frank Morris of member station KCUR.
LIASSON: It could be different because Donald Trump has deep, longstanding beliefs here. He has believed for 30 or more years that trade deficits and surpluses are measures of strength. He sees them like a score card or a balance sheet, not indications of comparative advantage. And unlike gun control or immigration laws, he doesn't need Congress for this one. When he talks about making legislative deals with Democrats on guns or immigration, the GOP leadership in Congress can just ignore him. On this one, they can't because presidents have unilateral power to raise tariffs.
KURTZLEBEN: Right, and one thing you might be seeing on the Republican side, on the flipside, is this sort of rallying effect around the party nominee. Donald Trump has secured his party's nomination much more quickly than anyone on the Democrat side is. Clinton still looks like the likely nominee over there, but she still hasn't wrapped it up yet. So that may be boosting Trump's figures right now.
GROSS: So this is a pretty broad question, but why did Republicans make health care coverage, government health care coverage such a big target? I mean, everybody wants health care. Of course, some people prefer to do it through private insurance, through employer insurance. But what were some of the motivations behind such strong Republican opposition? And, you know, how much of it do you think was ideological - you know, a belief that government should not be funding this? How much of it do you think was, like, you know, budget hawks saying, we just can't afford to spend this; it's a bad idea; we're going to go into debt? And how much of it was money, like lobbyists who, you know, support Republicans who didn't want the ACA to pass and threatened to withdraw their funding?
What do you mean you don't care? Stahl asked.
GRAVES: A couple years back in Milwaukee, there was a lot of activity around sick leave measures. There was actually a referendum in which 70 percent or more of the people voted to ensure that employers within the city of Milwaukee were providing workers with paid sick. And after that measure passed, the state Legislature that came in with Governor Walker - Scott Walker here in Wisconsin - passed a preemption measure to thwart that bill, basically to make it impossible to enforce and prevent the local community in Milwaukee or other cities around the state from adopting similar measures.
With all that's at stake, he says, we need to shift our cultural attitudes. It's not the childless who must justify their lifestyle. It's the rest of us.
But I do believe, and I think what the evidence suggests, is that more and more people know my record on criminal justice, on economics. In the African-American community, in the Latino community, we are doing better and better and better.
Our trade deficit has reached an all-time high think of this, think of this, our trade deficit is nearly $800 billion, think of that, 800 billion dollars, last year alone. We're going to fix that.
GREENE: This, as we mentioned, is a national conversation right now. It seems like Congress has been focusing a lot on the issue of harassment this week. There was a hearing. There are bipartisan talks about overhauling congressional rules and their sexual harassment policy. Could lawmakers, in theory, take a leading role here and help guide the country through this moment?
Clinton also spoke to Wall Street repeatedly about the financial crisis and how to avoid it in the future. In an October 2013, speech at the Goldman Sachs AIMS Alternative Investments Symposium, Clinton said that blaming the banking system for the financial crisis was an oversimplification.
WEAVER: Yes, but wages have not gone up. And wealth...
More than 2,500 ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match incarcerated felons in Georgia prison. People who are not allowed to vote.
MARTIN: And nursing homes. And also of - from all these people who have lost their jobs. Are you thinking about whether we will get to the moment when all these precautions, necessary now - but whether we will get to a place where they are no longer worth the social and economic costs?
SIEGEL: Yeah. How exactly would this work? Would - I mean if Americans bought goods that had been taxed at the border coming in from Mexico, then American consumers would be paying more for the things that they're buying here.
How does that work? As the Tax Policy Center's Roberton Williams explained to NPR, the share of income going to the rich has climbed in a big way over the last few decades.
I said: No, I can't do that, it's unfair to him and it's unfair to the family. He didn't do anything wrong. They made up stories, they're all made-up stories. He didn't do anything wrong. Cut him loose, sir. I said, No, I won't do that. We got him through. And you know what, they couldn't give a damn. They couldn't give a damn. Let him rule the right way.
Trump said earlier Tuesday his administration was working with the cruise and airline industries that have been battered by the coronavirus outbreak as he traveled to Capitol Hill.
Most of GameStop stock gyrations have to do with a tug of war between amateur day traders on Reddit, one of the world's largest online communities — who are betting on the stock to keep rising — and the professional managers of Wall Street hedge funds, who have bet that GameStop's stock will crater.
GROSS: Now, since we've been talking a little bit about, you know, your experience as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and how that applies to your thoughts about torture, there's another Vietnam question I'd like to ask you. The National Security Agency recently released hundreds of pages of formerly secret documents on the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident.

Trump's grip on the Republican Party raises questions about the direction of the future of the GOP in a volatile and unpredictable period in American politics, with sky-high polarization and personal distrust.
For NPR News, I'm Rick Pluta.
After a tense day on the Senate floor that included leaders trading barbs over who is to blame for failing to advance a new coronavirus response bill, the top Senate Democrat said late Monday night that he was very, very close to an agreement with the White House on a deal for a third wave of emergency funding that could go well past $1 trillion.
Still, Rieder wonders: Is it really so crazy? Scientists have proposed incredibly risky schemes to geoengineer the clouds and oceans. They're researching ways to suck carbon out of the air on a mass scale. Some have even called for overhauling the global system of free-market capitalism.
The outgoing president incited violence in an attempt to retain power, and any elected leader defending him is violating their oath to the Constitution and rejecting democracy in favor of anarchy, said National Association of Manufacturers CEO Jay Timmons, urging Vice President Pence to consider invoking the 25th Amendment, which allows removal of a president deemed unfit to serve.

Given the emerging body of evidence that suggests the cognitive load of poverty hurts low-income folks' ability to escape their circumstances, the authors argue that policymakers should consider reshaping welfare programs with these psychological issues in mind. Giving poor people cash without conditions, for example, could do a lot to help them earn more cash on their own.
The official said the speech will be forward-looking and optimistic, much in the vein of Trump's first address to Congress in February 2017, shortly after he was inaugurated, when he called for the renewal of the American spirit.

Since the 1980s, income inequality has been on the rise, says Lucas Chancel, co-director of the World Inequality Lab at the Paris School of Economics. In the U.S., for example, Chancel says the richest 1% owned about 40% of the nation's wealth in 2016 — up from 20% in the 1980s — and Trump's 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality, with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of American households.
ORDOÑEZ: I mean, the big thing that was left out in that speech was the Capitol riots that were earlier this month and particularly his own role in inciting his supporters who went and stormed the Capitol. You know - and some of the language, when he says - when I think - hear him talk about leaving it all on the field, I can't help but think about some of the language that he used on January 6 that morning about needing, you know, needing to be strong and can't be weak. You need to take over. You know, we're not going to make change by being weak. I mean, those are the kind of things that really are going to impact his legacy.
Senate Health Care Bill Revisions Released In Attempt To Appease GOP Critics
I do think that when there's a wide spectrum of debate on an issue, that is where the public plays a role. That is where the public needs to call their member of Congress and say, 'This is something that I care about,'  she told NPR, adding, Where I do have trust is in my colleagues' capacity to change and evolve and be adaptable and listen to their constituents.
Keeping some Obamacare taxes. The first BCRA version would have repealed an array of Affordable Care Act taxes, which would have overwhelmingly benefited higher-income Americans. This newer version of the bill keeps some in place, including the net investment income tax and a payroll tax that hit higher-income Americans.
Let's recall that in his final days, the previous Congress approved a COVID relief measure, but that money is running out fast. President Biden promised to do more right away. He wants $1.9 trillion for individuals, businesses and schools. Now a group of Republican senators have sent him their counteroffer. To be precise, 10 Republicans made that offer - exactly the number Democrats would need to overcome a filibuster. But the Republicans want to spend much less. And Democrats do have a way to get their own measure through the Senate without Republicans if they choose.
KING: So very substantial relief, President Trump says. What is he talking about?
MARTIN: OK. So I see both of you have fully absorbed the national party talking points, so there we go. So let's take a step back now and ask each of you to assess this year of Donald Trump's presidency. What effect do you think it's had on the country? Kathleen, I'll go to you first.
Thank you very much. Take care.
We are concerned, Landell says. Right now we're not making any investment plans or any expansion plans, because you don't know what will happen next year. Everything is on hold.
Now, holding the attorney general in contempt is a really big and really public way to say that Democrats really aren't going to back down, even if, say, the president decides he doesn't want to comply with any of the requests that they have on any of the investigative fronts. You know, we're not just talking about the Russia investigation here. They're also looking into his - the president's business dealings and even his tax returns.

Here's a look at some of the changes that individual filers could expect if either the House or Senate versions is included in the final bill.
Research on the effects of Canada's program shows that parents and caregivers use the money to cover rent, groceries, transportation, education and computer costs. Interestingly, one study found large and significant decreases in both alcohol and tobacco spending among families, perhaps because the benefit eased parents' stress.
Of course, Latinos aren't a monolith, and not all Latinos feel the same way about Hispandering or the types of political gestures that tend to trigger the label. As Cepeda wrote in her 2012 piece about the term:

But I think the reality is it's - what we're seeing is even if it's not called a health pandemic, which is a bit semantics at this point in time, it's what I call an economic pandemic because it has spread globally. And it is affecting the global economy. And the U.S. is not an island unto itself. It is not immune to these effects. We've seen the cancellation in flights. We've seen the airlines get particularly hard hit and the reaction effect that's actually coming into the U.S. as well.
The IRS says it's still reviewing the just-passed bill. A spokesman told NPR the measure is a really heavy lift in some respects.

It's also possible that the U.S. is now in a sort of post-economic election era. That's what political analyst Charlie Cook said at a Washington economic conference this week.
House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is moving close to victory. After a frustrating year in which Republicans who control Congress failed to repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act, Congress is moving closer to approving its first major legislation of 2017.
So by getting people to change just five of 100 trips, the researchers saw the neighborhoods in their experiments become more economically balanced. As they concluded in the paper:
We've been working with the administration on a daily basis to map out and plan a very bold and aggressive agenda to make good on our campaign promises and to fix these problems, House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters gathered here for the party's annual three-day GOP policy retreat. Pence and President Trump joined the lawmakers here on Thursday.
Ultimately, she says, parts are parts, and people are people.
As a result, the Tax Policy Center predicts that in 2027, the average tax cut would amount to $160, or just a 0.2 percent income bump.
I don't think we can take the risk of excluding anybody from this effort, of saying that if you're not either for a revolution or a status quo, then you don't fit. I think we're going to defeat this president by inviting everybody to be at our side and get this done together, Buttigieg said.

Mulvaney first entered national politics in 2010, unseating a long-serving Democratic congressman in a wave of Republican victories that year. He cast himself as a plain spoken Tea Party firebrand, and pushed to constrain government spending from his perch in Congress.
He repeated his claim that the U.S. has spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, calling the situation a hornet's nest. (PolitiFact has looked at this figure and found that it includes projected spending, beyond money that has already been spent.)
Some conservative Christian groups will welcome the promise, but many Americans may wonder what Trump was talking about. Here are five basic questions that we can answer.

A Silver Lining In The Panama Papers
INSKEEP: But now, I have to say, first, congratulations on getting that number right. But, of course, as things like the Trump administration's tax cut extend, it gets more and more unpredictable over time. The Trump administration, for example, forecast that the tax cut would pay for itself, which seemed false at the time and turned out to be false. Should people take your economic estimate here as realistic and make plans based on it?
JOHNSON: We started to hear from Philip Ayliff, who was Manafort's accountant. Prosecutors used Ayliff to point out Manafort had not disclosed any foreign bank accounts on his tax returns.

SANDERS: Well, for a start, when you have in Flint, Mich., a water system which is poisoning children and, to a lesser degree, we have collapsing water systems in many communities in this country, yes, we need to invest heavily in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. We have a plan for a trillion-dollar investment that would create up to 13 million decent-paying jobs. Second of all, you are quite right in saying that we did well in Michigan yesterday because of our trade position. NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations with China have cost us millions of decent-paying jobs. As president, I intend to change those policies and demand that corporate America start investing in this country, not just in Mexico, China and other low-wage countries. In terms of other economic policies to create jobs, we will be supporting medium-sized businesses and small businesses, providing tax incentives to them.

ELVING: Legal scholars agree on at least a few limits to the pardon power. One is that the president cannot pardon people for crimes not yet committed. Another is that a president cannot pardon himself because he cannot act as judge on his own case. But on Twitter, Trump has said that, quote, all agree the president has complete power to pardon, unquote. It's unclear what he means by complete. But when asked about using that pardon for others, such as his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort who's been indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller, the president is noncommittal.
But, she added, They are not the cause of the rot. They are just the biggest, stinkiest example of it.

That room was just down the hall from House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's office, so Pallone went in to ask McCarthy where he could see the legislation. McCarthy directed him to Walden's office.
This is the beginning of this plan to make sure it's done right, Spicer told reporters traveling aboard Air Force One. It clearly provides the funding and it does so in a way that ensures that the American taxpayer is wholly respected.
Jeff Sedlik is less concerned. As well as being a photographer, he's the CEO of the Plus Coalition, a group working to make it easier to figure out who owns the copyrights to images. He agreed to spell out the process of filing a claim through the CASE Act.
GREEN: Well, it might do a lot of things. So what wallet.AI would do is, even before we got to the mall, it would be conversing with you on a fairly regular basis about what the state of your finances were. Telling you, in effect, whether or not you were in a position where you could easily afford to buy those shoes or whether you might have to make some sacrifices to afford those shoes, or whether or not you just shouldn't care and should just go out and really enjoy yourself and buy those shoes. And then when you're in that moment...

There could be much more movement from employer coverage to individual plans, especially among younger and healthier workers, Levitt said.
There's also the question, you know, which I'm not sure how you'd answer. You know, his assets, his hotels, his golf courses - they're all just inextricably linked to his brand name. And so what value are they going to have on the open market if he's not involved with the company?
Companies like Wal-Mart say tax cuts are making it possible for them to boost wages. But other economic factors could also be contributing to pay increases.
But even accepting that point, and respecting every new addition to Twitter's list of tools, we find a way to keep arguing. Even the candidates do it.
Trump could potentially get more factories to stay, says Carlos Gutierrez, secretary of commerce under George W. Bush.

The $4.875 trillion budget highlighted Trump's priorities on border security, tax cuts, space exploration and other policies he may pursue if he wins a second term in the November presidential election.
And not everyone can or will have those middle- and high-skill jobs; those low-skill jobs are set to just keep growing. That could mean putting in place better supports for people at the bottom of the income spectrum: a higher minimum wage, an expanded earned income tax credit, and paid leave are all examples Holzer gives. Trump has proposed a paid leave plan, but that can't start until he's taken office and gets legislation through Congress. And that process will take much, much longer longer than convincing a single company to keep a single factory in the U.S.

He says he's been so consumed by the day-to-day, he's had little chance to focus on the long term — despite that he came to prominence as a man who was trying to think long term. In 2016, while working at an investment firm, Anton anonymously published essays that sought to make sense of the Trump phenomenon. The most famous was The Flight 93 Election. Anton compared Trump voters to passengers on the plane hijacked on Sept. 11, 2001, who were choosing to rush the cockpit. They might still die but it was their only hope.

In September of last year, Donald Trump released his first tax plan, but now he has made another go of it. Over the past couple of months, he has released an overhaul that changes rates and includes newly announced child care deductions. The revised plan would still cost the government trillions in revenues, according to a new analysis, though not as much as his last plan.
We got Donald Trump in that presidency. We can't keep having that foolishness. I vote because I don't want another Trump, she said.
But there are common sense things that your government could do that would give Americans more opportunities to succeed. Why don't we do it? Because powerful special interests and the tendency to put ideology ahead of political progress have led to gridlock in Congress. And how can you not be frustrated, and even angry, when you see nothing getting done? And a lot of people feel no one is on their side and no one has their back. And that is not how it's supposed to be in America. If I am fortunate enough to be your President, I will have your back every single day that I serve.
But a lot of people who have, you know, been in the area of government ethics say that probably wouldn't go far enough because, you know, Trump built these businesses. He knows them very well, and he knows how these businesses would be affected by almost any decision he makes. I mean just given the scope of his businesses, all of them - all the ones that he owns - I mean almost anything he does as president potentially affects them.
So, he said, a wealthy donor can give to a credible institution like Schwab, through a donor-advised fund. Then that money will be donated to these anti-Muslim organizations, which are registered as nonprofits or social welfare organizations, through the wealth management group. The donor gets a tax deduction and can make the contribution anonymously.
Since serving as president, President Clinton has devoted himself to lifting people around the world, Romney said then. And one of the best things to happen to any cause, to any people, is to have Bill Clinton as its advocate.
GRAVES: We did not ask them. The Washington Post, which broke this story, did ask about that question. And basically the state chamber said that they're not active - really active in these fights. Well, I can tell you we watch it in cities and states across the country. And those state chambers are super active in these fights. Forty-nine of the 50 chambers have actively opposed to increase the minimum wage. They've been active in opposing paid sick leave. And that question of why is really interesting. It turns out that the state chambers have a close alliance with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
The Business Roundtable, a group of executives from some of America's biggest companies, criticized Trump's tactics as counterproductive.
So how do you persuade millions or billions of people around the world to sacrifice that? To avert climate disaster, the fertility rate would have to fall much faster than it has been. It would require more than educating women and expanding access to contraception, as aid agencies have been doing for decades.

Earlier this year, DeVos called HBCUs 'real pioneers when it comes to school choice,' a remark she was forced to walk back after protests; in fact, these colleges were founded as the only option for students when other colleges were still legally segregated. Just this week, DeVos found herself clarifying comments by President Trump that seemed to suggest that a key form of funding for HBCUs might be unconstitutional.
That's kind of similar to what you saw in 2008 where Hillary Clinton's supporters - only about 60 percent said that they would go to Barack Obama. The difference here, though, is that more Sanders people seem to not like Hillary Clinton than Clinton folks liked Barack Obama.

A near record number of Massachusetts residents are signing up for coverage through the state's online insurance market, the Health Connector. Enrollment is running 32 percent ahead of last year as the Jan. 31 deadline approaches. Around 47,000 people who didn't have insurance through the exchange last year have purchased insurance for 2017.
But as the concept gained popularity, concerns grew, particularly among media and political elites, about the threat of online mobs shutting down speech. That perceived punitive atmosphere came to be known as cancel culture, and people on the left were often accused of perpetuating it.

Of course, that's overall household income. As far as hourly wages themselves, it is true that wage growth has been slower than it used to be. Since the recession, wages have struggled to creep much above inflation. But just in the past year, wages have risen 2.5 percent.
Then again, most rural towns this size probably haven't had the steady pipeline of tax revenue from natural gas pumped off nearby federal land to pay for it. The opening of the center, more than a decade ago, convinced its now director Amber Anderson to move back home after college in 2018 as a young professional.
This was sort of surprising, in fact, because all of us have heard this claim that businesses oppose these measures. Some of these chambers will be able to bring forth a couple of businesses to be examples to speak out against these measures. But it turns out that those businesses are the outliers, that most businesses, when they're asked, most executives when they're asked support these
MIKE DEBONIS: Hey, thanks for having me.
ELVING: The question, of course, here was, are you going to raise taxes? And, of course, the answer is inevitably yes. But she is saying, let's look at the total picture. Families are going to be better off. Their costs overall are going to be lower. And if they are paying a little more in tax, look at the people who are going to be paying a lot more in tax. And let's talk about the big corporations. And let's talk the very richest taxpayers. We're really going to go after them. As for the middle class, well, they'll have to chip in more in taxes, but they'll save so much more in their other costs. That's the pitch.
For years, Congress mostly used reconciliation for deficit reduction, said Zach Moller, deputy director of economic programs at the center-left think tank Third Way and a former Democratic staffer on the Senate Budget Committee.

TOLSON: Well, I think he's done well for jobs. Obviously, the statistics out there are showing that jobs are on the rise. I think the border wall - he's getting a lot of opposition there. But I think his stance on trying to move forward with illegal people coming into the country - we see that those statistics are down, so I think he's making progress there. So I think that those two things are definitely part of what he's wanting to move forward. And that seems to be getting support in moving forward.
KING: And we shouldn't assume that just because Democrats could get this done without Republicans that they necessarily would.
JULIAN CASTRO: I'm fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you're not.
ROBERTS: (Laughter) No law does require it. The law that some House members want to employ to force the IRS to turn over Trump's returns is a very obscure section of the tax code. And it allows the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee to demand any tax filer's returns. It dates back to the Teapot Dome scandals of the 1920s, when members of the Harding administration were accepting bribes. Congress had to rely on the executive for financial information, so they made this law. It's been rarely used. But the Republican members of the Ways Means Committee did employee it a few years ago when they were investigating what they called the IRS' discrimination against conservative organizations.

Included in the bill is another round of direct stimulus payments to Americans, an additional $300 a week in unemployment benefits and monthly payments to families with children that Democrats claim could halve child poverty. But the Biden administration's first big legislative priority will likely pass without any bipartisan support. Republicans balk at the price tag and also the way this money is being spent.

Right now, for low-income people who would not have a sizable income tax liability, their eligibility to the child tax credit is tied to their earnings. And what President Biden and Vice President Harris are proposing is to remove that earnings connection. So the result would be that all children essentially would receive the full child tax credit, which would now be increased.

Well, that was not a reality 10 - more than 10 years ago. So that has changed. So we've gotten closer clearly. You know, how we get the rest of the way, you know, to what extent it involves building on the architecture of the Affordable Care Act versus tearing that architecture down, putting something new in its place, I think that is the debate going forward.

They're going to need more wiggle room for the states to decide what's best for people in their states.

The LIBRE Initiative's new effort takes place within that context. They will send mailers to more than 100,000 homes, thanking Democrats and Republicans for their work on a legislative fix for DREAMers.
And we're going to invest $10 billion in Make it in America partnerships to support American manufacturing and recommit to scientific research that can create entire new industries.
Still, he worries an Obamacare repeal without a timely, adequate replacement could cause some insurers to pull out of the exchange or charge higher rates. Already consumers saw premiums go up and choice go down this year. And this is pressing — insurers have to file rate requests in Colorado in May. So the clock is ticking, Patterson says. Somebody has to give us a little more guidance I think to the industry around what the new world is going to look like. And I think the sooner we do that the better it is for every consumer.
President-elect Donald Trump says he will double the nation's growth rate during his time in office. That promise will be difficult to keep.
HORSLEY: Yeah. It's a big increase. And it would likely require China to stop buying some stuff from other countries in order to shift their purchases to the United States. But, you know, China is a very big market. Some economists I spoke to said it is possible to hit this target. China's expected to buy more factory products, more energy, more services and, of course, more soybeans. Farmers have been hard hit by the trade war.
Mullainathan's latest study, co-authored with Supreet Kaur, Suanna Oh, and Frank Schilbach, is a field experiment with 408 workers over a couple weeks at a factory in Odisha, India. The workers at the factory make disposable plates used at local eateries. In this part of India, the authors say, workers split their time between agriculture during the planting and harvesting season, and doing odd jobs the other part of the year. When the researchers conducted the study, it was the part of the year when they were the most cash-strapped and in debt.

While Kudlow maintained an outward show of confidence, he also said he's pleased that the Federal Reserve has stopped raising interest rates for the time being. The sharp drop in December's retail sales is likely to reinforce the Fed's more cautious approach.
ORNSTEIN: Yeah. Dennis Hastert, who in many ways corrupted the legislative process when he was speaker, turned out to be somewhat more corrupt in other ways. When there's so much money involved in Congress, there's no doubt it can be corrupting. At the same time, you've got to find ways to get majority support for bills that can cut across some ideological areas and keep the government moving. It's trading things to get votes. Sometimes there's a price to be paid. We had plenty of this in one of the most exemplary pieces of legislation, the famous 1986 tax reform package that everybody points to as a way in which you want to make policy and improve the economy by reducing the rates and broadening the base and not draining the deficits.
Regretfully, it is now apparent that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure of Obamacare will not be successful, McConnell said. So, in the coming days, the Senate will vote to take up the House bill with the first amendment in order being what a majority of the Senate has already supported in 2015 and that was vetoed by then-President Obama: a repeal of Obamacare with a two-year delay to provide for a stable transition period to a patient-centered health care system that gives Americans access to quality, affordable care.
SANDERS: Let's talk about democratic socialism, not communism, Mr. Bloomberg. That's a cheap shot.
Res said the mistakes started in the 1980s, when Trump paid $365 million for the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle and $400 million for the Plaza Hotel.
Trump also pointed out guests in the chamber whose children had allegedly been killed by the MS-13 gang, and he called on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminals, to break into our country.
At least, he says, there's beer in the stores, and he plans to spend Columbus Day drinking a few at the beach with the town's huge statue towering over them.
OSNOS: Yeah, as a candidate, he and certainly everybody in his campaign that I spoke to described their intention to uproot Obamacare root and branch. They talked about the replacing it, though it's not clear what that would be. Since then, he has changed his view on that.
This health care bill failure makes it all the more difficult, not just for momentum — and that's no small thing — but because of the hundreds of millions (originally $1 trillion) in tax cuts that the health care bill would have provided. That would have been a big head start on tax cuts.
Her bad instincts and her bad judgment – something pointed out by Bernie Sanders – are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today. Let's review the record.
BOOKER: Sometimes I'd get the strangest requests. And during Hurricane Sandy - I couldn't believe it, but I saw somebody tweet me and asked me to bring them some Hot Pockets. So I jokingly told them hey, this is a problem you can handle. I believe in you. But the next thing I knew, the company Hot Pockets sent me a thousand free coupons for Hot Pockets, which I donated to a food pantry, except for I gave a few to the young man who was bold enough in the midst of a hurricane to ask me for Hot Pockets.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: And to what do you owe this recent openness to talk?
Americans agree: Taxes are too complicated (but that's no reason to cheat). There are a few more areas where Americans tend to agree across party lines: nearly 9 in 10 believe the tax code is too complicated, three-quarters say it's not OK for people to underreport income on their taxes, and 77 percent say their own personal federal income taxes are too high.
My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian, think of this. Think of this, this is not believable but this is what's happening. A 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country already under the leadership of President Obama.
NPR's Scott Horsley covered that crisis, is here for this crisis. Scott, good morning.
The Tax Policy Center analysis shows that for most of the next decade, most of those people would be wrong. As stated above, in 2018, only 5 percent of taxpayers would have tax hikes, and by 2025, only 9 percent would.
Some housing advocates have said they have goosebumps at the idea of launching campaigns all across the state to get local towns to adopt the new rules.
As we've reported, Philadelphia passed a tax on sweetened beverages earlier this year. And researchers documented a decline in sales of sugary drinks in Mexico after a tax was passed in 2014.
Frustrated with this system, Phyllis Schlafly lambasted the establishment in A Choice Not An Echo, as Dave Weigel wrote at the Washington Post earlier this year in his own dissection of the term. Schlafly uses a series of anecdotes to show how groups of kingmakers, including businessmen and ambassadors, chose moderate candidates that went against what she thought were the GOP's interests.

Tom Price, the secretary of Health and Human Services, has fallen on his prescription pen - let me put it that way - resigned just before he was probably going to be fired after reports his department chartered private jets for the secretary. At the same time, the Trump administration is assailed for failing to come to the aid of Puerto Rico. Congress failed again to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and now the party's trying to overhaul the tax code. A lot to talk about with Mary Kate Cary who was a speechwriter for President George H.W. Bush. She's now a senior fellow for presidential studies at the University of Virginia. Mary Kate, thanks so much for joining us this morning.
KELLY: These are things you are suggesting...
Kenya repealed its value added tax on pads and tampons in 2004 to lower the price consumers pay. And since 2011, the Kenyan government has been budgeting about $3 million per year to distribute free sanitary pads in schools in low-income communities.
WARREN: These are the ideas that we need to embrace to build a future - not for those at the top, but to build a future for everyone going forward. That's why I'm in this fight.
As I've traveled this country, through all fifty states; as I've rejoiced with you and mourned with you, what I've also seen, more than anything, is what is right with America, Obama will say. I see people working hard and starting businesses; people teaching kids and serving our country. I see a younger generation full of energy and new ideas, unconstrained by what is, and ready to seize what ought to be.
Much of the early criticism revolves around the scope of the plan, which backers say is big to match the challenge of the climate change problem.

MARTIN: Now, you went to MIT and majored in what, engineering? Right?
[True — personal consumption expenditures make up around 69 percent of GDP. That has climbed by about 10 percentage points since the late 1960s. (Wonky aside: Those expenditures include a few things you don't directly spend your own money on, like employer-paid health insurance.) That implies that more money in people's pockets would do a lot to drive growth. However, as the St. Louis Fed found in 2012, higher investment spending — another component of GDP that involves things like businesses buying new equipment — is associated with higher growth. — Danielle Kurtzleben]
But that all changed when he moved to emphasize a conservative social agenda— a failed attempt to ban gay marriage; an abortion law that it makes it illegal for a woman to have an abortion because of a fetal abnormality; and perhaps more important, he signed into law a provision that allowed businesses with religious objections to refuse services to LGBT customers.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, let me ask you, what were some of the challenges in a rural area that are different from the city?
Trump has proposed a major corporate tax cut, as he indicates here. His plan would bring the top federal corporate income tax rate down to 15 percent from 35 percent. (Many businesses actually pay a much lower effective tax rate than 35 percent, thanks to deductions and other loopholes.)
Bush was elected [in] November 2000 and was president for eight years. If you were a disgruntled Democrat and applied for immigration to Canada at the beginning of 2001, it would take about 18 months to 30 months to finalize the permanent resident application, he wrote in an email. He reads that as a spike because of Bush's election, followed by a downturn that he attributes to both President Obama's election and the economic crisis.
Moreover, 3.5 to 4 percent is a growth rate the U.S. economy hasn't seen in a long time, as NPR's Scott Horsley recently reported.
But that didn't apply to Trump. The national debt increased by $8 trillion under the outgoing president to almost $28 trillion. Trump's tax cuts alone cost $2.3 trillion.
Medicare for all – often described as a national, single-payer health system built on the Medicare model — has become a rallying cry for some progressive Democrats. Meanwhile, New Mexico is one of several states looking at offering consumers a different type of government-sponsored plan to provide a health care option that's more affordable than current options.
FEMA would receive $2 billion for its Disaster Relief Fund account. It's the account that's used for helping states and local government with the costs of cleaning up from hurricanes and tornadoes. The administration wants to use the fund to support potentially all 56 States and Territories for COVID-19 response efforts, including for direct Federal assistance, temporary facilities, commodities, equipment, and emergency operations costs. The Department estimates that this level funding would be sufficient for this purpose along with ongoing and future emergencies.

Early in the Trump administration, officials took aim at one of former President Barack Obama's key climate policies: limits on emissions from the dirtiest power plants, a policy known as the Clean Power Plan.
Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said the plan is an acknowledgement that acts of discrimination took place. And that you not only have the specific result of the act, but that there is a cumulative effect of being discriminated against that grows over time. And in order for us to have an equitable and a fair USDA, it's necessary for us to address that gap.
Rossello — and many economists — argue that these laws do the opposite of what proponents want and actually make housing less affordable by reducing the supply.
In this respect, an NPR/Ipsos Poll released Thursday appears to back him up. Nearly two-thirds of respondents approved of national teachers unions, and three-quarters said teachers have the right to strike.
HORSLEY: That's right, and we've seen that deceleration already from a sort of peak last spring. It's slowed with each quarter. Right now we're at around 2 percent or maybe even less than 1 percent in the current quarter. So what we're seeing is a deceleration.

The organization's policies and procedures have always required that grants recommended by its donors are made only to qualified charitable organizations, and that funds are used exclusively in furtherance of charitable purposes. Fidelity Charitable reviews its granting practices regularly and doesn't hesitate to implement changes that it believes ensure better grantmaking to IRS-qualified, 501(c)(3) public charities for exclusively charitable purposes.
HARRIS: Yeah. That - ultimately, we want to know - what we can say right now is, even if you can't get a test, if you have flu-like symptoms, the public health officials are saying, for heaven's sakes, stay home. You don't need to know whether it's this disease or flu or something else. Just stay home, isolate, and make sure you're not spreading it. So we don't actually need the test for that.
The vote-arama is also a time when senators will try to undo parts of the budget resolution through amendments and an objection known as a budget point of order.
But ignoring the new limit could create headaches for people who have already made the maximum HSA contribution for the year based on the $6,900 figure, says Roy Ramthun, president of HSA Consulting Services. If you don't ask the bank that handles your HSA to return the $50 plus any earnings that have accrued before the next tax season, your taxable income will be off by that amount, plus you'll be on the hook for a 6 percent penalty for exceeding the maximum contribution allowed.
You don't see that in Nepal, Bangladesh or India. In Nepal and Bangladesh, the government simply doesn't have the resources. There is no tax base to support that robust response and recovery system. Their process to rebuild is complicated by underlying development issues that are inherent in those countries.

During his campaign, Trump said that he was against expanding background checks and that the current system needs to be fixed.
EISBRENNER: You know, I think it's a slight improvement. I don't think it's the answer, though. I really don't. I don't think it's going to help everybody across the board - no. And that's why my belief is keep the government out of health care. The government, really, anything they get involved in, for the most part, in my opinion, they don't do a good job at it. You know, my daughter had to go get an Obamacare policy, and it saved her bacon, you know, with some things going on. She got a policy. But then, for every story of my daughter, there's 50 where people went the opposite way. It really screwed them over.
House Speaker Paul Ryan had issued a statement saying many members feel that after eight years, the office is in need of reform. Ryan argued the office would continue to operate independently and still take complaints from members of the public. He said the House Ethics Committee would merely provide oversight of the complaints office but insisted that the office is not controlled by the committee.
President Trump's support among independent voters has eroded since he took office. Though he still clings to a loyal base of supporters, his overall disapproval among Americans has reached record highs, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.
Even though in the end the recipients of the money, the people they were paying, were charities, it doesn't matter. You're still buying something that you're going to keep for yourself, and you can't do that with the charity's money.

In Arizona, the AEU has announced five central demands — among which are 20 percent raises for teachers and certified staff in the next school year, smaller class sizes, and yearly bumps in pay until the state reaches the national average salary, which hovers at nearly $59,000 per year for public school teachers.
Mark Mazur, director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said others may face challenges similar to Wright's predicament. He said people who have children older than 17 are not eligible for the standard child tax credit; instead they get a smaller dependent credit and lose a personal exemption. People who had large deductions for state and local taxes now have those deductions capped at $10,000. His organization estimates that 6 percent of households will see an individual income tax hike this year.
Second, our thinking will evolve – as it has here – and should. We not only make decisions, we review them, we consider their effects and we learn from them. This too is characteristic of a healthy ethical newsroom guided by sound ethical principles.

Ultimately, the late help will still probably be enough to pull Estes over the finish line on Tuesday, and there's been no major late surge of interest by national Democrats in the race that would signify that they have a real chance of pulling off an upset. In fact, the state party turned down requests from Thompson for help last month.
A two-page tax return, filed by Trump for 2005 and revealed Tuesday, may suggest one reason. Because of the AMT, Trump was required to pay about $38 million in taxes on income of more than $150 million that year.

There's no sense of any sort of personal warmth between the two of them. But just how critical a factor was McConnell in getting Trump's agenda through? I mean, you point out that he got more than 200 federal judges pushed through. He got three very conservative judges on the Supreme Court pushed through. So how closely tied to whatever victories Trump did achieve was Mitch McConnell?
Trump Makes Bipartisan Pitch In First State Of The Union, But Also Plays To Base

There were a few moments in Trump's speech that yielded applause from both Democrats and Republicans, such as when Trump hailed Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó in the House gallery, a signal of bipartisan support for Guaidó and his efforts to restore democracy in Venezuela.
I think he knows his way around financial markets, which some people in Washington thinks disqualify you from being treasury secretary. I actually think it could be useful if we have another financial crisis. But he's not been one of these bankers or business people who's been around Washington a lot.

In this case though, I have to say, when I first read the tweet, you know, you're just shocked. I was shocked at the the mayor's speech last night begging for help and saying that people were dying. That was heartbreaking to hear. But this feels to me like it fits in a theme that he has had for a while starting with his inaugural, which is to side on the side of the forgotten people.

That's not going to amount to a lot of money, but there's more than financial pain to consider, Ramthun says. Do you really want to give the IRS a reason to come find you?
ARTHUR LAFFER: I think they are terrific. I think the corporate tax in the U.S. today is not only global in scope, which is a mistake - we have the single highest tax rate in the OECD - and it's discouraging businesses, jobs, output, employment coming to the U.S. It's driving business away through inversions and through formation of companies elsewhere. Dropping that tax rate to 15 percent would have a huge impact on the U.S. economy and would have very little impact, if any, on tax revenues from corporations, from businesses.

Long story short: It would lower the debt level but raise the interest rate the U.S. is paying altogether, essentially trading one problem for the other. Why would we do that? In Baker's telling, this is a solution only insofar as someone cares a lot about nominal debt levels and debt-to-GDP ratios (and it's not clear that Trump does).

PARKER: Yeah, I agree with what Cokie has said. I mean, none of your business is never the right answer if you're running for president because as she says, everything is your business. But of course, the reason Donald Trump doesn't want to have anyone look as his tax returns is because one, he probably does not have as much money as he says he does, doesn't - that's - most people on the Republican side who are not Trump supporters think that's the case. And then also his tax rate - at least he was honest about that. He doesn't pay enough taxes in the view of people who are looking very closely at raising tax rates on the rich.
The legislation increases the existing child tax credit to $3,000 for children 6 to 17 and $3,600 for children under 6. The amount is gradually reduced for couples earning over $150,000 and individuals earning more than $75,000 per year. Families eligible for the full credit would get payments of $300 per child for young children and $250 for older children, per month, from July 2021 through the end of the year.
Disputes over post-production costs have popped up all over the country as oil and gas production has soared, the result of new horizontal drilling and fracking technologies that allow drillers to tap into shale rock.
MOORE: If he's done anything illegal, you know, it's out there. If he's cheated on his taxes, he's been audited, you know, dozens and dozens of times. And if people don't want to vote for him 'cause he's not going to release his tax forms, that's his own business. But I feel pretty strong - I mean, I can't say anything good that can come out of this, you know, him releasing his tax forms.

He did the same thing to a kitchen equipment company, a cabinetmaker, a music store owner. He owed $3.9 million to a company that supplied marble for his properties. That business had to shut down, and eventually, the owner had to file for personal bankruptcy: the cost of doing business with Donald Trump. Now, Donald Trump doesn't think going bankrupt is a big deal — but it's devastating if you're someone who plays by the rules.

Nicole Kaeding, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation think tank, cautioned against getting angry for the wrong reasons. The Tax Foundation had advocated the 2017 tax overhaul as being pro-growth.
But it's not clear exactly how many Americans have pre-existing conditions and could be affected. Estimates vary widely because there is not a standard definition of what counts as a pre-existing condition. Before the ACA passed, insurers commonly refused coverage for people with cancer, heart failure, diabetes, arthritis and even less serious conditions.
The virus affected Capitol Hill directly as a staffer to Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., became the first known confirmed case of coronavirus on the campus. The aide has been in isolation since developing symptoms, and Cantwell closed her office for cleaning, according to a statement.

We posed the following statement to people as a true or false question: For the highest earners, the percent of federal income taxes they pay now is significantly higher than it was in 1980.
But Democrats have now successfully jumped through most of the procedural hoops. Passage of the bill represents the biggest change in domestic policy since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965, says Sara Rosenbaum, who chairs the department of health policy at George Washington University.
Yet the protesting teachers have already rejected this proposal, calling it unsustainable as it is currently drawn up. Teachers groups, including the Arizona Parent Teacher Association, argue that under the plan the raise would simply cause woes for others in the state's educational system.
God bless you, and goodnight. I love you.
But one thing that's really important to most Americans is homeownership - the value of their home, not the stock markets, their major asset. And housing prices have been rising. That's good for people who own houses, not so good for people who want to buy them. But there is one striking disparity - 73% of non-Hispanic whites own their own homes but only 43% of blacks. And that gap has been widening. Homeownership rates are lower for black people who've graduated from college than they are for white people who are high school dropouts.

One of the book's case studies is the Chicago teacher strike in 2012, which she argues is the forerunner to this year's protests. She also points to the defeat of a ballot question on charter school expansion in Massachusetts in 2016 as a major recent teacher union victory. And she says the Bernie Sanders effect in states like West Virginia, which handed him a primary victory in every county, laid the groundwork for the populist economic message that is resonating now.

Indeed, a KHN investigation in 2019 found that, nationwide, 45% of nonprofit hospital organizations were routinely sending medical bills to patients whose incomes were low enough to qualify for charity care. Those bills, which totaled $2.7 billion, were most likely an undercount since they included only the debt hospitals had given up trying to collect.
Four years down the line, eight years down the line, depending on the makeup of the Supreme Court, depending on who is president, I can see the gay/transgender issue being pushed in a way that would seek to make Christian colleges either surrender their federal funding or change their position and conform with the wider consensus, says Carl Trueman, a professor of church history at Westminster Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania.

Democrats are convinced that Republicans are making a risky bet putting up a wall of opposition to the relief bill. Several recent polls indicate that 7 in 10 Americans support the $1.9 trillion plan, and in some cases a majority of Republican voters back the legislation. White House officials point to GOP mayors and other state officials who say the economic devastation from the pandemic demands a bold federal response.
CORNISH: So is this, in part, a backlash against education policies that were once seen as innovative?
CYNTHIA NIXON: I think that the media and the polls are not capturing this progressive moment that we're in and how hungry voters are for an alternative to the establishment, for people like me who, aren't accepting any corporate money, and for people like me, who are speaking about the issues that voters really care about, like single-payer health care, like Housing is a Human Right, like fully funding education, which is an issue that I've been fighting on for 17 years, and real criminal justice reform.
The version of the legislation that passed the House would have increased the payments to $400 per week through the end of August. The change is a compromise between progressive members who wanted enhanced benefits for several more months and moderate Democrats who wanted to curb the weekly payments. The updated version of the bill would make the first $10,200 of unemployment benefits received in 2020 nontaxable.
SEBRELL: In the '80s and the early '90s, there was a big focus on education in North Carolina, and we were a leader in the country. It's all about cost cutting and budgets and things now. And it's tough to be in a rural area when that is happening.
MCCAMMON: Trump used the moment to remind supporters that he and Romney had stood together just four years ago.
While Pence may seem boring next to Trump, he has important qualities that Trump does not have.

KHALID: Now, of course, there's no way to know if Trump has paid taxes because he hasn't released his returns. But the Clinton camp is eager to use this as an attack line. They've already turned the issue into a new cable TV ad.
And a lot of people want to make their living by making and creating things. If there's one point of agreement, it may be: The Internet should make that easier, not harder.
MARTIN: All right, so let's talk about the political implications of all this because I imagine there's a lot at stake here. The president has been unable to get Republicans behind some kind of overhaul of the health care plan - repeal and replace - so he needs this. But what does the path to passing a tax overhaul bill look like at this point?
Batchelder says that calculation is misleading because it focuses on tax rate reduction rather than a family's after-tax income — in other words, how much money they have in their pocket after taxes.
Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference took a dramatic turn this past week with former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleading guilty to lying to the FBI and publicly vowing to cooperate with Mueller.

Still, Lee's hopefulness is tempered by the knowledge that California faces a loss of $20 billion in federal funds if the promised Obamacare repeal happens without a replacement that preserves Medicaid expansion and premium subsidies.
The amazing thing is that the Modi government passed these laws in the middle of a pandemic!

School districts are also looking at hiring tutors and instructors for summer school, and planning ahead for fall, when they face the prospect of trying to help students catch up after a year where some were in school and some were at home. There's a lot of damage to repair, said Matthew Blomstedt, education commissioner for the state of Nebraska.
This week, the president and the White House clarified his stance. At a CNN town hall on Tuesday night, Biden was asked if he would forgive up to $50,000 in debt. The president's reply: I will not make that happen. He went on to say, I understand the impact of debt, and it can be debilitating. I am prepared to write off the $10,000 debt but not $50 [thousand], because I don't think I have the authority to do it.
Ultimately, the GOP primary is shaping up to be a contest about who's the most conservative, and don't expect to see candidates shirk away from Trump as they play up their praise of Mulvaney. Whoever wins the nomination will be the heavy favorite come June.

The former California attorney general often touts her prosecutorial background as an asset, which could appeal to independents, but she's already faced backlash from some within the Democratic Party about her record. An analysis from Vox found that while she did support programs helping people find jobs instead of sending them to prison, she also fought to keep people in prison even after they were proved innocent. She refused to pursue the death penalty against a man who killed a police officer, but also defended California's death penalty system in court. She implemented training programs to address police officers' racial biases, but also resisted calls to get her office to investigate certain police shootings.

With open enrollment season for buying health coverage under the Affordable Care Act ending Tuesday, it seemed like an apt time to talk with folks in charge of some of the state insurance marketplaces created by the federal health law.
It's not nearly the benefit that paid-leave advocates had hoped for.
But Hunter Biden, they don't talk about him. What happened to Hunter? Where's Hunter? Where's Hunter? They don't talk about him. They'll watch, all the sets will go off. Well, they can't do that because they get good ratings. Their ratings are too good. Now, where's Hunter? You know.
But shopkeepers say no one has been buying much since Iraq devalued its dinar against the dollar last year.
He says Chesapeake Energy, which operates four wells on his farm, is stealing from him, and he has joined a class-action lawsuit against the company. Chesapeake, which declined to comment for this story, is defending itself against lawsuits in at least seven states for allegedly underpaying royalties.
Hazel's earlier ruling blocks the administration's plans for the question but did not find that there was enough evidence to support the discrimination or conspiracy allegations by plaintiffs in Maryland. That decision has been appealed to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
The White House and congressional Democrats point to public opinion polls showing overwhelming support for the legislation, including the backing from a majority of Republicans in some surveys. While no GOP lawmakers in Congress voted for it, Democrats point out that some Republican state and local government officials are pressing for the aid.
It began when Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner was asked if a middle-class tax hike might be necessary in order to control the ballooning deficit.
Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said on Wednesday that the law is crystal clear that the Treasury Department must adhere to Neal's request.
Abedin then followed up, offering the crown prince a sitdown with Clinton. If u see him, let him know, she wrote Band. We have reached out through official channels.
Donald Trump aligned himself strongly with the National Rifle Association, which endorsed him, and also with Second Amendment protectionists (though no major candidate claimed to want to take away gun rights outright). Trump has said states should be more diligent about putting criminal and mental health records into existing background check systems.

She lives in Newburgh, N.Y., a former industrial town on the Hudson River about two hours north of Manhattan. She says most apartment owners in Newburgh do the bare minimum to maintain a unit, and if tenants complain, they get evicted.
Now, it's all gotten more complicated here after Turkey invaded last fall, and together with its Russian allies, pushed out the American forces, reducing their presence by about half to an area, really, roughly the size of Vermont. Now, when we were in Syria last week, we were with soldiers from the West Virginia National Guard. They actually came under attack guarding these oil fields from armed drones. A handful of mortars were dropped and narrowly missed them. U.S. investigators say the bombs were sophisticated. And, Rachel - get this - some of the components, they say, were made by 3D printers.
Trump's decision is the starkest break from traditional GOP economic philosophy on trade since taking office. The president has found few GOP allies on Capitol Hill, but Rust Belt Democrats up for re-election this year cheered the administration's decision. This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating, said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio. Likewise, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., called Trump's decision a welcome step.
Of course, if hatred of the government started the anti-establishment fire this cycle, other factors stoked it.
In pushing their new tax plan, Republicans have touted these policies as boons for the economy. Full expensing for businesses could boost economic growth, and the tax credit would help middle-class families, they argue. In addition, conservatives have long said they think the estate tax is double taxation.
INSKEEP: On a professional level, did you agree with more than you disagreed about, about how to do economics, how to do forecasting?
New Mexico's bill would target individuals who aren't eligible for Medicaid or Medicare and those who can't get the Affordable Care Act's premium subsidies because their incomes are above 400 percent of the federal poverty level (about $50,000 for one person or $103,000 for a family of four). The plan would also be available to state residents whose immigration status in the U.S. is undocumented.
A number of other researchers are exploring the connections between the economy and our well-being. The study is the third in less than a year to show that raising the minimum wage may lower suicide rates, says Dr. Alexander Tsai, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard's Massachusetts General Hospital, who was not involved with the current research.
By the way, Pioneer is owned by Navient, the nation's largest servicer of federal and private student loans. In January, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed its own lawsuit against Navient, alleging that it illegally cheated borrowers out of their rights and their money — as much as $4 billion — through patterns of deception and misapplying payments.
A sharply divided court first ruled that the parents of a Mexican boy fatally shot by a U.S. Border Patrol agent cannot sue the officer who killed their son. Then, the court heard arguments in a free-speech case that will determine whether people who encourage illegal immigrants to remain in the country can be prosecuted.
I hoped there would be a change at the top when in the early, midsummer it was clear we had the wrong people leading the campaign, Wareham said, referring to when Trump began his rise.
This latest figure is in addition to the $100 billion package that's already been passed by the House of Representatives. We are going to spend the next several minutes talking through what all of this money would be used for, also where Congress stands on agreeing to it and how all this spending would track with the spread of the disease. To do all that, I am joined by a team of NPR reporters. They include chief economics correspondent Scott Horsley, congressional correspondent Kelsey Snell and, last but certainly not least, at an appropriately socially distance - I'd say you're eight feet away from me in the studio - our science correspondent Richard Harris.
Garland Confirmed As Attorney General 5 Years After Thwarted Supreme Court Bid
Her comments helped moderate expectations ahead of the first official hearing into the legislative proposals on presidential and vice presidential tax returns. The academic panel and narrow scope of the hearing before the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight were far from the explosive investigation into Trump's finance that some progressive Democrats have demanded.
Public Service Loan Forgiveness started in 2007; the first participants were set to have their loans forgiven this coming fall. The retroactive aspect of this filing reasonably causes people to be nervous, Robert Shireman, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, told NPR Ed. He was also a deputy undersecretary in the Obama Education Department, where Shireman was responsible for overseeing the program during its early years.

Of course, this general idea doesn't help a lot in laying out exact tax brackets. Assigning a numerical value to how much utility every single person gets from an additional dollar is impossible. People are just too different, explains one tax expert.
UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: And I think we can say with certainty that it's up to us. It is up to us to fight for our kids and to fight for our state.
SAGAL: Sounds like something a mother would say to their 8-year-old. Johnny, do not - stop using your nose as an input device in church. It's gone even further. One nose-tapper of the watch went and programmed the fingerprint scanner on his iPhone to accept his nose as identification.
She continued, To me, he's so fake. He is saying whatever you want to hear. I just don't think he's honest. That's my opinion.
SMITH: Absolutely. We, unfortunately, have neglected our infrastructure over the years, and much of our infrastructure is nearing the end of its useful life. And we're at a point now where we cannot kick this can further and further down the road as we've been doing for many, many years now. And we need to invest in it. And we're realizing that maintenance of infrastructure is critical. It's not just the upfront costs we have to consider. It's the lifecycle costs, and it's the maintenance for a developed country like this with an interstate system that was built under Eisenhower back in the 1950s and navigable waterways built in the early 1900s under Roosevelt. We have a lot of work to do.
And there are some very smart people working to get tax cheats to change their ways.
DAVIES: Gosh, it's hard to imagine after all of the harsh rhetoric about the Iran deal and what a terrible giveaway it was and all the money that he could back away from it.
GROSS: So you think that whether the Gulf of Tonkin happened or not, Congress should have revisited the issue, and that's the larger problem.
OSNOS: That, I think, is one of his better bets. He's got a Republican Congress on his side. And at this point, it's hard to see them not doing it.
FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.
So it may be true that Donald Trump is not personally a target of an investigation. But when you have this many senior members of an administration who are all in legal hot water, all in connecting ways, that's not a great look for any kind of president.
A lot of the kids here are what I call couch-to-classroom, Stacy Phillips, the founder and CEO of Pee Wee Prep, told me. In other words, before they enrolled in school here, they were home watching TV on the couch.
BUTLER: So there was an important case decided this week that didn't have anything to do with abortion. It's called Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt. Hyatt is a very technical case about sovereign immunity. The question was whether a state can face a private lawsuit in another state's court without its consent. So in a sense, it's like one of the 150 cases the court considers every year. It's very technical. It doesn't have far-reaching implications. In another sense, in this political and legal climate, it's a profound case because what the conservative majority did in Hyatt was to overturn precedent that was 40 years old. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the majority opinion. He barely bothered to explain why the court was overturning this very old precedent. He just said that precedent isn't an inexorable command. And since we know that the five conservative Justices all have major reservations about Roe v. Wade, the only way that one of those justices might vote to uphold Roe is based on their respect for precedent. And the concern that some people have about this case decided this week, the Hyatt case, is that those five justices don't respect precedent enough to, for example, affirm Roe v. Wade.
Pomerantz believes Trump's overall losses in the 1990s were probably greater than $900 million. But there's no way to know for sure without seeing Trump's federal tax returns. He's the only major party candidate in the last 40 years who hasn't released them.
Looking ahead to the 2018 midterms, registered voters say they're more likely to vote for a Democratic member of Congress over a Republican one by a 10-point margin, 48 percent to 38 percent.

SALLY HELMS: He sounded like he really had an answer to that question.
But CREW's Bookbinder says it's important to release Trump's returns anyway, as other presidents have been doing for decades.
MARTIN: That was Jane Mayer. She's the chief Washington correspondent for The New Yorker. Her latest piece is titled, Why McConnell Dumped Trump. Jane Mayer, thanks so much for being with us.
At 6:31 a.m. in the early morning hours after voting had ended, Michigan suddenly reported 147,000 votes. An astounding 94% went to Joe Biden, who campaigned brilliantly from his basement. Only a couple of percentage points went to Trump.
A growing chorus of policy wonks is arguing we should channel populist discontent with Wall Street in a more productive direction. Instead of trying to hurt hedge funds by artificially inflating the price of a company that's basically Blockbuster for games, they say, we should mobilize to impose a tax on stock trading. This could help bring greater sanity to trading and limit one of Wall Street's competitive advantages: high-frequency trading with supercomputers that can make like gazillions of transactions per second.

For an American, the total metric tons of carbon dioxide saved by all of those measures over an entire lifetime of 80 years: 488. By contrast, the metric tons saved when a person chooses to have one fewer child: 9,441.
But it reached a point that people began to realize it's not sustainable and the government is just accumulating more debt and the banks are further away from solvency, says Paul Salem, president of the Middle East Institute in Washington, D.C.
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: Once you get to, like, the tippy tops on your 10 millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 or 70 percent.

Journalism is a dangerous trade in Russia.
We need to make sure we're concerned with not overheating the economy, Summers told NPR's Weekend Edition last month.
The 1996 welfare reform law ended previous cash assistance programs in favor of a state block grant program called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which added more red tape and reached fewer people. By 2019, fewer than 1 in 4 families in poverty received TANF cash assistance — compared with about 7 in 10 helped by the previous programs.
DAVIES: Evan Osnos is a staff writer for The New Yorker magazine. We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.
There is a mechanism, known as the committee access provision, that allows the tax writing committee to request tax records of any taxpayer from the secretary of the Treasury. It is unclear how the agency will respond to that request and whether it will stall or resist efforts to turn over Trump's personal returns to the panel.
KAMENETZ: But what also links these strikes in many places is that teachers are coming out against education reform, against charter schools in LA and Oakland and West Virginia, against performance and incentive pay in Denver.
The Clinton people don't want to do it because they don't want to alienate the Sanders voters who they want to come into their tent, assuming that she wins the nomination. And the Republicans don't want to do it because they're thrilled to have Sanders still in the race and taking down Hillary Clinton every day. So he has had - he has been totally unscathed in terms of his own record.
SIMON: We'll note Treasury Department now says that, for the moment, it won't comply with congressional requests to hand over President Trump's tax returns. And Julian Assange, arrested after Ecuador turned him out of their embassy in London. For those who worried, and I was among them, his cat was apparently resettled last year in a more conventional home. President Trump was once a big fan of Julian Assange's, wasn't he?
But we don't have that anymore. We don't have a fair media anymore. It's suppression. And you have to be very careful with that and they've lost all credibility in this country.
But the difference here and the point at which it may depart significantly from precedent in American history is how he defines what are the crimes and the infractions that would constitute grounds for deportation. So, for instance, is it that if somebody is convicted of a crime and goes to jail then therefore they can be deported? That will be one thing. But if it's that somebody can be stopped for a traffic infraction, for instance, or caught up in a raid at a factory or caught up in a raid at a boarding house, well then that would significantly change the way in which we understand deportation and the risks associated with it. So at this point, it's not entirely clear. He's talked about 2 to 3 million. Independent estimates say that if he follows through on the plan, he's talking about that that would be 5 million in the sort of short and medium term and then ultimately has talked about trying to achieve the deportation of all 11.3 estimated undocumented immigrants. But to get to $5 million, he would have to expand to something else which he said clearly on the campaign trail which is that people who have overstayed their visas would then be subject to deportation that that represents a large part of the number.
GREEN: Oh, please, let's do that.
Of the two small companies that did win leases, one is Regenerate Alaska, a subsidiary of Australia-based 88 Energy. The other is Knik Arm Services, a small Alaska company managed by an investor named Mark Graber.

Meeting With Republicans On COVID-19 Relief, White House Says Biden 'Will Not Settle'
With years of mounting debt and no savings, Stephanie Culp continues to make tough choices for her family. It's either pay these bills or it's — we don't eat, she says. That sometimes means cutting back on electricity bills or temporarily giving up the cellphones.
House Democrats plan to move quickly once the legislative text is released. House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., told reporters that he is on call to process the legislation with the goal of holding a vote on Thursday.
But tech leaders aren't worried about everything on the president-elect's plans. Their companies have billions of dollars in profits sitting overseas, which they say is because of high U.S. corporate tax rates. Presumably the companies would repatriate those profits if tax rates were lower, which is something at the top of Trump's agenda.
Over the years, he has reported on recessions and booms, crashes and rallies, and a long string of tax dodgers, insider traders, and Ponzi schemers. Most recently, he has focused on trade and the job market. He also worked as part of a team covering President Trump's business interests.
DAVIES: You know, there's a point of view that says, yeah, ideologues can have their say, but it's the chief of staff who controls the president's schedule that really moves the levers of power. Do you have an opinion about whether one will be more important than the other?
COURIC: OK, that was my second choice.
After five years, Borders traded a saw for a welder where he works indoors at SJX Jet Boats. The company got its start building the nimble, fast moving shallow water boats that were ideal for sportsmen on the wide Clearwater River that runs through Orofino. But they've since expanded into selling boats to the military, law enforcement and other industries.

MCEVERS: And NPR congressional correspondent Sue Davis, thanks a lot.
Trump played up his economic success and highlighted the GOP tax plan passed last month, the signature achievement of his first year in office.
It will be hard to have comparable coverage if they start with less money, Gail Wilensky, a health economist who ran the Medicare and Medicaid programs under President George H.W. Bush, said in an interview.
COURIC: Yeah, coming into the room, and President Bush was following him. And suddenly I had to do an interview with the president of the United States that I wasn't prepared to do. I was just getting a tour of the White House. So that was sort of where I found my career path before my eyes. But I was able to come up with enough questions to keep him there for something like 19 minutes and 20 seconds.
GRAVES: Well, I think with respect to the state Senate jurisdictions, often these states have much smaller Senates, meaning fewer members representing larger areas. So it's certainly possible that some of the state senators do represent areas, more urban areas, that are passing these measures. But in general what we're seeing is a bit different, which is that you see legislatures that are covering the entire state geographically and so numerically have a large number of rural representatives, often Republican or conservative representatives.
Karen Ko has raised about $1.2 million in France for her senior-care startup. But she says being in Paris is about more than business.
And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country.
Owners of pass-through businesses will be allowed to deduct up to 20 percent of their profits, reducing their effective tax rate to no more than 29.6 percent.
Other parts of Trump's agenda would require support from a friendly Republican Congress. Those include Trump's massive tax cut, the repeal of Obamacare, and that big new wall along the border with Mexico.
You're here wearing a button that says Bernie beats Trump.
We were talking on the program with Anthony Scaramucci, another Wall Street figure who has been close to Trump, and got a sense of that perspective when he was telling us everybody's being unfair to Wall Street, that Wall Street is blamed too much or blamed solely for the financial crisis. Let's listen to a little bit of that.
Here are some key aspects of the plan:
Immigration will also be a critical component, with the White House proposing to offer protections for people in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which is set to expire March 5. Under the plan outlined to congressional Republicans this week, the White House would support a 10- to 12-year path to citizenship for the roughly 700,000 undocumented immigrants currently enrolled in DACA who came to the country as children. The proposal would also offer that path to others who were eligible for DACA but not currently enrolled, which could be up to 1.8 million people in total.
NPR's Steve Inskeep talks to David Wessel of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution about rising income inequality amid the longest period of economic expansion in U.S. history.
DEBONIS: Right. We're about to enter basically the most precarious moment of this entire process. Yesterday was really probably the best day Republicans on Capitol Hill have had legislatively all year. They passed it through the House. The Senate Finance Committee wrapped up their consideration of the bill. But now that it goes to the House floor, a whole new set of political considerations comes into play. You've got a much narrower margin in the Senate than you do in the House. Any two senators - three senators, if they are concerned, they can hold up this bill - and - as far as changes to it.
The U.S. is one of only a few countries in the world that allow private individuals to own the minerals under their land, a policy that dates to the Founding Fathers as they sought to elevate private interests over those of the British Crown. This financial incentive to allow new drilling goes a long way in explaining the nation's natural gas boom. The National Association of Royalty Owners estimates some 12 million American landowners receive royalties for the exploitation of oil, gas and other mineral resources under their property.

Regularly, she says, women come to her office, and even behind closed doors, they can hardly say the words to describe what's wrong with their reproductive tract. They'll even say to me, 'I don't know why I'm having trouble saying this.' And that's not to disparage the women — that's just how effective the culture of shame is, even today.

Congress already appropriated $150 billion in the CARES Act for state and local governments, and not all this money's been spent, said James Comer, a Republican congressman from Kentucky, at a recent hearing about the relief.
And the way I put it in the - one of my columns today was that he's privatized compassion and nationalized intimidation. And what I mean by that is all the compassionate realms of government that help people in trouble - he's cutting them. All that tough - he got tough-man type parts of government - he's spending a lot more money on. So we're going to get a lot stronger government but maybe a little rougher one.
KELLY: The business side of things - I know you've been digging in on that, Ben. What is Virginia learning on the business side of things from other states?
Gun rights advocates and shooters have long argued that suppressors should not be regulated by the NFA and have made a public health argument for their use: Guns are loud. Everybody that you know that's an old shooter is deaf, says Michelle Camp, the leader of the Utah chapter of The Well-Armed Woman. To have the ability to get [suppressors] easier would be really helpful.

So what counts as Hispandering, and what doesn't? Who decides? Since Latinos are the largest minority group in the U.S., and, as you may have heard, Hispanic voters have the numbers to move the needle in next year's election, we're digging into the history and evolution of a term we'll probably be hearing again.
Senate Republicans on Thursday released a revised version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act, their plan to replace the Affordable Care Act.
This vague combination of party elites and wealthy kingmakers (for example, the Rockefeller family), who supposedly ran the show, began to decline in the 1960s and 1970s, writes Halberstam. His reasons: Vietnam proved that the establishment could make bad decisions, and, as more Americans attended college on the G.I. Bill, the hungry, driven children of the meritocracy were able to surpass the scions of wealthy families.
ELVING: ...The nation would hear this stunning announcement on a Sunday morning.
More than half of people who purchase insurance in the health exchanges get the additional help, which reduces out-of-pocket health spending on deductibles and coinsurance. While that help for consumers is required under the law, the funding was not specifically included. (Tax credits for people with incomes up to four times the poverty level to help defray the cost of premiums are a separate program and were permanently funded in the ACA.)
Right now, the economy is not driving American politics, he said. You don't have unemployment at a 50-year low while at the same time you've got a president who has never ever had a 50% job approval rating in any credible national poll.
Like most other progressives, Jayapal is stressing the fact she still sees the Biden White House as a good faith ally, albeit an ally she and other progressives will have many tactical disagreements with. It's been a very good relationship. That doesn't mean we're not going to tussle and tangle at times.

He even credits the conservative Libre Initiative, a Koch-funded nonprofit, for its approach to winning over the Latino electorate — which recently included handing out Thanksgiving turkeys to low-income Hispanic churchgoers in exchange for filling out a questionnaire. He says Libre put political operatives in key states early in the 2016 election cycle and hired truly bilingual spokesmen.
McConnell worked with Trump over his four years in the White House. The Senate leader shepherded Trump's tax cuts through Congress and got a record number of judges confirmed to the federal bench.
The latest report — published on Monday and called Public Good or Private Wealth? — says that in 2018, the world's 26 richest people had as much as the poorest 3.8 billion combined. In 2017, it was 43 individuals.
Senator FRANK LAUTENBERG (Democrat, New Jersey; Chairman, Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee): If I didn't cause the problem, I don't want to pay for the problem.

That relies on the economy growing at 2.8% this year and 3% thereafter — growth that exceeds the outlook from the Federal Reserve, Congressional Budget Office and private forecasters. Actual GDP growth was 2.9% in 2018 and slowed to 2.3% in 2019.
Starting Tuesday, California is sending out workers to knock on doors as part of a sort of mini-census the state is officially calling the California Neighborhoods Count.
By the way, Pennsylvania has now seen all of this. They didn't know because it was so quick. They had a vote. They voted. But now they see all this stuff, it's all come to light. Doesn't happen that fast. And they want to recertify their votes. They want to recertify. But the only way that can happen is if Mike Pence agrees to send it back. Mike Pence has to agree to send it back.
Absolutely, they need to be paid more. You know, this is - you know, but if you look at it as a policy problem, you will quickly discover that, you know, this is one - this is a hard problem to solve because there's exactly one way you solve it, and that's you spend more money on it. You know, we need to spend more money on long-term care. This is something in this country we've never done. There's a whole complex set of reasons for that, a lot of it tied to who the people are who traditionally do this work, the fact that it's people who are easily discriminated against. But, yeah, we need to pay these people more. We need to pay these people a lot more.
You have a situation in a number of communities, including Wisconsin, just this past week where cities are barred from regulating the use of plastic bags. We're seeing it in a variety of measures, including the LGBTQ community that was affected most specifically in North Carolina. And so it's increasingly the tool of choice for some governors and some legislatures, particularly Republicans - in fact, almost entirely Republicans, even though in South Dakota there was a governor there - a conservative governor - who rejected a similar bar on local communities taking action on restrooms.

Anecdotally, I can say that the overwhelming majority of the friends and acquaintances living back home, all over 25 years old, do not have jobs and/or are still living with their parents. And that around 20% of my small high school graduating class, me included, is now living abroad, and that five out of five of my cousins under 30 years old are not working in Italy at the moment. Friends have gone to the United Kingdom, Germany, Portugal, South Africa, and the United States, among many others. They're pursuing Phds, working as managers, servers, engineers, professors, chefs, and architects.
In Ham's opinion, yes, liberals have a cancel culture problem (and some liberals would counter that cancel culture doesn't exist). But with GOP members censuring one another, Ham believes the right now has a cancel culture problem, too. And furthermore, it translates to a numbers problem, if attacking one another means pushing away voters in a swing state like, say, Arizona.
MARTIN: Can you just give us a sense of the president's tone? I mean, was there enough certainty in this address last night to ease concerns of Americans who are concerned about their livelihoods because of the outbreak?
WU: I don't know that they have to play for the pardon but they have been and they've got to concentrate on what's ahead of them. They have to concentrate on Judge Jackson. But unquestionably, their public statements are sending a message loud and clear that they are still hoping for the pardon.
Price will oversee a $1 trillion agency, the largest budget of any Cabinet secretary. In addition to Obamacare, HHS administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs and oversees the National Institutes of Health, among other programs and agencies.
California Rep. Ro Khanna has led a House Democratic effort to pressure Vice President Harris, who also serves as the president of the Senate, to overturn that ruling. Harris, Biden and Senate Democratic leaders have made it clear that isn't happening. So, as the Senate prepares to vote on the massive spending bill later this week, the measure won't include an agenda item progressives have rallied and organized around for years — and that Biden campaigned on implementing.
Mark Pudlow, a spokesman for the union, argues that the fund violates Florida students' constitutional right to a uniform education. That's because schools that receive scholarship funds don't have to follow the state curriculum, don't have to participate in testing, don't have to hire certified teachers. They don't have to follow the same rules.
It was likely his financial troubles and political humiliation led him to undertake one of the ghastliest series of crimes in American history. Kehoe rigged explosives in the basement of the town's school, and most of them went off on the morning of May 18, 1927. Schechter describes the heartbreaking aftermath of the bombing:

A single parent with $50,000 in earnings, three school-age children and no child care costs would also face a tax increase of around $1,188.
But it's scary. And you know, a lot of my colleagues - a lot of my nurses and doctors I work with, techs, the people that clean the rooms - everyone from top to bottom has been making sacrifices. And it's tough because we don't know - we really don't know when this virus is going to burn itself out. I mean, I feel like we're in the sprint phase right now. And we're going to be moving into the marathon phase relatively soon. And I think it's going to - above all, I think it's going to tax our resiliency as health care workers, you know, especially lacking the, you know, support systems we're used to at home.
EVANS: Yeah, and this is a sort of real-time example of why it's been so important for the state to focus on these racial equity issues. Another enforcement issue that advocates are worried about is that both bills would create a new open container law for possessing marijuana in a vehicle. They say this tool will be used to keep targeting Black people. And they say it's already illegal to drive under the influence of marijuana, so why create this new punishment? Chelsea Higgs Wise is a local activist here in Richmond, and she heads up the organization Marijuana Justice.
Despite its increased use during the pandemic, the appeals process is a black box from a transparency perspective, explains Abigail Seldin, who helped create SwiftStudent. The U.S. Department of Education doesn't collect data from colleges showing how much additional aid is given, which students appeal or which students are funded after submitting a request. In a recent op-ed in Inside Higher Ed, researchers from the Education Trust say this lack of transparency raises questions about how subjective and susceptible to bias professional judgments might be.
And that idea is bound to get some people very angry in a country that deeply prizes free speech but does not agree on what free speech means.

In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map. Libya was stable. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing and really a big big reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was somewhat under control. After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the entire world. Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. Iraq is in chaos. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis, now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before. This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness. But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy.
Remember, this is not a job he wanted. He was seen as the only one who could get the votes to become speaker after John Boehner resigned. It has certainly been rumored that Ryan is considering resigning — and it makes some sense. At this point, it's just speculation, but worth watching.

Health experts warned that many states and localities were moving too quickly to open safely. Coronavirus cases soon began to skyrocket in much of the country, particularly in the South and West. By early August the pandemic had entered what health officials called a new phase, with cases widespread in rural as well as metro areas. In the fall, Midwest states have seen some of the most severe case counts and deaths.

The phrase is so pervasive that it's arguably background noise in American politics now — just part of the wallpaper, a pair of words you might easily (or, depending on your feelings, happily) breeze past every day without paying it any attention.
That's what some landlords in Newburgh, like Michael Acevedo, predict will happen. You go into business to make money, right? I don't do it for my health. I do it to pay my bills, Acevedo says.
Trump alluded to his call to fire NFL players who kneel during the national anthem. Many saw those remarks at the time as racially charged, given that most of the athletes taking a knee as a silent protest were black players seeking to protest police brutality particularly affecting African-American communities. But Trump's efforts last year to spotlight the kneeling protests have been a popular play with his conservative base.
COVID-19: 'We Can Push This Virus Back,' WHO Leader Says Of Coronavirus
At the Jan. 6 rally, Trump and his son, Don Jr., went even further, threatening a primary election defeat for any Republican who failed to back Trump's effort to have Congress overturn President-elect Joe Biden's election.
Coronavirus was a main focus of discussion among G20 finance ministers, who held a previously scheduled meeting over the weekend in Saudi Arabia. In a communique, the finance ministers promised to monitor the outbreak, along with other risks to the global economy, and said they are prepared to take additional action as necessary.

But there are some signs of progress: This year, a new dengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years. And the world is more prepared to deal with Ebola than at any time in history: Two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use, all developed after the 2014 West Africa outbreak. The current Ebola outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world's ability to battle this virus. If there's an Ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020, it would likely be contained and crushed quickly. — Jason Beaubien
People don't understand what it means that $400 million disappeared. We need to translate those numbers to the common man. How many people would have been treated for HIV? The treatment is about $100 a year, per person. For $400 million, that's a lot of people you can put on treatment.

Biden has said he supports increasing the minimum wage, but is doubtful it can be passed through the Senate reconciliation process that only needs 51 votes.
If nothing else, the additional time it took to rework the bill has allowed Pettersen to be back from her one-month maternity leave in time for debate on the bill. The Democrats hold a slim 19-16 margin in the Senate and cannot count on a strict party-line vote, because some party members are wavering in their support for the new approach.
She's a nurse, so I lucked out, Pineau-Chaisson says.
What's more, Trump's stance on the uprising is more in line with an interventionist approach, which is contradictory to his more isolationist America First policy. So there is a question about the Trump Doctrine: When does the United States intervene and when does it not? What is the trigger to say, OK, this is where the United States gets involved?
SELYUKH: The quiet. She lives in the French Quarter of New Orleans. This time of year, it would be raucous crowds shuttling back and forth, sounds of music drifting into the streets - now all quarantined, shut down, holed up at home.
Pointing out 12-year-old Preston Sharp, attending the speech as Trump's guest, who had taken it upon himself to put flags on veterans' graves, Trump used the opportunity to call for more adherence to our civic duty as Americans.

GOP lawmakers also have objections to the scope of the paid family leave benefits. Eligible workers, including people who would not be paid if they miss a day of work, would receive the benefit if they have to miss 14 or more days in a month because of the virus. It would apply to people with a coronavirus diagnosis, people who must self-quarantine, people caring for another person with coronavirus and people who must stay home because of school and child care closings.
BERNIE SANDERS: Mr. Bloomberg had policies in New York City of stop-and-frisk, which went after African American and Latino people in an outrageous way. That is not a way you're going to grow voter turnout.

FURMAN: I've always thought that was a bit of a problem. The statistic that I care about most in the economy - the two statistics - are median household income and the poverty rate. And we report those once a year because we only get them once a year. We get the S&P every minute of every day, and we hear it all the time. And I think that leads people to focus a little bit too much on these gyrations in the market minute to minute and a little bit too little on the underlying trend for incomes in the economy.
Those ideas are the core of what Republicans say they want to do to replace the ACA, but the details of how big the tax credits would be and exactly how the HSAs would be structured are unknown.
Senate Passes Bipartisan Relief Package Amid COVID-19 Economic Downturn
Staffers received an email late last month from campaign human resources, letting them know that a fund had been established to cover the cost of health insurance through April.
We have to change our ways, Trump said. We can no longer be the stupid country. We want to be the smart country.
The two exceptions are the U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, and the U.S. attorney for Connecticut, John Durham. The news was first reported by CNN.

And so the Congressional Black Caucus was extended an invitation for all 49 of our members to go to the White House. We chose to just send the leadership. We took the time to write a 125-page document that basically said, this is what we have to lose. Each of us made a presentation on a substantive area of policy. Mine was criminal justice. And basically, he wasn't really able to have a dialogue. We do think he paid attention. I just don't think that there was any there there to actually have a dialogue with us. And then he also made it clear just a few days ago what he thinks about the Congressional Black Caucus. When the Democratic senators mentioned that the CBC would be upset at the immigration proposal, he basically said he had no interest in what the Congressional Black Caucus said.
As we rebuild America's strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad, Trump said. Around the world, we race rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values, he said.
Meanwhile, there are a lot of savings out there looking for a return, and there don't seem to be enough investment opportunities to sop it all up. As we explained in last week's Planet Money newsletter, a shortage of investment relative to a glut of savings is why we're now in the upside-down world of super-low interest rates.
But with just a two-vote margin in the Senate, they can't ignore Republican senators. So it was notable when Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton tweeted that the House bill won't be able to win a Senate majority. To my friends in House: pause, start over. Get it right, don't get it fast.
The official said details about tax cuts and entitlement programs, including Social Security and Medicare, will come later. The administration is not expected to propose changes to entitlements.
HORSLEY: The risks of a recession have certainly increased. Before the coronavirus outbreak, most economists were not predicting a recession in the U.S. in 2020. And now there are some prominent forecasters who say it's more likely than not. But there's still a lot of uncertainty. And the wild swings you see in the stock market just reflect the uncertainty investors have as they try to suss out what path this is going to take.
And the reason being is many of the programs at USDA are designed to benefit those who produce. And if your loan wasn't granted on time, if your interest rate was higher, if you didn't get a loan, then you couldn't necessarily keep up with your neighbor in terms of production. You weren't able to buy the newest equipment. You weren't able to get the best seed. You weren't able to buy the farm next to you to be able to expand your operation. So over a period of time, a system that basically rewards production created a gap between those who were advantaged and those who were socially disadvantaged.

ROBERTS: It totally affects it because what the Republicans in the Senate are saying when they're looking at these disaffected voters from the Republican leadership, is to say look, it really does make a difference to have a Republican Senate. We can stop this nominee, and we can stop liberal nominees. And so it's very, very important to you voters to have a Republican Senate. And that is a big part of the campaign they're running on.
Blagojevich, Trump said in 2018, was convicted for being stupid, saying things that every other politician, you know, that many other politicians say.
So in all of the ways that he differs from previous presidents, I think the most significant one is that he doesn't see his role as a unifier. That's something that all previous presidents have. His modus operandi really is division, which worked for him during the campaign. And he believes it still does. Just to give you an example, in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, 57 percent of Americans said that race relations have gotten worse under President Trump, compared to 37 percent who said the same thing about President Obama.

But while some are giving the movement credit for a few political victories, notably Republican Scott Brown's capturing the Senate seat Democrat Ted Kennedy held for decades, not all is sweet for the Tea Party.
MOORE: Now, Mr. Trump has not signed off on these yet. I hope that he does. But one of them would be to just put a cap on the amount of deductions and loopholes that people could take advantage of. So for example, just to throw out a number, we're saying, OK, what if you cap the deductions at 50,000. So for the middle class, that's not going to affect them at all 'cause most - a lot of American's don't even make $50,000 of income.

There is a groundswell for Congress to act to change gun laws, reform health insurance and protect DREAMers, who were brought to the U.S. as children illegally. Health insurance is the biggest priority Americans want their legislators to address, with 72 percent saying Congress should take immediate action on it. There's some rare bipartisan agreement here too, with 73 percent of Democrats, 66 percent of Republicans and 73 percent of independents all wanting Congress to immediately address the issue.
SIMON: Watergate, of course, occasioned hearings - public hearings. We haven't had them yet here.

It didn't stop there. When Sen. Cory Booker was asked about the current state of the immigration crisis on the southern border, he voiced his displeasure with the Trump administration's policies in Spanish, too. Thursday night's debate is likely to bring up even more of these moments (cue Tío Joe).
It would be implemented through the Child Care and Development Block Grant program, which in the past two years saw its funding significantly boosted by Congress in spending bills ultimately signed by President Trump. A White House official, who declined to speak on the record because the budget is not yet public, said the president's 2020 budget proposal calls for spending $5.3 billion on the program, the same level that Congress set aside in 2019 and a big increase over what past Trump administration budgets asked for. The $1 billion one-time fund would come on top of that.

Congress voted last month to extend emergency unemployment benefits through March and boost those benefits by $300 per week. Biden's plan would increase the additional benefits to $400 per week, and extend them through September, or longer if economic conditions warrant.
GROSS: It's going real slowly, isn't it?
On his first full day as president, Trump went to the CIA to try to mend fences with the intelligence agency he repeatedly maligned during the campaign and the transition. (He blamed the media for creating the feud, but his own tweets disprove that.) While standing before a memorial at the agency, he argued over the crowd size at his inauguration, making false assertions that run counter to aerial photos of the event and NPR's own reporters on the ground. He also claimed it stopped raining during his inaugural address, when it did not.

One year later, I'm proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria. But there is much more work to be done. We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated.
Miringoff noted that in the 18 polls Marist has conducted since Trump was inaugurated, his approval rating has been somewhere between 35 and 42 percent — not an encouraging sign for an incumbent president ahead of his first midterm, when the president's party typically loses seats.

And you did say allowing that narrative to take hold was the single most avoidable mistake you made as speaker, right?

Sam Brownback cut taxes dramatically in Kansas. As a Republican governor of a Republican state, he was going to enact the dream. Taxes on small businesses went down to zero.

Democrats and Republicans have flirted with the idea of getting rid of the filibuster for legislation for years.
In his view, that means the amount of renewable natural gas that's genuinely sustainable is even smaller than the industry estimates. And there's a limit to how much hydrogen you can use in metal pipes without causing damage, Saadat says. Research suggests pipes and appliances would need to be replaced to handle a gas blend of more than about 20% hydrogen.
Trump Won. The Media Lost. What Next?
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I've never liked him much - hasn't been for me. I've really - probably never will.
Responding to a question about whether the president would be amenable to steps backed by Pelosi, including an extension of unemployment insurance, McConnell said: I think the package needs to be negotiated. I think the speaker is obviously the most prominent Democrat here on Capitol Hill, and anything to get on the president's desk has to be agreed to between the administration and the speaker of the House.
In addition to the paid leave programs, the legislation would provide $500 million for low-income women, mothers with young children and pregnant women who lose jobs due to the virus, $400 million for food banks and flexibility for state-run programs.
Nine days after the State of the Union speech, Congress approved a bipartisan spending bill that gave Trump around $1.3 billion in border security funding, short of the $5.7 billion he had asked for. Trump signed the bill to avoid a partial government shutdown but moved to declare a national emergency in order to free up military construction funding for the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
PAVIOUR: Well, racial disparities were not a focus for the states that legalized early on, and so wealth in the industry flowed to mostly white entrepreneurs and investors. One 2017 survey found that over 80% of marijuana business owners and founders are white. So some states have tried to address the issue in different ways. In New Jersey, they're directing 70% of tax revenues to go toward communities impacted by the war on drugs, which compared to 30% in Virginia. In Illinois, they've tried to set up a special category of so-called social equity licenses. But so far, the state doesn't have a single majority-Black-owned dispensary.
Small moments of joy have been stolen from avid animal-live-cam watchers who regularly check up on their favorites at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C. According to the zoo's website, the live animal cams require federal resources and funding, so they've gone dark during the shutdown
But Walsh said this trip makes clear that Trump does not plan to do so. And Walsh is concerned that Trump could make things worse by picking such a hot-button issue.
The House passed a similar version of the plan last month but had to approve changes to the legislation made by the Senate. One key difference is that the Senate's version of the bill doesn't include an increase to the minimum wage, a provision that was ruled out by the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian.
It's notable that this was the first time in this year of the coronavirus that there was a national moment focused on remembering the dead, as many Americans couldn't even be with loved ones who died in hospitals across the country and never had proper funerals.
Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses — many of them thousands of dollars per worker, Trump will say, according to excerpts.
And once you get past the slogans, you immediately discover all the trade-offs, all the parts of, you know, someone's going to feel some pain in order to give someone else some benefit. And they never did those - they never did that work. You know, there were a handful of intellectuals who had plans. There were a handful of members of Congress who had bills. But they really didn't focus on it all.
Democrats are delivering on our promise to take action to defeat this virus and provide the assistance the American people need until our economy can reopen safely and fully, the Maryland Democrat added.
DAVIES: I want to explore this. Your organization came up with this survey of business executives by the Luntz Global polling firm. That's Frank Luntz's firm. And it was done for the Council of State Chambers, right? This is essentially a Council of State Chambers of Congress, is that right?
So why are teachers marching now in places where unions are weak? Simple, says Paglayan. They have much less to lose.
LIASSON: Well, it's possible this could be yet another short-lived reality TV-style moment for Trump like immigration and guns. But no one knows. Again, if he goes ahead with this, we'll see what happens, as Trump likes to say, because the American economy is going to be the guinea pig used in this experiment.
Sahhar and her husband don't plan to retire. I expect to work until I'm dead.
Why Do Russian Journalists Keep Falling?
You know, I just have to say, I mean, this was so preposterous that we'd be talking about this a couple of years ago, that it's a reminder of how much politics have changed and been changed by the candidacy of Donald Trump. Now, look, how that actually translates into a White House, we don't yet know. But Steve Bannon is now a couple of steps from the Oval Office, and that's - we're in uncharted territory there.
Critics of the emerging tax bill say it gives huge benefits to the wealthy and corporations and doesn't do much for the working class. But advocates like Yentel say it could be much worse than that when it comes to affordable housing — a lot of working families, people on lower incomes and the elderly would lose out on the chance to get a place they could afford to live.
[Warren was originally a favorite to be head of the CFPB, but the Obama administration decided to go with Cordray. The New York Times reported at the time that Warren had failed to win over the president or Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, in part because of her independent streak and her outspokenness, which at times put her at odds with the administration. — Danielle Kurtzleben [Warren was tapped by the White House while she was still a professor at Harvard as a special adviser to the president setting up the agency. — Tamara Keith]
House Passes $1.9 Trillion COVID-19 Plan; Biden Calls For 'Quick Action' From Senate
We believe that the stakes here in New York are dramatic — for consumers, for our health care delivery system and for our state budget as well, says Donna Frescatore, executive director of NY State of Health, New York's marketplace.
One of Trump's most reality-show-inspired moments underscored the challenge he faces with African American voters. In the middle of his address, Trump gave the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to Rush Limbaugh, a conservative talk radio host whom many African Americans view with suspicion because of his past comments on race, including disparaging remarks about former President Barack Obama.
The country has been watching and protesting with anger as Republicans are now days away from passing their backdoor deal that digs into the pockets of the middle class to pay for massive tax breaks for multinational corporations, said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.
HORSLEY: It is unusual. One watchdog group has called this the most ethically challenged administration ever. This is, remember, the wealthiest Cabinet ever. And there were a lot of financial entanglements. But many of those who've fallen under scrutiny are not the billionaire businesspeople but rather folks who have some experience in government.
MCCAMMON: He went on to call Trump out on recent controversial statements he's made.
The Call-In: Teaching And School Funding
The legislation seeks to make testing for the coronavirus free to the public (without having to use deductibles or copayments). It includes a variety of waivers in order for testing costs to be covered by either insurance or government programs.
Bloomberg also offered something else: a job through the general election, even if he was not the Democratic Party's nominee. Jethwani signed on as a regional organizing director. As part of his job, he interviewed potential field staffers, giving them the same assurances. That employment is guaranteed through November, location is not, Jethwani said.
FORD: ...By these presents do grant a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon.
It's a little bit like gun control, said political analyst William Galston of the Brookings Institution. You have a pretty solid popular majority in favor [of trade agreements]. But the people who can be mobilized on the basis of that single issue are disproportionately on one side.
SHAPIRO: When you talk about job training and apprenticeships, that doesn't sound like saving manufacturing jobs, preventing them from leaving. That sounds like moving the U.S. economy into the next phase - whatever it is - beyond manufacturing.

The executive director of the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police released a statement calling the measure anti-police. Ed Wojcicki says it unfairly targets officers and attempts to punish them, not just make them accountable.
MARTIN: So criticizing Amy Klobuchar's health care plan as well. What does that tell us about the overall condition of her presidential bid?
Recently, at a campaign event, Hillary Clinton short-circuited - you know this, you've heard this one - Hillary Clinton short-circuited again – to use a now famous term – when she accidentally told the truth and said she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class.
There is no reason to doubt that this was one of Ryan's goals. Helping the middle class is the lodestar for politicians in both parties. Ryan rarely misses a chance to note his roots in blue-collar Janesville, Wis., and the bill does reduce tax rates for the middle class.
NPR journalists recuse themselves from covering stories or events related to their family members' political activities. We may go so far as to change job responsibilities (for instance, moving off the politics desk to an area of coverage well removed from that subject). You have the right to marry anyone you want, but you don't have the right to cover any beat you want if the potential conflicts appear to be too great, as Tom Rosenstiel of Pew's Project for Excellence in Journalism said to the Los Angeles Times.
Hutchinson, vice chair of the National Governors Association, said his state has already patched its pandemic budget gap, its economy is booming and Arkansas doesn't need the additional help that Biden's rescue plan would offer.
KING: NPR's Lucian Kim is in Moscow. Hey, Lucian.
Critics of school choice say the programs funnel money and students away from public schools.
ZARROLI: Today, regulators in a number of countries - including India, France, Sweden and the United States - said they would look into the documents released.
But as of Thursday afternoon, Pallone still couldn't get his hands on a copy.
Corker's concern was the trillion dollars this bill's expected to add to the deficit or the federal debt. He didn't really win any concessions, but he ultimately came around, saying, this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make U.S. corporations more competitive.
The relationship between police and their treatment of African-Americans was a common topic this election year. Trump ran as the law and order candidate and he's sticking to it: He plans on increasing funding for federal law enforcement to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars. He also wants to provide more funding and training to local police departments.
This is our opportunity to help Coloradans. And we're going through it, even in our workplace, says Pettersen, who took one month of paid leave from her legislative work. (Colorado legislators are allowed to take up to 40 days of fully compensated leave, but their salary is reduced if they're out longer for anything other than a medical illness.)
President Trump is considering a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico as a way to pay for the wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. That means American consumers would end up footing much of the bill.
Joe Biden swung back at that — his deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, in a statement said that Harris' plan represented a refusal to be straight with the American middle class, adding that they believed her plan would mean middle-class tax hikes.
Her lab tests (vitamin D, CBC, fasting blood glucose, comprehensive metabolic panel, hemoglobin A1-C, vitamin B-12) were all described as normal by her physician. Her cholesterol was normal at 189, LDL at 103, HDL at 56, though her triglycerides were somewhat elevated at 159.
COSTA: He does not come out of the Republican political class. He has very few allies in Washington. He has not been in the trenches in the GOP for years, and so people are uncomfortable with him. They're not sure if they can trust him. But there's also a sense, now, that it has struck some kind of chord with the Republican base that has grown very weary with the elected leadership in Washington.
You know, it's like a gut punch to millions of people, recalled Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, who chairs the House Progressive Caucus. Because he came out so bold on including $15. And then suddenly to preempt made no sense to us.
Oil prices, which can reflect economic demand, have also been volatile after Saudi Arabia unexpectedly decided to slash its prices for crude last weekend. The price of oil fell 3.6% Wednesday. It has dropped 29% over the past five trading days.
Trump Takes A Last Look At His Border Wall As Congress Considers Impeachment
Steve Inskeep talks to Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, about President Trump's economic report. NPR's Scott Horsley weighs in on the conversation.
Editor's note: This is an excerpt of Planet Money's newsletter. You can sign up here.
The Trump administration is proposing an $850 billion stimulus package to help struggling businesses and individuals weather the economic slowdown triggered by the coronavirus.
OCASIO-CORTEZ: Absolutely. Because we're creating jobs.
Hill wants to see more investment into research and development of better birth control. Hormonal birth control influences the brain in ways that make people uncomfortable to acknowledge, she says, including whom a woman finds attractive as a mate and, to some degree, how she responds to stress.
Mixed in with this nativism, many in the GOP base now believe misinformation and have declining trust in expertise and institutions.
CAROLYN ADOLPH, BYLINE: A thousand people move to Seattle every week, many for tech jobs. That's driven the cost of housing up. And homelessness has exploded. Seattle has 400 homeless encampments in the city at any time.

[Trump's proposed income tax deduction on the average cost of childcare was criticized for likely being more of a help to higher-income families than to many working-class families. However, the Trump campaign has also said that it will allow lower-income families to deduct the cost of childcare from their payroll taxes. The campaign says it will offer more details in coming weeks on their childcare plans. — Danielle Kurtzleben]
Prior to Trump arriving in office, California and 13 other states pioneered their own tougher standards on tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks. The states' authority to have their own rules hinges on California's waiver, special permission granted 40 years ago by the federal government for the state to set separate car pollution standards. Trump sought to revoke California's waiver, which the state challenged as being illegal under the Clean Air Act.
Trump has been vocal about school choice, which allows parents to choose to send their child to any type of school: traditional public, private or charter. Critics say school choice leads to a gap in equitable school investment. Proponents say it increases competition between schools. In addition to school choice, Trump wants to end the Common Core standards, which are the federal guidelines created for K-12 education across the country. States were able to choose to opt in (some didn't) — and the federal government encouraged it.
One day after the House advanced President Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package, Vice President Harris championed the proposed round of aid as much needed help for Black Americans, calling the pandemic an accelerator for the fissures and the failures, the defects, the flaws in our system.

KEITH: Now, of course, Biden has accepted their request for an invite to the White House. The meeting will happen at 5 p.m. today. But there's a sense more broadly from Republicans on the Hill that beyond that, they just want Biden to come to them, not the other way around. In their letter, the 10 senators note that all other COVID relief measures have passed on a bipartisan basis and say that it would be better to do it that way this time as well.

The Florida Rights Restoration Coalition is accepting online applications from people who want to see whether they are able to receive help in the participating counties to get their voting rights restored.
During the Trump administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture researchers published and funded objective analyses of issues such as climate change, the efficiency of food assistance programs, and tax cuts that mostly benefit the richest farmers. It wasn't received well.
SIMON: Look, the truth of the matter is that we are in a terrible election right now. We have one man who's a hothead against a woman who's probably criminal. I mean, it's - it's a very bad - it's an awful situation for our country. It really is. However, I - what I would rather see is a real, serious discussion of the issues.
RASCOE: But she didn't say that explicitly, though. And I was struck by how they were trying to get her on that point, and she just wouldn't say she wouldn't say that...
Dodson says the problem is grave, but that President Biden's nominee for secretary of agriculture, Tom Vilsack, could quickly make a dent in it.
Even if the legal issues are cleared away, Biden has repeatedly said he prefers to take action through Congress. He has also thrown his support behind other efforts to tame the federal student loan beast, including income-driven repayment plans and making college more affordable.
With the constant repetition of the phrase cancel culture, the idea of cancellation has strayed from what it once stood for.
The way Romney characterized those who don't pay federal income taxes is what got him in trouble, but the figure was roughly true. The new poll, however, shows that a majority think that the share of Americans paying no federal income tax is far lower.
For companies the size of Dark City, the tax break's savings would have a disproportionately big impact, according to the Brewers Association. We think the vast majority of this benefit accrues to the smallest brewers in the country, Watson said.
There will be no change under Hillary Clinton – only four more years of Obama. But we are going to look boldly into the future. We will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, sea ports and airports that our country deserves. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will connect our cities, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring. We will put new American metal into the spine of this nation. It will be American hands that rebuild this country, and it will be American energy - mined from American sources - that powers this country. It will be American workers who are hired to do the job.
After the pain of World War II, Britons decided to provide health care for all, and they're still very proud and protective of that choice, says Roberta Bivins, a historian of medicine at the University of Warwick.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said Friday that he will not seek reelection for a fourth term that would begin next January. He has been investigating former President Donald Trump's finances, and the Supreme Court last month cleared the way for the prosecutor's office to receive Trump's tax returns and other financial records.
Trump would also have the power to deport more than 2 million criminals in the country illegally, halt immigration from parts of the world he calls terror prone, and quickly reverse many of the initiatives undertaken by President Obama.
By Linton's apparent logic, the absolute dollar amounts are what matter — 40 cents is bigger than 10 cents.
You know they wanted to get rid of the Jefferson Memorial. Either take it down or just put somebody else in there. I don't think that's going to happen. It damn well better not. Although, with this administration, if this happens, it could happen. You'll see some really bad things happen.
[It is true, according to the most recent data, that less than half of Detroiters have a job, but this figure includes small children and retirees. The 'employment-population ratio,' as calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed that 43.9 percent of Detroiters had a job in 2014, while 59 percent of people in the United States had a job the same year. A more often cited statistic, which removes people younger than 16 from the calculus, is the 'participation rate.' It was 53.4 percent in Detroit and 62.9 percent for the United States. -Will Huntsberry]
For one thing, they could write the full value of the equipment off their taxes right away.

My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this, and to see me, tonight.
The ruling by the parliamentarian was not released publicly, and progressives immediately blasted it. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said members told constituents they would push to pass a bill to increase wages, and we can't tell them this didn't get one because of an unelected parliamentarian. She and other liberal Democrats vowed to mount a fight, or even try to oust the parliamentarian. Senate Democratic leaders and the White House indicated they would respect the ruling but continue to look to get the increase through another legislative route.
(Note: Ocasio-Cortez's office released an updated version of the bill on Thursday. The earlier version, which we had included in a prior version of this story, is still available here.)
That these changes paved a way for fraud on a scale never seen before. I think we go a long way outside of our country when I say that.

California Attorney General Becerra said in a statement after Tuesday's decision:
In other words, the bigger the better when the country is in crisis. And if Republicans want to get on board with that, in Biden's view, great. If not, he says, it's an easy choice.

It's a big lift to get it to move in this Congress, she says. But I think it's important to roll it out and it's important to have a discussion about it.
GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Well, you know, this is a health care system that's stretched very thin right now. The only thing that's still open on this island for health care are hospitals. Doctors' offices and walk-in clinics are all closed, and they're starting to see a rise in storm-related cases here, things like accidents but also things like respiratory problems and people who haven't treated their diabetes because they can't keep their insulin refrigerated.
In that usage, cancel refers to a pretty unremarkable concept, says Nicole Holliday, assistant professor of linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania.
Some likely trends give cause for optimism — signs of progress in solving the world's problems. Other trends are pessimistic — threats and challenges that are expected to worsen in the year ahead.

We're going to stay on the subject of politics and policy for a few more minutes by continuing our look at the people setting the priorities in the new Senate. Recently, we took a look at Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell, who led the Senate's Republican majority for years and was a key player in enacting the former president's agenda, pushing through tax cuts and filling the federal courts with like-minded judges. Today, we want to hear about the new majority leader, New York Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer. Schumer gained control of the Senate this January after a pair of upset wins in the Georgia runoffs handed the Democrats a slim majority in the Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote. It was a big moment for Schumer, who's had his sights set on the position for years after falling short in 2016.
GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with Lisa Graves, executive director of The Center for Media and Democracy. We'll hear more after a break. Also rock critic Ken Tucker will review the new album by singer and songwriter Robbie Fulks. And John Powers will review a new dramatic film that he says takes you places and shows you things you haven't seen before. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.
The Clinton Foundation very much mirrors former President Bill Clinton's public image. It is ambitious. It is sprawling and, at times, unfocused. Its practices raise many ethical red flags that political observers say could have easily been avoided. And yet it has also delivered concrete results in public policy fields as wide-ranging as lowering the price of HIV/AIDS medication in sub-Saharan Africa to combating childhood obesity.
Pallone said he was pushing to get a copy of the most recent draft of the bill because he had heard Walden intends to have the committee vote on it next Wednesday — a timeline that wouldn't give the Democrats and the public much time to analyze the legislation.
As for the program to distribute pads in schools, it hasn't been nearly as effective as hoped, Mukuria adds, because there's no structure in place to track what happens to the pads — or make sure they get to girls at all.
For years, if not decades, economists have insisted it is imperative for Iraq to have a more diverse economy and a larger private sector, so that so many people's livelihoods do not depend on a high oil price. But despite international development initiatives large and small, the private sector is still dwarfed by the state economy.
Natural Gas Companies Have Their Own Plans To Go Low-Carbon
And now, with the 2020 filing season underway, the agency has new responsibilities. It needs to issue the latest stimulus payments to some 85% of American households, according to President Biden, and implement other provisions as well.
A repeal of the Affordable Care Act, without significant replacement, could cost 2.7 million New Yorkers their health insurance and the state $3.7 billion, according to Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office.
We may not be as wrapped up in the case as people in Northern Virginia — where politics is the biggest local industry — but is there really a registered voter in Southwest Virginia who has not heard of Manafort's indictment and special counsel Robert Mueller's larger investigation? the editors asked.
So, this is a very different Republican Party than it was decades ago. Gone are the concerns of free trade and a hawkish national security with a strong American global footprint. In is a type of right-wing populism with voters animated by cultural issues like immigration, abortion and religious freedom — things the base perceives as necessary to defend to maintain a way of life that liberal popular culture threatens.
'We Simply Can't Take It Any Longer': Teacher Protests Sweep Arizona, Colorado
The Trump administration made the revelation after copies of the tax returns anonymously were put in the mailbox of journalist David Cay Johnston.
The administration in Baghdad was poorly done. As you remember, there was - General Garner was there, and he was out, and then Bremer came in. Mr. Wolfowitz said that we would pay for the war in Iraq with Iraqi oil revenues. When the first insurgents - oh, when the looting started, Secretary Rumsfeld said, stuff happens. And then when the insurgency started, he said there was a few dead-enders. The reason why I mention that, there was a gross mis - underestimation of the challenge we faced in the post-conflict aspect of Iraq.
DIONNE: Good to be with you.
Trump also controls much of the conservative political apparatus in the country, with the Republican National Committee firmly within his grip.
The 1935 Social Security Act included the Aid to Dependent Children program (later renamed Aid to Families with Dependent Children), which again primarily directed aid to single mothers. Benefits remained small, and government caseworkers sometimes intruded into families' private lives.

Biden tried to show a semblance of normalcy, walking out of the presidential limo to the White House, but it was heavily curtailed. There were some people along the walk, but not the throngs of crowds lining the streets from past inaugurations.
And at that point then, it would come down to the question of whether the United States would seek to try to salvage NATO and protect it or whether it would abandon it entirely, which if it did so would be the end of basically 70 years of American national security strategy in Europe.
Mishory points out the GOP proposal to roll back Medicaid expansion could hurt some young, single adults. The proposed tax credit might help others.
Included in the legislation is one tightly packed sentence that says the government's appointed student loan commissioner (there was no education secretary back then) shall have the power to agree to modifications of agreements or loans made under this title and to compromise, waive, or release any right, title, claim, or demand, however arising or acquired under this title.
WEAVER: Even if you look at the candidates who were not the most progressive in the race, you are seeing candidates who are much more progressive than the quote, unquote, center of last time. Conor Lamb ran unabashedly against the Republican tax plan. You know, Democratic centrists of past eras would have run in favor of that plan. You know, the nominee in - for governor of Michigan is for a $15 minimum wage. So what you're seeing is that the party itself, the whole center of gravity in the party has moved in a more progressive direction. And I think we will come out a stronger, more united party that is capable not only of competing with Trump but in defeating him in 2020.
They're saying they would potentially vote for witnesses, like, say, former national security adviser John Bolton, to come and testify. But they want to do it after the White House and the House have presented their case to the Senate and the senators have presented their arguments. And that's something that could take weeks. So we may see this witness fight play out more than once in the Senate trial.

An infrastructure bill by early summer
STONE: Yes, people - the 200,000 people in the marketplace, many of whom can now afford insurance with the tax credits. And then 400,000 plus people in Arizona benefited from Medicaid expansion. And that was the big concern here when - as the Republicans moved to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.
We've written before in the Planet Money newsletter about growing evidence that our welfare programs may not be up to the task. A study last year by the California Policy Lab found evidence that a huge percentage of poverty-stricken Californians are not getting the Earned Income Tax Credit because of the difficulty of filling out tax forms. Mullainathan and his colleagues' work is a reminder that policymakers should recognize the cognitive burden on many of those who live in poverty and make it easier for them to get assistance.
DONOVAN: We haven't seen all of it. There was an amendment that was dropped by a member of the Freedom Caucus and a member of the more moderate Tuesday Group on Thursday.

We expend a lot of money. We're investing everything. We're investing in time for life here, getting degrees and trying to do the right thing. So we feel very injustice.
Pompeo will soon be out of his job. And it's expected Pack will be replaced promptly as well.

Our World in Data, an online publication based at Oxford University, also expects the number of people around the world with higher-education degrees to increase as advanced skills become more important in both developing and developed economies.

Although the improvement isn't in every country, Green says the rise in the global average is still a striking win. — Joanne Lu
GRAVES: That's correct. That's correct. That's what we're seeing in a lot of places. You have very progressive cities and you can see that play out in both the local elections for mayor, in many instances, as well as in the races for Congress and in the presidential races when you look at the big map of where it's blue and where it's red.
Trump also said he would take emergency action to provide financial relief to people who need to stay home because they are sick or quarantined or are caring for others. There were no details immediately available on that measure.

With a GOP administration in place for the first time in eight years, congressional leaders have mapped out an ambitious legislative agenda, with goals to have bills to repeal and replace Obamacare, overhaul the tax code and build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, all before lawmakers break for the annual August recess.
KING: What exactly is ailing us? He talked about the rate of infection. Obviously only doctors can do something about that - right? - the medical community. It won't, he said, fix a broken supply chain. And that seems to be at the heart of this. Can you explain what's going on there?

If [families are] putting money in one month and taking it out the next, they don't really have that advantage of long-term investing, Frerichs says. And it's really just using them to get around state taxes.

Harris draws directly on her personal experiences in California in explaining her approach to immigration. Her focus contrasts with the criminality often emphasized by President Trump. She told NPR, for example, about children she met on a bus in Marietta, Calif. — unaccompanied minors who had been sent by their parents away from high-crime areas in Central America, who were being exposed to unknown perils, [but] their parents decided that was better than them staying where they were. So that tells you how bad it was where they were.
This is easy enough to fact-check — at least, the first part is. It's not at all true that nobody ever saw anything being built. Stimulus projects were often well-advertised, with construction areas marked by large signs proclaiming that those sites were funded by the stimulus.
TUBBS: I would disagree. But I also think as a human being, there are some things that you don't earn. Some things are rights. And I do think that people deserve a basic economic floor so the bottom doesn't fall out under them. People working 14-hour days, working incredibly hard and being rewarded with wages that haven't kept up with the cost of inflation over the past two generations, that's problematic for me as well. So I definitely believe in the work ethic of working. And I don't think $500 a month, according to the research and evidence from other trials done over the past three decades, will make it so that people won't work.

For her part, Ocasio-Cortez says that a policy like the Green New Deal could get voters excited enough to pressure their Congress members to support it.
Yeah, that miracle is the tax overhaul plan that the president unveiled just yesterday. It'll fall to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to determine a lot of the specifics and also to try to sell it to other lawmakers - so a lot to unpack about what could be in store for taxpayers.

In a second plank, Trump calls for the sale of health insurance plans across state lines to bolster competition by increasing the number of policies being sold. Health insurance is regulated largely at the state level. And critics of the multistate approach, a favorite of the GOP for years, say it would erode consumer protections.
News Brief: Accusations Against Franken, House Tax Overhaul Win
DIONNE: Yeah, I shuddered at the thought of Trump as a father figure wondering, what kind of father is that with this roughness? I thought this was the old vinegar in a new bottle. He got a lot of credit he didn't deserve just because he showed he could spend one disciplined hour in relationship - in a relationship with the teleprompter, that what he was trying to do here is continue to scare the daylights out of the country to justify strong leadership and aggrandizing power. He talks about wide-open borders, gang members, drug dealers, criminals. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America.

So pouring in is not correct here, as is the assertion that we have no idea who they are. However, some experts have voiced concerns that the lack of American intelligence resources in Syria means, as Naylor reported, there's no way to compile a thorough watch list of possible terrorists from Syria against which refugees can be checked.

Health savings accounts will be able to pay for premiums. Under IRS rules, people with high-deductible plans are eligible for health savings accounts (HSAs), accounts into which people can put money for health care expenses tax-free. Under this bill, people would for the first time be able to use that money for premiums. Americans' deposits in HSAs have ballooned over the last decade, according to HSA consulting firm Devenir. However, those accounts also tend to benefit higher-income people more than others, as Kaiser Health News' Michelle Andrews wrote in December — for example, richer people are more likely to have the extra money to sock away for health expenses.

Remember; he is an associate of Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and Parnas was part of the campaign to pressure Ukraine's government to investigate the Bidens. In an interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow that aired last night, Parnas accused President Trump and a number of other high-ranking administration officials of direct involvement in the plot.
For people who don't qualify for premium tax credits, the picture is very different. The average monthly premium for 2018 was $522. That total was 28 percent higher than the previous year's total of $407, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities of CMS enrollment data.
On Nov. 29, 2012, dozens of fast-food workers assembled at a McDonald's in Midtown Manhattan to demand better pay. Their demonstration kicked off a massive wave of protests for a $15 minimum wage. Since then, cities and states around the U.S. have taken action. And now, the federal government, led by President Biden and a Democratic-controlled Congress, has begun to consider making the $15 minimum wage national.

The Republican tax overhaul plan has proven unpopular with voters. Just 26 percent of Americans approve of the plan, according to according to a poll released Monday by Monmouth University, compared with 47 percent who disapprove of it. (The poll was conducted before the joint conference committee released its final version.)
ESPUELAS: Well, I think Eduardo is a wonderful example of why the system is completely broken down. We have a reality in this country, which is that we need more immigrants in order for the economy to continue to grow. If magically today, you stopped all immigration into this country - documented, undocumented, whatever - our population would decline in the same way that the Japanese population is declining, the German population is declining. Our economy would come down. This is a fact. It's a demographic fact. What we don't have is a cogent system that we can actually apply in order to meet our needs as a country. And this is really a dynamic which has no party, has no ideology. It's just a need for the country.

Pennsylvania's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard contains two tiers. By 2021, companies have to purchase eight percent of their overall power from so-called tier 1 renewable energy sources — a list including wind farms, low-impact hydroelectric plants, and methane converted from landfills. A second tier of energy sources – including converted coal waste and larger hydroelectric projects – are to make up 10 percent of energy purchases by the end of the timeline. Solar power is in its own category, and tops out at half a percent.
And the measure would help people like Gutierrez who are vulnerable to the ACA's so-called family glitch. Her husband's $100 monthly premium for single coverage through his employer plan is considered affordable under the law because it costs less than 9.86 percent of their family's income of about $46,000 a year. That makes her ineligible for premium subsidies on the exchange, even though the $800 premium for the two of them through her husband's employer plan far exceeds that affordability percentage. Their three children already have Medicaid coverage.
Republicans say that lowering taxes will boost the economy and spur job creation. But critics say that the tax legislation would create an imbalance favoring machines over workers.
My dad was a small-business man. If his customers had done to him what Trump did to these companies, he wouldn't have made it, either.
OSNOS: Yeah. When you talk to a broad range of people who have been involved in the most sensitive national security questions, you know - these are the people who've been in the Situation Room at crucial moments particularly from Republican administrations what they'll tell you is that the crucial ingredient is whether or not a president is impetuous, whether or not the president makes decisions before they have as much information and as many competing points of view as possible. And often as one - James Woolsey who is a former director of the CIA is now an adviser to the Trump administration - before he became an adviser to Trump, he said to me in an interview that very often the first information that a president receives is wrong. And we've seen that beginning all the way from Vietnam up to the present day. And part of the sort of crucial patience that's required is the ability to both wait until you have a fuller picture and then also be prepared to act. But if you act on the basis of limited information, history suggests to us that we would have made a lot of catastrophic choices.
KHALID: So Sanders has been doing fairly well out West and - particularly in states that have large white liberal voting bases in the Democratic primaries or caucuses. He is expected to do pretty well in North Dakota, Washington state and Idaho. We've also got Mississippi and Missouri, both states that have sizable African American voting blocs. And Biden has shown that he has a particular strength with black voters. You know, Mississippi actually has a larger percentage of African American voters than South Carolina. So he's expected to do really particularly well in that state.
SANDERS: I regret the legislation that was on the floor. It was a bad piece of legislation. I don't regret voting to ban assault weapons. That's the promise that I made to the people of the state of Vermont.

The other big pot of money that funds the benefits in the health law comes from reductions in federal spending for Medicare (and to a lesser extent, Medicaid). Those include trims in the scheduled payments to hospitals, insurance companies and other health care providers, as well as increased premiums for higher-income Medicare beneficiaries.
But for Moore, it's hard to think about the overall national benefits, because he is worried about his own future. He hopes he doesn't get laid off. At 58, he is not sure where else he would go.
There's a variety of provisions in the legislation to offer support to different industries. The Small Business Administration will get $25 billion for a new grant program for restaurants and other food and drinking establishments. Grants will be up to $10 million per entity and $5 million per physical location, with a maximum of 20 locations. The legislation sets aside $5 billion of the total money to be targeted to businesses with less than $500,000 in revenue in 2019. The legislation includes another $1.25 billion for the Small Business Administration's Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program.

The Trump administration is very much in favor of showing prices to lower prices. In June, the president signed an executive order on price transparency.

And in November, the department issued a similar proposed rule for insurers.

I mean, why is it that so many members of Trump's team seem to have made misstatements under oath around this? Why is it that the president was so reluctant to make the Article 5 commitment that a Romanian journalist sort of dragged out of him today? It's very puzzling. It's, to me, troubling. But you saw that members of the committee are more interested in, you know, rehashing questions about Loretta Lynch, talking about leaks, things like that. I mean, that's all interesting, but the conduct of the president of the United States is fundamentally more significant.

Twenty-five thousand ballots in Pennsylvania were requested by nursing home residents, all in a single giant batch, not legal, indicating an enormous, illegal ballot harvesting operation. You're not allowed to do it, it's against the law.
JORDAN COTTON: Our first batch with the newly federally mandated hand sanitizer recipe.
FAHRENTHOLD: That's right. The IRS rules prohibit people who manage foundations for obvious reasons from using the charity's money to buy things for themself. So Trump appears to have violated that in at least two cases. One was in 2012. He was at a charity auction for the Susan G. Komen breast cancer charity. He paid $12,000 for a Tim Tebow football helmet, paid with the foundation's money.

If remdesivir is approved, Gilead's statement said, we are committed to making the medicine both accessible and affordable to governments and patients around the world.
The Manafort team, remember, wants to put Rick Gates on trial. They're blaming him for nearly all of Paul Manafort's troubles. But prosecutors introduced evidence today that Manafort was heavily involved in his own finances and that when it came to salaries, at least the ones that were reported to the bookkeepers, Rick Gates made about $240,000 a year and Paul Manafort made nearly 2 million, suggesting who really was in charge in that relationship.
The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service did not meet House Democrats' deadline to turn over President Trump's past tax returns by Wednesday, escalating what will likely culminate in a legal battle in the investigation into the president's personal and business finances.
We want people to come into our nation, he said, but we want people to love us and to love our values, not to hate us and to hate our values.

The longtime political operator who had advised presidents from Gerald Ford to Trump has been incarcerated since mid-June, when Judge Jackson ruled he posed a flight risk and a danger to the community.
The retailer Waitrose announced its new energy drink restrictions first, in early January. These drinks carry advice stating that they are not recommended for children, so we're choosing to proactively act on that guidance, particularly given the widespread concerns which have been raised about these drinks when consumed by under 16s, Simon Moore, Waitrose's director of corporate social responsibility, said in a statement. Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Lidl, Coop, Asda, Aldi and Tesco followed with their own bans on selling the drink to children, which will all roll out at the beginning of March.
Here's a look at six numbers that highlight the challenges Biden now faces:
I'm going to tell the head of Carrier: 'I hope you enjoy your stay in Mexico folks. But every single unit that you make and send across our border, which now will be real, you're going to pay a 35 percent tax,' Trump said at a campaign stop back in March.

MARTIN: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson was watching it all and joins us this morning. Hi, Mara.
COSTA: They do worry about that, especially when it comes to Trump's comments. Even those who think they could go around Trump and think that he could maybe bring in some new voters, they worry he's not become a disciplined candidate.
Republicans will have one other option if and when they try to replace the ACA's benefits — not paying for them at all, thus adding to the federal deficit.
But after dozens of auditors reviewed its system that had paid soldiers bonuses without determining their eligibility, the California National Guard's veterans started getting repayment notices.
It's a shame. The world is looking at it, Trump said in September of the state's struggles with homelessness.
Following Election, NRA Goes On 'Offense'; Here's What It Could Aim To Do
But it's actually already had an effect on the way that nuclear weapons are understood in Korea. So, for instance, if you go to Korea today, you find that there are people in politics out on the edges of - particularly on the far right who are now talking about developing nuclear weapons in ways that they weren't before. And in effect, Donald Trump sort of gave them permission to do so.
We can do better. We should expand the Child Tax Credit to provide real relief to tens of millions of working families struggling with the costs of raising children – the same families Donald Trump's plan largely ignores.
Here's a look at some of the more closely watched elements of the legislation.
ELVING: It could be, indirectly, because Facebook was a principal platform for a lot of the Russian disinformation campaign during 2016. And that's prompted a lot of soul-searching and policy change at Facebook, and that's got investors worried about whether more privacy and scrutiny might actually hobble future revenue and earnings. So Facebook had the biggest one-day loss in market history. Mark Zuckerberg absorbed a lot of that himself - the biggest loss for one individual. And Twitter also took a big hit. And CBS also took a big hit on news about sexual harassment allegations against their chief executive.
Ari Shapiro: Welcome to the show and congratulations on your win last night.

In April 2015, during a Supreme Court argument over the constitutional rights of LGBT individuals, Justice Samuel Alito noted that Bob Jones University in South Carolina had lost its tax-exempt status because of its prohibition on interracial dating and marriage.
Views of the U.S. among allies declined under Trump, and Biden is setting out to repair those alliances.
Lawmakers in Virginia have reached a deal to make the state the 16th in the nation and the first in the south to legalize recreational marijuana use. But the compromise bill is receiving blow back from some legalization advocates who say it falls short of racial justice aims.
With more than 52,000 confirmed U.S. cases of COVID-19 reported as of Tuesday afternoon, the illness is under the technical threshold for a rare disease. But cases are rising quickly and it seems inevitable that they will surpass 200,000.

MacGuineas adds that temporary tax policies are a terrible way to do business. Nonpermanent tax cuts like this one, she said, take away certainty for business owners.
GROSS: Does Biden have other plans to try to expand the ACA?
DICK MONKS: But this is where people want to be. I think Sanders can win because people really want him.
DAVIS: Right. So there isn't much precedent for how this would proceed. They certainly have the ability to do it. It's also important to know that this is a panel that's equally divided, 3-3, among Republicans and Democrats. It's intended to be - not nonpartisan but at least require bipartisan consensus to move forward.

Still. Even given the apocalyptic scenarios: Can you actually expect people to forgo something as deeply personal as having children? To deny the biological imperative that's driven civilization?

This is not a health pandemic yet, but it's rapidly becoming an economic pandemic, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
Just days after last year's call for unity before a joint session of Congress, for example, Trump tweeted — without any evidence — that Obama had wiretapped his home in Trump Tower.
The World Health Organization has called on nations around the globe to enact taxes on sugary beverages. And Bloomberg Philanthropies says raising taxes on sugary beverages can be part of the strategy to reduce consumer demand for unhealthy foods and beverages, improve the food environment, and make healthier choices easier for everyone.
Organizations claiming tax-exempt status cannot collect contributions on behalf of political campaigns or make any statement for or against a particular candidate. Clergy are not allowed to endorse candidates from the pulpit. (Despite Trump's promise to totally destroy the amendment, the president does not have the authority to do so on his own. Only Congress can repeal a law, in this case an amendment to the tax code.)
People are forced to sacrifice their creative abilities and go into corporate positions because those are guaranteed benefits, she says of other people she knows. To have it paid for! That's the lure of this place.

Ryan, R-Wis., has indicated that he would like to target welfare and entitlements, but Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are not on board with all that Ryan wants to do.
Expanded and extended federal unemployment benefits: The additional federal unemployment benefits that most people who have lost jobs are currently receiving would be increased from $300 per week to $400 per week and extended through the end of August.
So, why does it look like there are piles of cash sitting around? Education officials from the local level all the way up to the U.S. Department of Education say it comes down to the quirks of public education finance. States reimburse school districts for qualified expenses, districts draw down funds over the course of the school year, and all of it takes time to get reported back into the federal tracking system.

Eventually, the attacks concentrated on Trump. The nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute analyzed independent expenditures by superPACs and other outside groups, and reported that in the final week of February Trump was the target in 92 percent of all attack ads.
GREENE: So tell me what's happening here. What is the actual impact of holding an attorney general in contempt?
But by now, he said it was, you know, sort of time to cut bait. In conceding defeat at the White House this afternoon, Trump said he had long imagined a different strategy. Here's what he had to say.
Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.
These are silenced victims whose stories are never told by Hillary Clinton. But victims whose suffering is no less real or permanent. In short, the city of Detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent's failed economic agenda.

Mazur of the Tax Policy Center said people worried they cannot afford higher taxes should file their returns on time anyway. He recommended paying as much as possible with the return and then calling the IRS to arrange a payment plan for the rest. Not filing a return on time can cause penalties that are often worse than the penalty for paying taxes late, he said.
Second, the Colorado exchange is under fire from state lawmakers. As soon as the legislative session got underway in January, Republicans unveiled a bill to repeal the exchange altogether. They are expected to zero in on a recent federal audit that found the exchange improperly spent millions in federal funds and called for refunds.

But I think this is one of those examples that once he gets to Washington and begins to hear from a broader range of more mainstream economists that he will begin to see that, OK, you know, a trade war really is not his first priority. And this helps me kind of form a general theory of how Trump will or will not do the things that he says he would. And what I've come to believe based on a lot of these interviews over the course of the last several months with people in the campaign and outside is that on economic matters, on matters of sort of tax policy, for instance, and most trade elements, I think he will basically conform to a traditional conservative set of ideas. And by the end of the campaign, his tax policy, for instance, was a fairly conventional supply-side case. It really didn't depart substantially from what previous Republicans have run on.
Clark and Barrett might have started out with similar hopes, but their different experiences show how tough it can be for landowners to navigate the gas business and how resolutions are hard to come by.
DETROW: So you are talking to Venezuelan migrants in Florida. What are they saying about this latest order?
GRAVES: It's a new form of preemption basically - that's right. If a city does adopt such a measure, it would be denied revenue. And certainly a city could go ahead and adopt such a measure and then try to litigate it, but in the meantime, it's a very difficult environment if the state actually goes through with that threat and does not give funding for police and firefighters. It's an extraordinary hammer to impose on, in essence, the idea of offering paid sick, of having a city require paid sick leave within its jurisdiction.

The talks came on the same day the stock market shed nearly 3,000 points in its biggest daily decline in more than 30 years and President Trump's administration announced stringent guidelines to tighten public gatherings to 10 people or less. After news of the latest proposals emerged the markets did rebound some.

The finance ministry estimates 7 million Iraqis (out of about 40 million citizens) receive government salaries or pensions. But government revenues plummeted by 47.5% in the first eight months of last year, the World Bank reports. With drastically less oil revenue, the government has been paying its salaries and pensions intermittently or not at all. Economists say Iraq's poverty rate may have shot up from 20% in 2018 to 30% or more last year.
People have an extravagant idea about what might be on these returns, she says. A tax return is not a financial disclosure document.
And, of course, other factors have probably contributed to the new wave of establishment coverage: The huge population of candidates could be creating more content, for example. And then the biggest anti-establishment candidate of them all, Trump, is a click machine on any news website.

So if the tax policy was neutral, the business probably wouldn't buy the machine and it would keep the workers employed. But Acemoglu says even the current law favors machines, and the Republican tax bills tip the scales even more. So if you buy the machine, you'll get a huge handout from the government, he says.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Kevin, I'm going to ask you a different question. The president has given a lot of interviews this week, and in many, he's contradicted himself. In one with The Economist, he claimed to have invented an economic term that was coined in the 19th century. Many of his critics say - and even in The Economist article it said - that he's erratic and that he lacks knowledge. Does that worry you when you look at his words and they don't necessarily match up with other statements that he's given at different times?
In 1995, Speier, a state representative in California at the time, led the historic successful push in the state to outlaw discriminatory pricing for haircuts, dry cleaning, car repairs and other services based on gender. Now she aims to do the same at the federal level, with a bill tentatively titled the Pink Tax Repeal Act. This bill, which she plans to introduce in the U.S. House later this year, will aim to restrict discriminatory pricing of services as well as goods.

Just over half of Americans (52 percent) also say stricter gun laws should be an immediate priority, with 27 percent saying it shouldn't be a priority at all. Unsurprisingly, there's a big partisan divide underlying those numbers — about half of GOP voters (47 percent) say stricter gun laws shouldn't be a priority at all, while three-quarters of Democrats and half of independents say it should be an immediate priority.
Thank you. Small businesses will benefit the most from this plan. Hillary Clinton's plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what I am proposing, and her onerous regulations will put them totally out of business and you won't be able to start — you can not ever start a small business under the tremendous regulatory burden that you have in today in our country. We're going to end it. I am going to cut regulations massively massively.

With more than 50,000 confirmed U.S. cases of COVID-19 reported as of Tuesday afternoon, the disease is under the technical threshold for a rare disease. The law states that the number of patients must be fewer than 200,000 at the time of the submission of the request for orphan-drug designation.
That's really encouraging that we've had non-federal action on climate change the last fours, despite there being no action at the national level and even reversal, Hsu says. Even states that you wouldn't expect like Louisiana, just a couple months ago, set a target to decarbonize.
Garland, who would be the 86th attorney general, has pledged to return the Justice Department to normal order after four years of tumult under former President Donald Trump. That included personal attacks on prosecutors and FBI agents and allegations that Justice Department leaders had used their power to help Trump's allies and hurt his enemies.
ROBERTS: Expand the map means getting in white voters who - many of whom have sat out the elections in recent years - and it would mean especially in Midwestern states - Michigan, Ohio, Illinois - where you don't have huge minority populations, which could tip the states in an electoral college sort of situation.

WESSEL: Well, we don't know much. I mean, we're talking about a card-carrying capitalist here for sure. As you mentioned, he went - after he left Goldman Sachs in 2002, he went into the hedge fund business. He went into the business of financing movies, including Avatar, Life Of Pi. And he teamed up with some financiers to buy a failing bank called IndyMac in the dark days of 2008. They sold it at a huge profit seven years later after taking some flak for their foreclosure practices.
Compared to the previous law, ESSA also gives states freedom to define school quality using more than just test scores. That can include factors like attendance and access to arts, science and physical education. For more, here's a handy Education Week breakdown of some of the ideas states have turned in so far.

DEBORAH BIRX: The acts of selflessness that I am seeing are so impressive across the board. But if even 10- or 15% of the population decides that what they're doing today is more important than the health and welfare of the rest of the Americans, they can spread the virus in a very strong way because you know the level of contagion.
This is another result that might make the richest Americans squirm. The rich tend to earn their income in a different way from most other Americans. Besides paychecks, many make money from capital gains — income they get from selling investments like stocks. Most of those capital gains are taxed at a rate far below that top income tax rate. (People at any income level of course can have those kinds of investments, but capital gains are overwhelmingly concentrated at the top of the income spectrum.)

That's a deep issue that philosophers have debated for thousands of years, says University of Massachusetts philosophy professor Lawrence Blum, a specialist in the notion of altruism. In the purest sense, he says, motive does matter. Doing the right thing for the wrong reason is not really charity.
Then there's economic growth, which wouldn't be nearly as impressive under this plan as Trump would like. He said last week that he thinks he could get the economy to grow by 3.5 percent or 4 percent per year.

On the campaign trail, Lightfoot promised to put an end to Chicago's political machine once and for all and shine a bright light on corruption in City Hall.

It's more of a pro-Trump group that would want to break away from the GOP, Jones said, adding of the GOP infighting, There is frustration with both [sides] with each other. ... I think the civil war going on in the Republican Party is pushing them up to these higher levels of independents and those in favor of a third party.
MCEVERS: Even though the delegate math is decidedly against Bernie Sanders at this point, his campaign says he should be the nominee because he's polling better against Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton is in the general election. And these polls do show him ahead, right?
While Trump decries the mandate, the idea has Republican roots. The mandate was seen as a market-friendly alternative to a national health system or a strict requirement on employers to provide coverage.
ZARROLI: Once the slowdown ends, Congress is expected to pay federal employees back for the time they've lost, but the huge disruption to the economy could leave other problems in its wake. Previous shutdowns have hurt business confidence and left people a lot less certain that the government can address the problems it faces. And that could leave a residue of uncertainty that's a lot harder to eliminate. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.

He wants to reverse the Trump tax cuts but is pledging not to raise taxes for anyone making below $400,000 a year. He wants to raise the top tax bracket as well as corporate taxes; issue penalties for companies that move jobs overseas; increase the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour (equivalent to a yearly income of only $15,000) to $15 an hour, or $31,000 a year; and make it easier to join a union.

Fortunately, there's a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power.

One morning in early March, Jason Furman started thinking about the economic fallout from the coronavirus before driving his 4-year-old son to school. This was back in the pre-pandemic world when kids still went to school. But Furman saw an economic crisis coming, and he spent about an hour sketching out a plan for the government to act. His kid was a little late to school, but it was worth it.
With these new economic policies, trillions and trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country. This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans – We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions of more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.
After all, if a sous-chef needed an emergency appendectomy, the bill for a patient without insurance could be financially devastating. Offering health benefits, he says, is crucial to treating his employees' jobs as viable, long-term work.
ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Sherrod Brown calls this trip his dignity of work tour. He's an evangelist for workers and better wages. At a bookshop in Concord, he insisted, you don't win a state like Ohio if you don't understand that.

Nobody went to jail, and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of families went through our program, which was a program of getting greater resources to them so the child could be in school every day. The goal was for these children to be in school every day. The youngest of our children, who were missing critical days of their education that they could never make up. That was always the goal, and that was the goal that we achieved.

That energy spreads like wildfire, says Merryman, because people really feel now that there's some momentum in this movement and they can really affect change.
Now, this could be done on an emergency basis if EPA had the money, but Superfund is broke.
We import a fair amount of auto products from South Korea, said Jay Bryson, acting chief economist at Wells Fargo Securities. If that country were to shut down for any reasonable length of time, then you could have supply chain repercussions here in the auto industry in the United States.
At the beginning of January, the government raised prices on staple goods in an effort to cut the country's deficit. Gasoline prices, retirement plan contributions, and taxes on cars, phone calls, internet usage and hotel accommodation have all gone up, Reuters says.
In an emailed statement, a Gilead spokesperson wrote that when it sought the orphan designation, only a small number of Americans were affected by COVID-19. A company spokesperson declined to say when this was. The drug company said it has been making significant at-risk investments to study remdesivir and increase its supply during the global health emergency.
For example, a couple of years ago, the Tax Justice Network worked with the Australian Taxation Office to challenge deals that multinational corporations had set up through Singapore. Oil and gas giant Chevron ended up with a $1 billion tax bill.
Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., who aggressively investigated the Obama administration, has also called for what he termed an independent review of the Russia connections.
I think when people see his work and what he has promoted - and look at the stock market, it's done tremendously well. And the consumer confidence is high. So when you build on that and then you see a Schumer shutdown, you can see exactly who's making it very hard. Based on the illegal immigration, you're basically holding our men and women in armed forces hostage, senior citizens and students and kids. All these people are suffering just because Schumer - it's a democratic way of holding us hostage.
I'm confident we'll pass the bill next week, Cornyn said. Earlier is better.
GREENE: Well, and people feel uncertain, not just about investments - right? - but, I mean, even that their paychecks - I mean, whether, if businesses really suffer, they could be laid off in something like this.
NPR's Rachel Martin talks to Tom Smith, executive director of the American Society of Civil Engineers, about the current state of the nation's infrastructure. The group issued a report card in 2017.
We all agree on the benefits of tax reform and the place we want to land, and the question is how you reach that place, Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said in a statement. We continue to have productive discussions with the administration about all ideas on the table.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Jojo, what's your reaction? It was a tiny margin. What does that tell you?
And don't worry, we will not take the name off the Washington Monument. We will not cancel culture.
During the visit to Alamo — a small town in the Rio Grande Valley — Trump talked about his efforts to curb immigration, including the hundreds of miles of border wall constructed during his time in office, and measures to stop asylum-seekers.
In many cases, CAIR's Barzegar said, the same foundations contributing to after-school programs and homeless shelters are also unknowingly, he believes, giving to hate groups. He blames the Trump administration for legitimizing some of these anti-Muslim groups. For example, the head of ACT for America was welcomed at the White House.
In terms of other economic policies, to create jobs, we will be supporting medium-size businesses and small businesses, providing tax incentives to them.
LIASSON: Yes, but there's still several months to go. This has been a very unpredictable race, and it could stay that way.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: More than two dozen of the Trump administration's judicial nominees have declined to affirm the ruling. Most are still pending. But some like Vitter have already been confirmed by the Senate. Paul Butler is a former federal prosecutor. And he's now a professor at Georgetown University Law School. Welcome.
1. What is the Johnson Amendment?
But he acknowledges the system isn't foolproof, especially if someone decides to set aside some of the buds from those tagged plants.
The legislation will face legal challenges as well. On Wednesday, Butch Otter (R-ID) became the first governor to sign a law requiring the state attorney general to sue the federal government if it forces individuals to buy health insurance – a central tenet of the legislation. Other states are likely to pass similar measures, including Arizona, where the question will be put directly to voters.
That attention to engineering and quality is a hallmark of German manufacturing companies. Yvonne Schmittenberg says it's what makes Schmittenberg, and companies like it, competitive: Obviously we are under pressure and we have to fight for market share every day, but still quality is our main issue, and we would never shift to anywhere when quality is in slightest question.
At the beginning they were afraid to come to Paris, Noyer says. Because of perceptions about a rigid labor market and an uncertain tax system. Or they were saying, 'We'll increase a little bit, but we don't want to take the risk to make the hub (in Paris).' Now that's changing.
GARANCE BURKE: Some people had a really good experience on the show and felt like not only did Trump play the boss on TV, but he was a great leader and a compassionate mentor. But then, nearly two dozen of the people I spoke with in separate interviews mentioned feeling pretty uncomfortable with instances where Trump would talk publicly about women's bodies on set, you know, the breasts and rear ends of women he was working with and sometimes even the female contestants he might want to sleep with.
The second thing that happened, and this is what I've argued in my book, but now most people seem to agree, is that the Japanese officials during the early '90s, mid-'90s, were taking exactly the wrong course of policies. They were tightening policy on tax policy. They were tightening policies on monetary policy. They let the banking problems fester. They essentially accepted the decline of Japan as sort of inevitable, and that became self-fulfilling.
This virus is not SARS, it is not MERS, and it is not influenza, Tedros said at a briefing in Geneva. The nature of this virus means we have an opportunity to break the chains of transmission and contain its spread.

FOWLER: Well, Georgia is electing a new governor in November, and many people are watching. Voters are watching. Other candidates are watching to see what people are saying. And businesses may be watching. Atlanta is a finalist for the new Amazon headquarters, and it could be that Amazon picks somewhere else to go. But Delta is a longtime, homegrown company. And the perception may be the state might not be as welcoming as advertised, and Amazon may look elsewhere.
Rieder wears a tweedy jacket and tennis shoes, and he limps because of a motorcycle accident. He's a philosopher with the Berman Institute of Bioethics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and his arguments against having children are moral.

I know Democrats and Republicans can work together. I know it, because I have done it. I worked with Republicans and Democrats to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which today insures 8 million kids. I worked with Republicans and Democrats to bring jobs back to upstate New York and to help New York City heal and rebuild after the 9/11 attacks.
First, the Tax Foundation is not a nonpartisan think tank, as Ryan suggests. It's actually right-leaning.
There's a lot of acrimony that you can see in Congress and where we're sitting right now, it's probably hard to see a big bipartisan bill on climate change, says Greg Dotson of the University of Oregon, who also worked on energy policy in the U.S. House of Representatives. But I don't think that means you stop trying in Congress. Maybe it's tax policy. Maybe it's investment decisions. Maybe it's budgetary issues.
Calderon's story is long and complicated, but on the surface it's the kind of story that can strain some residents' empathy. It's easy to feel for the financial victim or the person who ended up homeless after a health crisis. It's more difficult to identify with the person who appears somehow complicit in his or her own circumstances, or appears to be doing something wrong.
Meanwhile the farm laws have yet to take effect. India's Supreme Court suspended their implementation in January, as protests raged. The Modi government has offered to keep them suspended for 18 months until a compromise can be reached with farm unions. But union representatives have refused. They want the laws scrapped altogether.
[The person claiming it] is typically a higher-income person. ... You have to make a pretty good amount of money before you can even enjoy the ability to use that tax deduction.
The Democratic leaders say the onus is on the president to come up with a way to pay for the improvements. Certainly in the Senate, if we don't have [Trump] on board, it will be very hard to get the Senate to go along, Schumer said.
These reasons include the birth or adoption of a child, caring for your own or a family member's serious health condition, or leave for military caregiving or deployment. An individual's job is protected during such leaves.
John Kasich: Negative Ads A Sign 'We're Expanding' In New Hampshire
79 percent of millennials worried that they will not have enough money to retire.
The economy will be in really good shape a year from now, Mnuchin said. This is not like the financial crisis where we don't know the end in sight. This is about providing proper tools and liquidity to get through the next few months.
Schaefer praised Cohn's ability to navigate smoothly among competing factions.
Such conspiracy thinking is consistent with his logic. The plots make sense in terms of his frame of reference — as seen through his filters of the Cold War, his time as a KGB operative in East Germany in the late 1980s, and the prevailing political views of conservative Russia circles.
Cohen also detailed to Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill., the surreptitious plot devised to dole out the payments through an LLC so that Melania Trump wouldn't discover them, and then Cohen used a personal home equity line of credit so that the payments both couldn't be traced back to Trump and so none of it would raise an eyebrow with Cohen's wife, who handles the couple's finances.
And Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich should finally pay their fair share of taxes.
But, beyond 2017, he says, the exchange could look to expand its other lines of business beyond the individual marketplace. That could include helping small employers and public sector employers not in the marketplace figure out insurance packages and benefits. I think that's somewhere where we can show some more value, he says.
That sign of inflation has market participants worried that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates, perhaps more aggressively than the three rate hikes already expected for this year.

While that legal battle was playing out, four automakers took California's side, agreeing to meet tougher standards than the Trump administration's fuel economy rules. Even General Motors, which had supported the Trump administration, just announced it would plan to sell all zero-emission cars by 2035.

I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance. Never had a chance.

Weiss is heading up the criminal investigation into President Biden's son, Hunter. Acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson called Weiss on Monday evening and asked him to remain in his current role, the official said.
These were sophisticated city and state politicians who designed these programs much better. They could have designed them much better. They could have cracked down on the loopholes that Trump drove his bulldozers right through, she says.
HOULAHAN: So I'm not sure exactly if you're asking me if there's an issue with the fact that there are only men in our delegation. I think that's clearly an issue (laughter).

She was first elected to the Baltimore City Council in 1999 and won a seat in the Maryland Senate in 2007. She drew widespread praise during the unrest in Baltimore over the death of Freddie Gray, a young black man who died while in police custody in 2015.
Syndicated columnist Esther J. Cepeda wrote in 2012 that the term perfectly captures the spirit of the moment, condemning both President Obama and Gov. Mitt Romney for Hispandering, which she described this way:
On the whole, the USMCA is not expected to have a large effect on the economy, compared to the North American Free Trade Agreement that it replaces. It does avoid the fallout that would have come from scrapping NAFTA without a replacement, as the president had threatened. — Scott Horsley, chief economics correspondent
As a nation, we can't be doing the kinds of things we were doing a few months ago, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health. It doesn't matter if you're in a state that has no cases or one case, you have to start taking seriously what you can do now.
CAMPBELL: The tax measures ballot language was disqualified in 2018, and it remains to be seen if its backers this year can get enough signatures to put it in front of voters in November. If they do, they can expect opposition from Republicans, including Governor Ducey.
Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community. No good, and we're going to stop it.
Many religious leaders have been critical of the refugee ban. The Johnson Amendment is named for then-Sen. Lyndon Johnson, who proposed the rule forbidding tax-exempt institutions such as churches to become involved in politics. It was imposed in 1954. Trump promised several times during his campaign to revoke it. He has not said how or when he intends to follow through on his pledge.
An analysis by J.P. Morgan found that nationwide, state government revenues fell only slightly — 0.12% — in 2020 compared to the year before the pandemic.

It's not just policy that wins voters over, though; it's also old-fashioned retail politicking and showing voters you feel their pain.
This comes after earlier guidance to help borrowers who are struggling with the economic ramifications of the spreading coronavirus. In that guidance, issued March 20, the department authorized an automatic suspension of payments for any borrower more than 31 days delinquent as of March 13, or who becomes more than 31 days delinquent, essentially giving borrowers a safety net during the national emergency. The department also announced that people with federal student loans will automatically have their interest rates set to 0% for at least the next 60 days.
Accounts differ on Kehoe's temperament. One former neighbor referred to his distant and rather cool manner, while another recalled, There couldn't be a better neighbor than him. Kehoe showed a violent streak early, killing his sister's beloved cat and possibly murdering his stepmother by rigging a gasoline stove, Schechter writes. His violence continued into adulthood — he killed a neighbor's dog because it buried a bone near his property and beat his own horse to death.

That owed money would have to be waived entirely under the new law, argued Grant.
I think it's like a really weird instinct that the Democratic Party develops to not be exciting intentionally, said Sean McElwee, co-founder of the progressive think tank Data for Progress. Most of politics is getting people excited enough to show up and vote for you.

Though Clinton has publicly called for tighter regulations on Wall Street, her tone in the speech excerpts contained in the leaked email are perhaps more conciliatory and friendly than she has publicly let on.
INSKEEP: You can find the Green New Deal resolution on our website today. NPR is the first to publish this call to transform the economy. It's a resolution calling for massive increases in renewable energy production, like wind and solar. It would have the United States set a goal to become carbon neutral in 10 years, which is a very ambitious timeline. This resolution says what should be done but offers few specifics on how to do it. That would have to come in later legislation. Instead, the congresswoman aims to promote big goals.

And though hospitals and other health care providers would be reimbursed at Medicaid rates — typically lower than those for commercial plans — to the extent that people who are uninsured enroll in the new plan, some providers say they stand to gain financially.
European officials last week imposed stiff tariffs on a wide range of U.S.-made goods sold within the European Union. The move came in response to Trump's recent decision to slap tariffs on European imports.
The show followed two failed runs for Congress that landed Pence flat on his face. His second run in 1992 was even more disastrous than the first. He was soundly defeated after election records showed he used campaign funds to pay his mortgage, golf fees and other personal expenses.
SIMON: We should note, of course, that former Speaker Hastert went to prison for using presumably some of the money he made to try and squelch a story about him forcing himself on a young student when he was a teacher and a wrestling coach.
Biden also proposed $350 billion in emergency funding for state and local governments — an idea which congressional Republicans have so far rejected.
OSNOS: They provide the greatest relief to the upper stratum of the tax base, so the highest earners will do best. There is also tax relief for the sort of upper-middle-class. Then corporate tax rates will be substantially relieved. This has been at the core of his plan. His economics team said to me that they want corporate tax relief, meaning changing the percentage that companies would have to pay to be their stimulus plan. They want to put more money in the hands of corporations so that that can then drive growth overall in the economy.

INSKEEP: David Wessel, always a pleasure talking with you.
WESSEL: Look, I think the most important thing is can he influence Donald Trump and his inner circle? A successful treasury secretary has to be able to convince the president to do things that are good for the economy even if they're politically unpopular. And he has to be able to convince him not to do things that are bad even if some of his advisers are telling him. And we really don't yet know whether Mr. Mnuchin will have that kind of courage and that kind of influence in a rather chaotic Trump White House.
BOLTON: Well, Schumer is shifting left because he's leader of a party that's shifting left. And there was a key moment just this past week where Schumer did a press conference with Senator Elizabeth Warren putting pressure on the Biden administration, on President Biden, to administratively cancel up to $50,000 worth of student debt for every federal student loan borrower. That's a pretty radical position in the Congress. And there are a lot of Democrats who still aren't entirely comfortable with it. But Schumer is up for reelection in 2022, and, you know, he's not taking any chances. He probably won't get a primary challenge. But Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she hasn't ruled out a primary challenge to Schumer. So Schumer is not letting it - there be any daylight on his left flank.

It's a different story in West Virginia, where royalty owners just scored a victory. Lawmakers did step in after the state Supreme Court sided with energy companies in a case last year. Now, the governor has signed a new law prohibiting gas and oil companies from deducting post-production expenses in certain types of leases.
Tucked into President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief law are provisions meant to help Black farmers, who have faced generations of systemic discrimination.

Still, even after a bipartisan task force came to broad consensus this year for a mandatory paid family leave benefit run by the state and funded through payroll taxes, Coloradans may have to settle for something far less ambitious if anything passes at all. The fight illustrates just how divisive paid family leave can be when determining how to pay for it.
At the White House daily press briefing on Tuesday afternoon, press secretary Sean Spicer said that Trump continues to meet with members and walk away with a very, very optimistic view of where the bill is headed. Spicer also said he didn't want to rule anything out with regard to further changes to the bill.
Black families tend to have significantly less wealth than white families, according to the Federal Reserve, and Black households are more likely to have student debt — and more of it — than white or Latino families. They're also more likely to default on their loans, even if they've earned a bachelor's degree, thanks to discrimination in the labor market.

As someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time. But that's not because of diminished American strength or some looming superpower. In today's world, we're threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states. The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia. Economic headwinds blow from a Chinese economy in transition. Even as their economy contracts, Russia is pouring resources to prop up Ukraine and Syria – states they see slipping away from their orbit. And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality.
The absence of those policies, he says, along with lower-than-expected inflation, has eased pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Rising U.S. rates would have put upward pressure on the dollar.

SNELL: And the Senate already had a strategy for how they want to handle documents and which witnesses they want to call. So this has not fully factored into that yet. But that doesn't mean that they couldn't add more information. Senator Schumer has said many times that they want to make sure that the witnesses and evidence reflect everything that is currently known about the president's involvement in this.
[Editor's note: Crowd chants Lock her up.]
SNELL: But, you know, it might actually just wind up being mostly symbolic. That's kind of how it's worked in the past. And so they may, if they want to get that information, still have to go to court if they want to get the information that they're asking for. And if this is symbolic, this then becomes a really big political move and a signaling move in that way.

Advocates voiced concern that the FDA's decision paves the way for Gilead to charge a high price for remdesivir. Many orphan drugs are among the most expensive medications in the United States, in part because generic competitors are delayed.
But if state coffers fared better on balance than many people expected early in the pandemic, backers of the president's plan say that's not the whole story.
HORSLEY: The administration also says China has agreed to buy a lot more U.S. goods and services - specifically $200 billion more over the next couple of years - compared to what Beijing was buying back in 2017 before the trade war started.
With your help, we will finally pass powerful requirements for voter ID. You need an ID to cash a check. You need an ID to go to a bank, to buy alcohol, to drive a car. Every person should need to show an ID in order to cast your most important thing, a vote.
SIMON: She's been - she's had choice words for Mr. Manafort.
MARTIN: You point to your experience as the governor of Washington as evidence that you can make this happen, that you can push policies to combat climate change - big ones. But that has been a hard slog for you in the state. You have had a recent victory, but in 2018, you tried to pass a carbon tax, and you didn't even get unanimous support from Democrats. What did you learn from that 2018 loss?
While many anti-poverty advocates don't like Ryan's approach, they are encouraged that at least he's talking about trying to find some way to help the nation's 43 million poor people.
MARTIN: Cynthia, I want to get your take on this. A recent New York Times/CBS News poll published yesterday gives us a picture of many people in the Tea Party movement. It says the 18 percent of Americans who identify themselves as Tea Party supporters tend to be Republican, white, male, married and older than 45. The study also finds that Tea Party supporters are more likely than the general public and Republicans to say that too much has been made of the problems facing black people.
MARTIN: The benefit of the proposal from the Republicans and Steve Mnuchin in particular, the Treasury secretary, has said that Americans need relief right now. He wants to cut a check to every single individual so that payments would go out in two weeks. Is what you're proposing - not this immediate stimulus that would go into their pockets, but a larger, holistic systemic reform - would that delay the relief?
SAGAL: This week, a federal judge dismissed former Alaska governor blank's lawsuit against The New York Times.
I know some in Congress think we've already done enough to deal with the crisis in the country, Biden said when he announced the plan at the White House earlier this month. That's not what I see. I see enormous pain in this country.
The Panama Papers revealed that a company in Uganda avoided $400 million in taxes in an oil deal. That represents more than the country's annual health budget. Does that upset citizens?
MARTIN: So I'll urge you through.
SUAREZ: One senator for whom the repeal of the mandate had been a sticking point was Republican Susan Collins of Maine. Originally, she noted that repealing the mandate would have consequences for the future stability of the individual market. Now, she says she'll back the tax bill if Congress acts on other health measures. What are they?
But could we possibly create a new revenue stream to pay farmers to sequester carbon? Could we pay them and encourage climate-smart agricultural practices that would result in cover crops and crop diversity and crop rotations that would be different? So instead of only getting what they get for their corn and soybeans, they get a carbon payment.
A wallstreetbets member, who vowed not to sell GameStop, wrote late Wednesday: I am proud to be a part of this piece of history with you. ... Call it an opportunity, call it revenge, or justice, I know we are on the right side of this.

NIH Official Urges Vigilance On Coronavirus As White House Floats Economic Proposals
While all that was happening, the Women's March on Washington protesting Trump and his policies toward women drew thousands and thousands of people — and the second-highest Metro ridership day ever, second only to President Obama's first inauguration. Protests weren't just limited to D.C., though — similar events happened across the country that also drew massive crowds. And the protests even went worldwide, happening on all seven continents.
ELVING: What we saw with Watergate was that it took an enormous amount of time for the story to unfold. There were more than two years between the original burglary - the original break in at the Watergate complex and the resignation of President Nixon. It took a great deal of time for public opinion to swing in favor of impeachment. And in those many months, Nixon turned the public against him with his efforts at cover up and his defiance of the other branches of government - Congress and the courts.
But it's not clear. You know, Donald Trump really is so different than anybody that we've had before that for him to change now at the age of 70 and take on a whole new set of decision-making instincts and to begin to challenge his own assumptions and his own instincts to say, look, the things that got me here are not the things that will help me succeed. I find that hard to imagine.
But a question remains. All in for what?
Acemoglu says building hiring and training incentives into the tax bill could have helped push the U.S. more in that direction.
I'm concerned the effects will be ... not good. And likely very large, remarks Andi McClure, an independent game developer. She pointed to other legislation she describes as having unintended consequences, including the anti-sex trafficking legislation known as FOSTA-SESTA, which is criticized by sex workers who said it endangered them by driving them off certain virtual platforms. I do see concerns in the community that things seem to be changing and not for the better in general.
That's because the AMT tends to kick in for certain kinds of deductions more than others.
Opposition to the gutting of the office was swift and came from some unexpected sources in addition to Trump.
The law allowed workers to keep their children on their plans until they reach age 26, even if they're married, financially independent and live in another state. Republicans have said they may keep this popular provision in place if they dismantle the law.
Farmers know how to grow, but farmers don't know how to sell, Lodha says. The biggest problem the farmer is facing is that he doesn't know how to market his product.
In recent years, though, reconciliation has become a popular tool to get big partisan bills passed when one party has full control of Washington. Democrats used reconciliation to pass some health care changes in 2010, and Republicans used it to pass tax cuts in 2017, as well as in their failed attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act during Donald Trump's presidency.
PAT CLARK: He comes from a state, a gritty state, Ohio.
The COVID-19 relief bill working its way through Congress is full of big ideas to help people. But there's one idea that's so big, it was politically unthinkable not that long ago.
Yentel says in the past, she and other advocates would listen to presidential debates and town halls waiting for the candidates to say anything about the affordable housing shortage and just sort of hang on for any word even remotely related to housing. Like, oh, he said 'community' or he said 'house.'

One of Wood's lawyers, Gregg I. Shavitz, argued that without the promise of work through November, Bloomberg field staffers may have chosen to pursue other opportunities.
RNC Chairman Reince Priebus zeroed in on this criticism in a statement:
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: ...Sacred duty to mingle in the operations of government every degree of moderation and tenderness which the national justice, dignity and safety may permit.
Millennials are on track to be the least entrepreneurial generation in history, EIG co-founder John Lettieri told the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship earlier this year. Millennials admire startup founders and revere self-employment, the new survey findings show, but they're wary of starting businesses in an unforgiving economic environment.
In addition to her duties preparing the morning business section of the RECORD, Liz can be found sitting at the corner of the Reporters' table in the well of the Senate, listening intently to our every word, ready to chase us down to retrieve those materials we have asked to have printed in the RECORD. We will miss her dedication and wonderful sense of humor, Dole said.
HARRIS: No, he's not. He actually said, you know, if we'd only known about this a couple of months ago, we could've been in better shape. But actually, the first known case in Wuhan were diagnosed in mid-December. And on December 31, China alerted the World Health Organization. It was a really fast turnaround.
SAGAL: It's a little strange. All right. You have one more chance here. If you get this one, you win. A group of interns at NASA did something a little bit wrong in 2003. What was it? A - they stole $21 million worth of moon rocks. B - they accidentally launched a rocket a day early. Or C - they sent out a press release announcing the end of the world via asteroid.

I'm here alone, without my mother, while too many politicians cower behind the gun lobby instead of standing with American families, Smegielski said.
The Republican candidates are also out across New Hampshire today. Their schedules are packed with rallies and town hall meetings. And our colleague, Robert Siegel, is there, too. After a town hall this afternoon in Claremont, he sat down to talk with Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who had a lackluster finish in yesterday's Iowa caucuses.
In February 2012, Victor Aphanasenko, editor of a newspaper that had been investigating paramilitary raids in southern Russia, died after slipping in his home.
The IRS has not identified a cause of the outage, although it says it appears to be a hardware-related issue.
Former Mich. Governor Outlines How To Convince Companies To Stay
North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland. We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening, Trump said. Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position.
A lot of people feel it's safer here because it's so uncrowded, Rysdahl said.
This is a way to find a way to change spending and revenue that does not have to deal with the partisan gridlock, Moller said. It's not a backdoor process; it's more like express lanes on the highway. It's a way to get you where you want to go, sometimes faster, oftentimes with less congestion.
I'm sure some of you are thinking, that all sounds good. But what about trade? After all, Trump talks about it all the time.
In general, federal rules require that insurers charge the same rates for identical qualified health plans that are sold on and off the exchanges. The CMS guidance suggests that the unloaded plans could be tweaked slightly in terms of cost sharing or other variables so that they are not identical to those on the marketplaces.
But the deal came about because of concessions from Trump, too. According to the Times, Trump and Pence are expected to reiterate their campaign pledges to be friendlier to business by easing regulations and overhauling the corporate tax code, while Trump is expected to tone down his rhetoric threatening 35 percent tariffs on companies like Carrier that shift production south of the border.
BURGESS: I'll tell you this. I think the Democrats learned back in 2016 a lot. And I think that's why you're starting to see that now with some of these races. What I always say is elections have consequences, and if you don't participate, then you're going to be part of the consequence. And I think that people are seeing that they've got to motivate, get up, vote. Whether they want to or not, they still need to follow their civic duty and vote, so they can be part of the process and have their voice heard. And I think that Democrats learned that sitting at home in 2016 caused us an outcome that we really didn't want. So we'll see how it all shapes out whenever it comes to the November - when we get the midterm elections going.
Sineneng-Smith was subsequently convicted of mail fraud, tax violations and of illegally encouraging or inducing an alien to remain in the U.S.
ROVNER: Well, there's two. And one of them would restore these payments that the president cut off last fall that go to insurers to reimburse them for discounts they have to give to their lowest-income enrollees on the exchanges. They're called cost-sharing reduction payments. But basically, the insurers have already figured out how to get that money back. They've raised premiums strategically, and that made premium subsidies higher. So basically, the federal government is giving them back the money in other ways. So most analysts think that it's probably too late for that to help.
Hansen sees a domino effect in progress, helped along by some political tailwinds: the Democratic midterm wave elections, the women's #MeToo movement. There are just a lot of big movements happening here.
KING: I want to ask you specifically about schools and about children because you have got a lot of concerned parents out there. At the same time, you're saying the people most at risk are older and have underlying health problems. Should parents with young, healthy, vibrant children be worried about this?
[FBI Director James Comey had plenty of criticism for Clinton but said no reasonable prosecutor would charge Clinton with a crime for the emails. — Carrie Johnson]
On parents' weighing the risk of sending their kids back to school
KELLY: He's persuaded you. You are a respected voice in conservative economic circles. Do you harbor any sneaking suspicion that you have been brought on board to give some sort of stamp of credibility to a tax plan that, as you know, has come under criticism from the left and the right?
This statistic from a 2014 Bloomberg study came as a huge surprise to Joanna James, a journalist-turned-filmmaker who is also the daughter of a female restaurateur. When she decided to make her first documentary feature film about her mother's journey as a chef, restaurant owner and single mother, she had no idea that her mother's struggles to establish herself in the restaurant industry were commonplace among women.
SALTER: Yeah, you know, you sort of have to. But, you know, I - I'd like to go back to a life where someone like Donald Trump's opinion on anything doesn't matter in the slightest. But if you turn away, if you avert your gaze, then you don't address the elephant in the room, which is just what I said, that we have an unfit man in the most powerful office on Earth. And we need to do something about it.
GINGRICH: Well, the country will be increasingly angry at everybody.
This is not the first time in history that we see those neuropsychiatric, neurocognitive complications, she says. So, we put it under this bigger rubric of a post-viral syndrome.
LIASSON: I give it slim odds here. As you said, he immediately got pushback from his own chief of staff, from Republicans in the Senate, including the Republican leader, Mitch McConnell. They think that's too much money. They certainly don't want to raise the gas tax to pay for it. And it's just another example of how the president is having trouble working the levers of his own government. He couldn't get his own Homeland Security department to do what he wanted them to do at the border. And if he can't make a deal with Mick Mulvaney, the chief of staff, and Mitch McConnell, he's certainly not going to be able to make one with Nancy Pelosi.
POGGIOLI: He said, the right thing to do today is to stay home. Our future and that of Italy is in our hands. He focused primarily on young people, who tend to socialize a lot, especially in the evenings. He told them they're going to have to hunker down for the good of their families, their grandparents and the nation.
President Trump signed an executive order Thursday that directs the executive branch to honor and enforce existing protections for religious liberty and asks agencies to consider issuing amended regulations for organizations that don't want to cover contraception in employer health insurance plans.
This change could help lift nearly 10 million children above the poverty line or get them closer to it, according to the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
WHITMER: I know people weren't excited about a gas tax. No one is, even me. But the fact of the matter is, I've inherited an incredibly serious infrastructure crisis, and I'm trying to fix it.

ROBERTS: But, you know, I - you always wonder, though, at this stage in the year - in the calendar, why would these rules come out? And yes, the president wants to get a lot done before his time is up. But it also might be a political ploy on the part of the administration to try to get young people excited and remind them that the Republicans, in many cases, are against transgender people, gay marriage, that kind of thing, just an attempt to keep the Obama coalition together going into the election.
This includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. They are the greatest that ever came about. They are the greatest currency manipulators ever.
Louail is right to acknowledge there is more to cities than just data. Still, this work illuminates a promising path to not only understanding social problems in new ways, but also to finding new ways to solve them.

Of course, if you don't happen to be a member of the party with two candidates on the fall ballot, top-two may leave you feeling more excluded than a closed primary.
France Telecom's chief executive, Didier Lombard, is facing calls to quit. There are also calls for an inquiry into working conditions blamed for pushing staff over the edge. Lombard was booed as he arrived at headquarters Tuesday.

This is a very unique situation in this economy. We've put a proposal on the table that would inject $1 trillion into the economy, that is on top of the $300 billion from the IRS deferrals.

Pioneer Credit Recovery, Enterprise Recovery Systems, National Recoveries and Coast Professional are all servicers — middlemen that collect student loans on behalf of the federal government. In 2015, the Obama administration ended their contracts, accusing them of misinforming borrowers who were trying to get out of default. The companies sued.
In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others who have done far less, have paid so dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come.
If the company contributes at the half-wage level, it will receive a tax credit equal to 12.5 percent of the amount it pays to the worker. The tax credit will increase on a sliding scale if the company pays more than 50 percent of wages. It could go up to a maximum credit of 25 percent of the amount the employer paid for up to 12 weeks of leave.
GREENE: And so that's what you're talking about with the skunk being in the garden. That's putting tougher politics into this tax conversation.
At that point, they would say that the United States has basically not held up its end of the bargain, and they would have the right - the legal authority and the right - to restart the development of nuclear energy. So I think he's going to find once he begins to get into the details of this that by simply announcing that he's going to renegotiate that might not achieve the effect he has in mind. It might actually hasten the restart of the Iranian nuclear program.
We simply can't take it any longer, Karvelis said.

U.S. farmers, in particular, have been targeted with tariffs from those nations, both because they're big exporters and because farmers were generally supportive of Trump.
However, the Trump administration could appeal Alsup's ruling.
With transmission rates rising and hospital capacity dwindling, many states are slowing or altering their reopening plans, reintroducing restrictions and tightening mitigation measures. In the absence of a federal mask mandate, most states have issued their own. Many are reimposing limits on gatherings, businesses and other activities, sometimes statewide and sometimes on a county-by-county basis. State leaders are also announcing ever-evolving testing criteria, relief programs, school guidance and travel restrictions.
Economists Alexander Ljungqvist of New York University's Stern School of Business and Michael Smolyansky of the Federal Reserve recently tried to answer the question by looking at fluctuations in corporate tax rates at the state level.

There are furloughs and layoffs at major hotel chains, including Marriott and Hyatt. U.S. airlines are pleading for $58 billion in government loans and grants. Travel industry groups are warning that millions of jobs will be lost to the lockdowns and social distancing caused by the coronavirus. And as NPR's Alina Selyukh reports, the hit to tourism goes way beyond hotels and airplanes.
Let me say something about your remarks. There's no candidate who has talked more about poverty in this country than I have. The fact is we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on earth, which is a national disgrace; 35 percent of African-American kids are living in poverty; 51 percent of African American high school graduates between 17 and 20 are unemployed or underemployed.
Economist Jared Bernstein says there is something to the idea that there are still underlying economic problems. He served as chief economist to former Vice President Joe Biden but has not publicly endorsed a candidate.
SIMON: It's moved to the capital. As we said Secretary Price has resigned, but at least three more Cabinet members face similar accusations about charter jets. Whatever happened to them, can the Trump administration say they'll drain the swamp when they seem to be flying over it in private jets?
Their names are on a roll of honor with almost 30 more dauntless Russian reporters. Let us hope brave Russian journalists stay away from windows.

The longer it takes, as you go later on in history, well, now you've got a health care industry building up. There's doctors. There's hospitals. People have got their insurance arrangements in place. And inevitably, you're going to have to disrupt some of those things. You're going to have to take some money out of people's pockets and move it somewhere else. And that is very hard to do politically. And so it gets complicated.

Currently, Ryan and other Republican leaders don't need Democrats to pass the bill. They can afford to ignore Schumer.
And what I would have - and counseled, and it was rejected - I would have had a preamble to our platform saying, look; we are a pro-life party. That is a basic tenet of the Republican Party. But we do not reject the participation of anyone who - just because they disagree on this or any other specific issue as important as that issue might be. You see my point?
Critics say NLMK is exaggerating its supply problem because it wants to continue buying slabs at a steep discount from its parent company in Russia, whose majority shareholder Vladimir Lisin is the wealthiest person in that country.

After a short and bruising campaign against Democratic Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, Lightoot went on to win a landslide victory in the April 2 runoff.
SYKES: Yes. And that's the most painful position to be in because there are things that he has done that plausibly, you could say, are positive. But the price tag is horrific. And, you know, this is - I can't get past what Donald Trump is doing to our political culture, to society. You know, character used to matter to conservatives. But the bullying, the chronic lying, the name-calling, the attacks on the rule of law, the attacks on democratic institutions, the, you know, fanboy adulation of autocratic thugs around the world. You know, not to mention his personal, you know, his personal business dealings.

You've criticized Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld for not having enough troops when we invaded Iraq.

FAUCI: No, they should not be. But let me explain - there's a little bit of a hitch to it. If you look at the mortality and the morbidity in children, it's significantly less; it's very low. So for reasons that we still don't understand, children, young adults do very well. However, one of the things, when you have infection control, that you have to be careful of is that children may get infected and do well and not feel sick at all and then inadvertently, perhaps, infect someone in the home who is vulnerable, mainly the group that I just described.

The royals used to be here all the time, but now it's all about austerity. They don't want to flaunt their yachts paid for by big businessmen.
Music: Chu Chu and Lady Surfing.
SHAPIRO: Well, so what about this line from Speaker Pelosi that the president is goading Democrats towards impeachment? Do you think that's true?
SMITH: They have a $10 billion surplus.
Don't forget when Romney got beat. Romney, hey. Did you see his? I wonder if he enjoyed his flight in last night. But when Romney got beaten, you know, he stands up like you're more typical, Well, I'd like to congratulate the victor. The victor? Who is the victor, Mitt? I'd like to congratulate. They don't go and look at the facts. No, I don't know. He got, he got slaughtered. Probably, maybe it was OK, maybe it was. But that's what happened.
Dan Moore, a 58-year-old steel mill worker, gives the president an A+ on everything from tax cuts to foreign policy, but he is not so sure about tariffs.
These families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protect them and certainly none to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Believe me. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities.
The survey finds that 47 percent of registered voters would definitely vote against a candidate who wanted to remove Trump from office, while 42 percent would definitely vote for a candidate who would make such a promise. Forty-seven percent of independent voters — whose opinions could be decisive — also say they would vote against candidates favoring impeachment.
Earlier, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup told reporters they would suspend all political donations. Airbnb, Comcast and others said they were suspending PAC donations to Republicans who objected to the Electoral College vote. The newsletter Popular Information is tracking such corporate responses, also adding Marriott and BlueCross BlueShield to the list.
The bill, which will go through many revisions and challenges, was released late Monday by two House committees, Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce. Members are expected to start voting on parts of the bill Wednesday.
But with outside groups like governors associations free to raise and spend unlimited money without the same restrictions, watchdog groups worry that these state-level pay-to-play laws could lose their effectiveness.
Details about the deal dripped out Thursday morning. United Technologies Corp. (parent company to Carrier) will get $7 million in tax breaks over 10 years, the Wall Street Journal reports, but the Indiana Business Journal adds that the company was also scared of losing federal contracts.
The remarks at the 40th annual iteration of the event came less than 24 hours after the House passed its version of the relief package with provisions aimed at bolstering the nation's vaccination campaign, stimulating the economy and providing aid from checks to rental assistance to individual Americans. The bill, which now heads to the Senate, also includes provisions for those living in poverty and assistance for families with children.
TIMMONS: Well, I think the fact that the White House came out afterwards and is telling people that that tweet was drafted by a lawyer shows that they think it's significant. And the fact that they would try to use a lawyer - and the lawyer that they're referencing is a real veteran guy. And the idea that he would use that kind of sloppy language is sort of unfathomable. So obviously, the White House thinks this is important.
And now the only way they can get out of that because they hate that it's not good in the social circuit. And the only way they get out is to rule against Trump. So let's rule against Trump. And they do that. So I want to congratulate them.
That was really great. Thank you so very much.
Third, who will really go to bat for working families?
You can look across the street from the church and see the dilapidated housing. You can see the houses on both sides of the church are falling down, Evans said. You don't need me to point that out.
Asked how he feels now about the assurances he made as a recruiter to potential staffers, Jethwani said, Mike borrowed my credibility and abused it in that moment.
President Trump just can't let it go.
Specifically, Putin appears to believe that Michael McFaul, the former U.S. ambassador to Russia, was personally directing these kinds of operations against him.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Let's look abroad. There's fighting in Gaza, as you heard, with presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner's peace plan still in the works. There's Venezuela, North Korea, a lot.
SHERROD BROWN: Democrats think you have to choose between running to the progressive base, as I believe we should, and talking to working families, talking to workers, that it's a choice. And it can't be a choice.
But Covered California's executive director, Peter Lee, says he is planning for a different scenario. He hopes to position California as a leader in a new model for health coverage nationwide.
It turns out they do better in school ... When they're older, their health is better. They're less likely to be engaged in criminal activity, and they live longer. And all of those things are great for the child, but they're also great for society.
You worked in the sawmill, you drove log truck, or you worked in the woods, logging, unless you wanted to drive to Lewiston there wasn't a whole lot for guys to do, he says.
I should point out that every president when they come in uses executive powers in one form or another. Barack Obama, for instance, signed nine executive orders in the first 10 days. Doing 25 would be ambitious. People who have been through transitions before tell me that's not realistic. But he could do several things that would significantly undermine the legacy of the Obama presidency. His team has talked about this since Election Day, that one of the things that's important to them is to restart exploration of the Keystone Pipeline.
But the answer is not to rant and rave – or to cut ourselves off from the world. That would kill even more jobs. The answer is to finally make trade work for us, not against us.
Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place.
Successful reentry and rehabilitation is a public safety issue, full stop. But more importantly this is an issue of fairness, Warren told WLRN.
McElroy says there is one thing he would like to change about the NHS. His comedy routine includes another joke about what happened after he had minor surgery in Britain.
Some industry officials push back against these claims.
In Clark County, Nevada, the accuracy settings on signature verification machines were purposely lowered before they were used to count over 130,000 ballots.
Our next guest knows a thing or two about government shutdowns. It is Newt Gingrich. He was House speaker in 1995. He and then-President Bill Clinton reached an impasse over the budget, and parts of the government shut down twice, actually. The first '95 shutdown was in November and lasted five days. The second was about a month later. It lasted 21 days, and that was the record until this current shutdown, which hit 21 days on Friday. And that is when we called Newt Gingrich.
GREENE: The voice of one Parisian there speaking to NPR's Eleanor Beardsley, who like so many people in Paris are just trying to understand all of this, what happened yesterday at Notre Dame. Eleanor, thank you so much.
The winning bid is expected to be chosen by the General Services Administration, which declined to comment for this story. The president is likely to have no direct role in the decision, says Steven Kelman, professor of public management at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
Let's shut off the revolving door in Washington, and make sure the foxes aren't guarding the henhouse.
As Julie Rovner wrote last year, dozens of religious nonprofits claimed that even the act of notifying the government of their objections (which would, in turn, trigger a requirement for the government to arrange coverage) made them 'complicit' in providing a service they see as sinful.
The National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers has blamed energy drink guzzling for poor behavior in school. The group has called for research in the area and supported the grocery store restrictions.
Warren offered scores of solutions in her broad proposal. Some, like a requirement for presidential candidates and all other federal officeholders to release their tax returns, were a direct response to scandals or ethical questions raised by the Trump administration's flouting of long-held disclosure and conflict of interest norms.
The transition process is routine for an incoming administration, although there were questions — particularly from Republican lawmakers — about what the Biden team would do about both the Hunter Biden and the Durham probes.

President Trump told a group of small-business owners Tuesday that the nation's economic future has never looked brighter. But that future could be imperiled by Trump's own multifront trade war.
Now, Trump leaves office as the only president to be impeached twice, and the House vote against Trump over the Capitol insurrection marked the most bipartisan impeachment in U.S. history.
Preston's reverence for those who have served our nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem, Trump said.
I printed it out just to show her today, she said. And I think that it matters to her. I think that she'll feel that for me — that it's a burden.
RITA MABLI: We do have some families that are very angry at not being able to visit mother or father. And I understand that. And I so empathize with that.
LIASSON: That's right. The president said last year that there were very fine people on both sides. He seemed to draw an equivalence between the white nationalist marchers and the people who protested them, one of whom was killed by a man with neo-Nazi connections. And although yesterday, the president did tweet that he condemned, quote, all types of racism - it almost sounded like he was talking about bad people on both sides - he has regularly continued to demean African-Americans. Recently, he attacked the intelligence of a African-American congresswoman, an African-American television anchor and LeBron James, the basketball star. And he repeatedly goes after African-American football players who kneel during the national anthem. This weekend, he tweeted they should be suspended without pay.
DAVIS: Not good. Not good. They're not - they're angry. There's a lot of anger, especially from progressive Democrats. This is a very common reaction we heard today from Pramila Jayapal, who's the chair of the House Progressive Caucus.
SCHRAGER: Yeah. I mean, the emergency department has been busy - not quite as busy as I've seen before. But we're just seeing a whole lot of people with coronavirus-type illnesses. It's a high-stress place. I think, you know, my colleagues around the country have, you know, been spreading the message that they lack protective equipment. I've been fortunate to have good support from our hospital leadership and my emergency department leadership. And we're being stewards of our protective equipment to the degree that we can. So I feel fairly safe, as much as one can during this outbreak.
SHIELDS: (As narrator) This is our fight, the fight for freedom.
Stephen Karban is an inmate at the state prison in Florence, Ariz. Reached via email, he said prison officials told him the debit cards would be sent to inmate banking to maintain in a safe pending a conversation with the IRS to determine how to return the debit cards and have the IRS issue checks.
Colombia and Argentina have closed their borders to arriving foreigners; Chile follows suit tomorrow (Wednesday). Ecuador and Paraguay have nighttime curfews, Reeves says, and in Brazil, firemen using megaphones are patrolling beaches in Rio de Janeiro, asking people to go home. Tourists must cancel plans to visit Rio's Sugarloaf Mountain and the statue of Christ the Redeemer — like so much else here, they're now closed.
But Grant also said that the fact that only Democratic counties are using the provision absolves him of much of the criticism he faced when writing and debating, and then later passing, the state law. Activists and some Democrats suggested that he was creating a racist poll tax to make it harder for poor Floridians to cast votes in a way that would benefit the Republican Party.
We can join forces, stop the shouting and lower the temperature. For without unity there is no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos. This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward.

The drama played out this week with Cheney keeping her spot in leadership but seeing 61 of her colleagues vote to remove her from the post. Just 11 Republicans, on the other hand, voted with Democrats to remove Greene from committee assignments after her own leadership did nothing in choosing not to discipline her.

I support the protesting farmers 100%! says Gohad, standing amid burlap sacks of ginger and gooseberries in his garage next to the APMC.
At one point, Trump owed $3.4 billion. He was personally on the hook for more than $800 million.
ELIZABETH WARREN: Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.
Parra says both Democrats and Republicans have wised up and learned to avoid the most obvious hallmarks of Hispandering. At this point in the game, you're not likely to catch Bernie Sanders sporting a guayabera on Calle Ocho in Miami or spot Ben Carson chowing down on a King Taco in Los Angeles.
The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll surveyed 1,011 U.S. adults from April 10-13 with a margin of error of +/- 3.6 percentage points. A subsample of 827 registered voters resulted in a margin of error of +/- 3.9 percentage points.
KING: Let's talk about what ails us because Jerome Powell did point this out yesterday. He recognized that a rate cut can only do so much. Let's listen to what he said.
MARTIN: So the economy is pretty strong right now. Is that the result of these tax cuts?
DAVIS: Don't you think that the speaker, however, has a point when she says, this country is so divided that an impeachment proceeding could be just incredibly corrosive to the country?
I visited Philadelphia to gauge how the tax has impacted businesses and people in the city. I walked a few city blocks with Larry Ceisler, a spokesperson for the Ax The Bev Tax coalition, which is funded by the industry. As we passed a small supermarket, he told me the tax is having a negative effect.
Price also supports the proposal by House Speaker Paul Ryan to turn Medicare into what some call a voucher program. Under the plan, beneficiaries would receive premium support from the government to buy a Medicare health plan through an exchange. The private plans would compete against the traditional government-run program.
I can tell you, though, that some of the governors they spoke to - they spoke to them via teleconference at FEMA - they were very frustrated about not having enough supplies, including masks. The South Dakota governor, for example, said commercial suppliers have been canceling their orders. President Trump, though, responds that his - and his aides keep saying that supplies are there, so we're seeing a disconnect.
GRANHOLM: Glad to be on. Thanks so much.
Manafort has been held there since June 15, when a judge in Washington, D.C., ordered him detained, partly because of new charges that he had attempted to tamper with witnesses.
This can be a period of great reconsideration by the press of how it operates, even as the stories arise all around us.
It's no secret that one of the barriers to development is a lack of transmission capacity to move the wind- or solar-produced electricity from where it's produced to where it needs to be used, Soholt says.
Those association health plans — a longtime favorite Republican concept — are a cornerstone of the current White House's health policy. But they remain controversial and are often held to less stringent coverage standards than other forms of insurance. They may have caps on coverage spending, for example, and may not cover some of the Affordable Care Act's essential benefits, such as maternity care and prescription drugs.
The decision to award remdesivir orphan designation as a treatment for COVID-19 also puzzled Ken Kaitin, who directs the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development. If the FDA's goal was to speed development, he said it could do that in other ways.
The major pieces of the bill — payments to individuals, extended unemployment, money for states and localities, money for schools — all of those things were in the COVID package that passed last year that all the Republicans voted for. So they were OK then, but they're not OK now, and I frankly can't really figure out that argument.
That's when Ladd Erickson stepped in. He's the attorney for McClean County, North Dakota, where the coal plant is located, and he launched a battle over access to that power line. The transmission line is everything, he says. It's the golden goose.
Many states moved last fall to limit silver loading to plans sold on the exchanges, while allowing or, in the case of California, requiring, very similar plans to be sold off the exchanges without the extra premium charge.
BOWMAN: Well, these Kurdish villagers are - in Syria - are desperately afraid of the Turkish invasion. Turkey sees these Kurds as allied with Kurdish militants inside Turkey. And they say Turkey was shelling their villages. Turkish militias were sacking their homes.
Starting sometime early this spring, Apple will require apps to send a push alert where people can either choose to ask app not to track or allow.
Now we've got to accelerate the transition away from dirty energy. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future – especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. That's why I'm going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet. That way, we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system.
I think our generation is going to have to try to figure this out, he says.
So rather than aiming their protests directly at legislators, teachers are seeking the approval of a proposed 2018 ballot initiative that would raise taxes on corporations and the wealthy to increase funds for public education.
And we will fix TSA at the airports! Which is a total disaster.

Other gas companies are developing similar plans for decarbonizing with renewable gas, and other countries are too.
Another provision in the bill, which makes the first $10,200 in unemployment insurance payments tax-exempt for many Americans, is a further complication.
Overturning the law, however, would also have major implications for campaign finance. If churches or clergy are allowed to participate in political campaigns, tax-free donations to the churches could go to support a political candidate. Religious organizations could become bigger money players in politics.
Here are some of the challenges that Trump and the experts she met with identified in that White House meeting: The early years are critical for brain development but quality, safe, affordable child care is often hard to come by. There are mile-long waiting lists for care that, for many families, costs more than their housing. And yet, a lot of child care workers can't make ends meet.
BLUM: The more sophisticated people have networks of trusts and offshore corporations in multiple jurisdictions. And what this information will show is how the really sophisticated stuff operates.
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham favors a Medicaid buy-in option. She doesn't have a position on the current bill, but she is following it closely, says Nora Sackett, the governor's deputy press secretary.
MARTIN: One of the reasons I invited both Puneet and Kathleen here is that you are both people who actually have to win elections locally because this is a midterm election. Now, Virginia just had its legislative elections. But you've got a Senate seat opening up in 2018. Tim Kaine, the incumbent, is going to be running - one assumes - for re-election again. And you've got to go out and find good candidates and sell them and sell them under the party banner.
A global investigation is shining new light on the shadowy business of offshore tax shelters. Over the weekend, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists released some 11 million documents.

Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., is planning to take his crusade against President Trump's tendency to play fast and loose with the truth to the Senate floor.
The leaders say they're waiting for Trump to outline his ideas for that in three weeks.
JAMES COMEY: That didn't make any sense to me. And although the law required no reason at all to fire an FBI director, the administration then chose to defame me and, more importantly, the FBI by saying that the organization was in disarray, that it was poorly led, that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader. Those were lies, plain and simple.

I debated three different people from Libre and all of them were very, very articulate in Spanish, says Parra. Five years ago, six years ago they would have put someone on the job based on their last name being Rodriguez.
Hillary Clinton's Trans-Pacific Partnership will be an even bigger disaster for the auto industry, believe me, even bigger and even worse than NAFTA. In fact, Ford Motor Company has announced its opposition to the deal. According to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. trade deficit with the proposed TPP member, all of the member countries has cost over 1 million manufacturing jobs in the year 2015.
House Democratic leaders outlined their legislation to rank and file members at a closed-door meeting Wednesday afternoon. The plan includes federally funded paid sick and family leave, an expansion of food security benefits for low-income families and other proposals to encourage people with symptoms to come forward and be tested, according to several Democrats in the meeting.
Beyond support for individuals and families — including an expanded child tax credit — the bill allocates billions of dollars to schools and to the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, testing and supplies. (Read more about what's in the bill here.)
Dr. POSEN: They're not quite as bad as people make them out to be. It's more Friday the 13th Part IV, than Friday the 13th Part I, but it's pretty darn bad. You've got a country that has everything going for it in terms of technology, property rights, stable government, and they still are unable to grow at a very strong rate.
YGLESIAS: I think it's a little strange, the emphasis that Trump is placing on the idea that he personally isn't under investigation, though. We already have a national security adviser who's in legal trouble for improperly documenting payments from foreign governments. We have Jared Kushner, a top presidential adviser who seems to have misstated his contacts on a security clearance form. We have Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, who seems to have made factual misstatements to Congress about his meetings with Russian officials. We have some kind of investigation of Paul Manafort, the former campaign chairman, for his financial dealings in Ukraine. And we have some questions around Michael Cohen, who was Trump's longtime lawyer.
A Treasury Department spokesperson said the new tax law cut taxes across the board, particularly for middle-income families. Most people are seeing the benefits of the tax cut in larger paychecks throughout the year, instead of tax refunds that are the result of people overpaying the government. Smaller refunds mean that people are withholding appropriately based on their tax liability, which is positive news for taxpayers.
And more than 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.
The site is considered one of the most valuable in the capital, and the developer will essentially be able to do with it as the company sees fit.
How they did it instead, was they added it as supplemental income on all of our paychecks, meaning it put some of us in a different tax bracket, meaning we got taxed at a higher percentage, Jeweler said. That means some people saw withholding for as much as $700 or $800, including Jeweler.

Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria – and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing. In Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames.
But despite supporting Trump, some in rural Idaho feel a disconnect with Washington today. The administration's preliminary budget released last year proposed a 20 percent overall cut to USDA, including deep cuts to some rural grant and loan programs. The skinny budget also proposed eliminating the agency that helped build the Orofino Business Park.
The threat of impeachment provides Republicans their best point of attack looking toward the midterm elections, and I think we're going to hear a lot more about it from their arsenal as they try to isolate the Robert Mueller investigation and delegitimize it, said Miringoff. If there's a silver lining for Republicans in this data, it's the impeachment question.

Trump Says Republicans Will Lose In 2018 If They Don't Support GOP Health Care Bill
ZARROLI: Well, Trump has, as you know, a large network of businesses all over the world, in the United States, in other countries. He has said until now that he is going to hand over the operations of these businesses to three of his grown children. I think the concern is there just are a lot of ways that the presidency will have an impact on these businesses.
What are they going to be able to repeal without 60 votes? says Robert L. Laszewski, president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates. The 60-vote rule suddenly works to their disadvantage.
What We Learned From Trump's State Of The Union Address
One more thorny issue states have to resolve in their ESSA plans: how to rate schools and explain those ratings to parents and politicians. Most of the early filers are using some form of four- or five-tier system, from the familiar A-F model (Tennessee) to Vermont's color-coded bull's eye scheme, with green schools hitting the mark and red schools off-target.
House Speaker Paul Ryan's office explained in an email that the IRS will adjust its withholding tables in February based on the legislation. At that point, for those likely to get a tax cut, employers would begin pulling less out of their paychecks for federal income taxes, also known as withholding. This means voters could start seeing the impact of the tax legislation on their pay stubs well before the congressional midterm elections next fall. Of course the withholding tables are just estimates, so voters' final tax burden for 2018 wouldn't be calculated until they file their tax returns in 2019.
GREENE: We'll have to stop there, sadly. That's journalist Jeffrey Barbee on the line from Zimbabwe. Thanks.
That means someone like Warren Buffett, who gets most of his income from stock investments, can pay a very low rate without triggering the AMT, while a well-paid executive from Westchester County with lots of kids probably can't.
GRAVES: That's correct. So paid sick was supported 73 percent to 16 percent - this is by CEOs from across the country, in each region of the country. Minimum wage increasing - it was supported 80 percent to 8. And what happens in this presentation that's on our site at PR Watch is during this webinar, when these poll findings are unveiled, these state lobbyists for the business community, state chamber lobbyists, are being told how to overcome this empathy.
In March 2017, Nikolai Gorokhov, the lawyer for Sergei Magnitsky, who was the source of reporting on Russia's largest tax fraud, fell from a fourth-story window while trying to move a bathtub. Russian authorities made that explanation with a straight face.

That economic strain is already evident in low birthrates and stalled labor force participation, Dunkley said.
A big part of President Biden's coronavirus relief package is focused on kids. The president says he wants to expand the federal child tax credit. That's a federal program that gives families money for each child they have - or at least it reduces their taxes. This change could help lift up to 10 million kids out of poverty, we're told. We spoke with Chuck Marr, who's director of federal tax policy at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, and he started by explaining what the child tax credit is now.
In Georgia, your secretary of state who, I can't believe this guy's a Republican. He loves recording telephone conversations. You know, that was? I thought it was a great conversation personally. So did a lot of other. People love that conversation because it says what's going on.
That's the gist of a report by The Los Angeles Times, which says nearly 10,000 soldiers are now scrambling to pay back signing bonuses that helped the Pentagon cope with the task of using an all-volunteer service to fight two prolonged international conflicts.
There's no doubt that Trump and House Republican leaders are interested in a border tax. The question is what kind. Trump wants to tax imports to punish individual countries, like Mexico, and pay for his border wall.

Not everyone at the New Hampshire meeting is as pessimistic about the future. Becky Whitley still plans to have a second child. She's with the advocacy group Moms Clean Air Force and says becoming a parent is precisely what motivated her to care about the climate.
Educators across Arizona walked out of their classrooms Thursday with a series of demands in hand, foremost among them a raise and a return to the school funding levels of a decade ago. And many of those walking out have descended on downtown Phoenix, where they are marching from Chase Field to a rally outside the state Capitol. Organizers expected from 30,000 to 50,000 teachers and their supporters to attend.

Many portions of Illinois House Bill 3653 will go into effect on July 1, however it will be another two years, January 2023, until the no cash bail policy is put in place.

Let's say you run a government agency in a low-income country and want to identify the poorest 10% of villages — or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito-borne diseases. Satellite imagery can help you answer those questions, Burke says, in a way that's much less expensive and time-consuming than traditional boots-on-the-ground surveys. Cars, large buildings and well-tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space.
Price says he followed all congressional ethics rules, but his well-timed trades made it appear that he could have used his position to influence the price of stocks he owned, or that he received special treatment from companies in which he invested.
Despite almost full employment nationwide, independents are particularly dissatisfied with Trump on the economy. That's likely driving much of their overall disapproval. Just 31 percent of independents say they have confidence in Trump's ability to improve the U.S. economy, while 49 percent doubt he can do so. Just three months ago, 44 percent thought Trump could turn around the economy, while 38 percent didn't — a whiplash-worthy 24-point swing.
That points to a much larger and more formidable problem for the economy, one that the U.S. and other advanced economies have struggled to explain.

HEATHER LONG: And can you say a little bit more about why?
POGGIOLI: Well, we're looking now at what was done in the north, where the first big restrictions were set in. And we saw police and soldiers were posted at train stations in Milan, stopping people who want to leave. They have to show the police form I mentioned giving the reasons why they want to leave. There have been cases - the newspapers today reported some cases of violators - two young women who said they had urgent need to go to Sicily but then when they got there, posted their photographs and, you know, bragged about breaking the cordon sanitaire. So they were reported to the police.
You know, she never wants a soldier brought home — I brought a lot of our soldiers home. I don't know, somewhat like it. They're in countries that nobody even knows the name, nobody knows where they are. They're dying. They're great, but they're dying. They're losing their arms, their legs, their face. I brought them back home, largely back home. Afghanistan, Iraq.

Trump signed several executive orders — an ethics order banning administration appointees from ever lobbying foreign governments and from federal lobbying for five years after they leave office. He also directed the administration to develop a comprehensive plan to defeat ISIS.
Engineering a good EV is not that hard, or at least it's not unheard of. Almost every single startup without fail underestimates the degree of challenge [in deployment], and the amount of time it takes, Sexton said. We root for all the startups, but a lot happens between concept and showroom, and it's most vulnerable for the startups.
Gale suspects people are more willing to pay taxes during periods when the government is seen as playing an important role.

We'd expect over 12,000 cases of obesity prevented by the end of the 10-year period, as well as $65 million in health care cost savings over the 10-year period, Michael Long, a researcher at GW, told us earlier this year. The evidence is clear, Long told us. When prices go up, people buy less of things.

But the fact is we're a city desperate for jobs and we're - already have disadvantages as compared to surrounding communities. We have high crime, a high tax burden, poor schools. And if you impose a financial burden on businesses that the surrounding communities don't have, it's going to be a disincentive for job growth. I'm just wondering - I'm sure that argument is made on a lot of these things - is there any data that tells us whether they're right?

For one thing, it would send interest rates on Treasurys soaring and destroy the U.S. Treasury's risk-free status. That's what Strain means by foundation; right now, everyone knows and trusts that U.S. debt is a safe investment. Treasurys are used in all sorts of financial transactions worldwide. They're in many people's retirement accounts as a low-risk asset. Rattling faith in that Treasury would introduce massive amounts of uncertainty into the economy.

66-year-old Blackburn has served in Congress since 2003, and is the first woman in the state to win a congressional seat without following a husband in the post. If elected, Blackburn would be the first woman from Tennessee to serve in the U.S. Senate. NPR's Jessica Taylor reported on Blackburn, She has long been a loyal conservative foot soldier and ticks off in her video the ways she would stand with President Trump — repealing the Affordable Care Act, backing the president's immigration ban and his border wall and his feud with the NFL over kneeling during the national anthem.

The American Civil Liberties Union, which was planning to sue over the order, changed course after reading the text, declaring the event an elaborate photo-op with no discernible policy outcome.
TRUMP: The future of this country has never been better. I wish the new administration great luck and great success. I think they'll have great success. They have the foundation to do something really spectacular. And again, we put it in a position like it's never been before, despite the worst plague to hit since, I guess you'd say 1917, over a hundred years ago.

TRUMP: You can see how loyal he is. He was begging for my endorsement. I could have said, Mitt, drop to your knees. He would've dropped to his knees.
President Trump has argued that those tax cuts are helping the economy, which in turn helps all Americans. The administration has said it hopes to increase the supply of affordable housing by providing tax incentives for construction in economically distressed areas, called opportunity zones, and by eliminating restrictive zoning laws.
ELVING: Unlike the first two rounds of these debates, even though there were 10 people on stage still, the way it was structured, the candidates each had a little bit more time to talk, a little more time for interchange and clarity. It seemed like - and more healthy energy. There was more energy. It was a slightly more positive energy with one or two exceptions. Almost all the candidates had some strong moments. Almost all of them had some weak moments. I thought Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren all helped themselves distinctively tonight. I didn't think Julian Castro on balance, although he had some strong moments, will come out of this stronger or Andrew Yang or, frankly, Kamala Harris, who continues to disappoint, perhaps in comparison to her one strongest performance in the first round of the debate.

Back in 2012, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's campaign suffered a blow when a tape was leaked of him grousing that 47 percent of Americans don't pay federal income tax. It was one of the biggest gaffes of the presidential campaign, but a new poll conducted by Ipsos for NPR suggests that many Americans forgot it.

And so I actually think that it'll be different this year in terms of who gets blamed. People do look to the person in the White House to resolve these disputes, to somehow slip in there with some great compromise. And they certainly expect that out of a guy who said he was the deal maker of the century, that he could cut every deal.
For example, right now it is perfectly legal, without question, for the government to collect every telephone call, every e-mail, every communication in the world — as long as it can claim credibly some part of the communication contains a person outside the United States, says Fred Cate, the director of the Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research at Indiana University. And that's a problem.

And there's something wrong with that. — Tamara Keith]
Before Donald Trump takes the oath of office in January, there are a lot of questions about how he will decide key policy issues.

Pomerantz said investors lost big while Trump claimed the tax benefits for himself: By doing that kind of very risky business — by being a gambler, if you will — he took an inappropriate risk for other people's money.
However, it's a virtual nonstarter in the Democratic-controlled House. Starting in 2019, families can withdraw up to $10,000 from 529 plans (essentially educational IRAs) to pay for private elementary and high schools, a version of school choice. That's due to an overhaul of the tax law in 2017 by the Trump administration. — Elissa Nadworny, reporter and editor for NPREd; and Anya Kamenetz, education correspondent
The demands that we stand up and support Trump and facilitate these sorts of actions became increasingly hostile and frightening, Evans said. And then when I saw the president tweeting for everyone to come to D.C. on the 6th, I thought, 'What is he doing?'

We need to get growth. And if you can get the economy moving, I think a lot of these other problems, like the deficit, become a lot easier to solve.

Trump Relives Campaign Victory During Thank-You Tour Rally
Long before Trump ran for president, he was known in New York City as a developer who was consummate at finding and obtaining these tax breaks, even when these tax breaks weren't specifically designed for his types of projects, says Nicole Gelinas, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.
Anzalone: In Bangladesh, India and Nepal every single year, things like bed nets [to keep away mosquitoes that can spread malaria and dengue], oral rehydration salts [to prevent diarrheal disease and cholera] can save a person's life.

Payments will go out in batches. The first batch will go to taxpayers who provided direct deposit information on their 2019 or 2020 tax returns. That will be followed by a second batch to taxpayers for whom the IRS already has payment info. For them, the payments could come in the form of checks or prepaid debit cards in the mail.
KING: That's right. Michigan has 125 delegates, like you said, the most. So what else is at stake today? What other states are big?
HASSETT: The same thing we saw last year, Steve (laughter). I mean, so about this time last year, we put out an economic report that had a forecast that we had actually finalized in November, before the tax cuts passed, and we modeled the number of policies that the President Trump team was going to push and found that the baseline growth forecast was about 2.2, which we agreed with the Obama administration on, but that if all of the policies were pursued last year, that we could get growth up to 3.1, and growth last year was 3.1. It was a pretty good hit.
Accurate info is crucial for determining how much college help students qualify for. Without it, applicants have to fill in their tax return data manually, which takes longer and is prone to error.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And we're not sure what it's going to - what exactly this bill's going to look like once it goes into reconciliation. I'm curious, Heather - Democrats were careful to keep their fingerprints off these bills in the House and the Senate, but there may have been parts they could've changed. Was that wise - sort of not engaging in this at all?

SHAPIRO: Is there an argument that this could have been more targeted? I mean, if these tax credits are going to families that make six figures, is it as effective as it could be if it were a little more narrowly tailored?
So at this point, all of this appears to be another show for Trump's public relations ahead of the 100-day marker, one he's calling a ridiculous standard, while at the same time launching a website touting all of his accomplishments.

As to other effects, the number of Americans without health insurance coverage would rise, the CBO says. Because the GOP proposals cut the tax penalty for not having insurance, it estimates that far fewer people would enroll in coverage. That, coupled with smaller subsidies to help lower- and middle-income people buy their own insurance and cuts to Medicaid, could lead to 22 million fewer insured Americans by 2026, the CBO says.
The juror continued, saying that we need, of course, to keep an open mind. It is our responsibility as a jury to hear everything and then reach our own conclusion.

But as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages pose an enormous danger to civilians and must be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence. That's the story ISIL wants to tell; that's the kind of propaganda they use to recruit. We don't need to build them up to show that we're serious, nor do we need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is representative of one of the world's largest religions. We just need to call them what they are – killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Figures in the White House. The president has, of course, reacted. He's been on a tweet tear this morning. But yesterday, what's getting a lot of focus is his tweet - or to be precise, the president's account showed a tweet - stating that he fired Flynn for lying to the vice president but also for lying to the FBI. There's been a lot of speculation that part of the tweet would indicate Trump knew Flynn had lied to law enforcement and still tried to protect him from prosecution. Do you think this is significant?
MANDEL: No, I think that from what I'm hearing sort of among people who have been sort of following this story is that this end of negotiations kind of caught the administration by surprise and that they didn't necessarily realize that they were pretty much out of time. And what is worrisome is not necessarily this round of tariffs but subsequent rounds of tariffs that really will hit the American consumer quite hard.
Zeroing out the individual mandate penalty should not result in striking important consumer protections that help guarantee coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, a written statement from the group said. Removing those provisions will result in renewed uncertainty in the individual market, create a patchwork of requirements in the states, cause rates to go even higher for older Americans and sicker patients, and make it challenging to introduce products and rates for 2019.

COHN: So I think it functions badly. And I think a fair amount of that is the way the sort of institutions of our government, especially the Congress, especially the Senate, are set up really thwart change and thwart progressive change in particular. And that is because of the sort of bias towards small states that's built into the way the Senate is designed. You know, a senator from Wyoming has the same amount of influence as a senator from New York. And because of the way the country's population is distributed, that pulls everything in a much more conservative direction. You throw the filibuster on that - so you actually need 60 votes, not 50, to pass something - and it's just very hard to do anything. And, you know, I think going forward, that's why I think progressives, if you're thinking about the future, how to pass reforms, they really need to attack those impediments to change or otherwise they're going to run into the same struggles that the Democrats of 2009 did.

The study found that 28 percent of black Protestants heard their clergy speak in support of Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign, while about 1 in 5 black Protestants, about 20 percent, said they had heard their ministers denounce Donald Trump.

And what we are seeing, though, is that, when you're talking about taking on incumbents who are so well-funded from corporations, it's very hard for people who don't either have another kind of public platform, or don't have a lot of personal wealth to put into the campaign, which is - I am not investing in my own campaign.

MARTIN: Can we just finally turn to that travel ban? The president limiting travel - banning travel from foreign nationals from Europe to the United States, exempting American citizens trying to get back home if they go through extra screening - but what would be the impact?

We reached out to every single organizing staffer in those six states as well as others and asked them to consider continuing this work through November, with the DNC, in those states or others the DNC is prioritizing, the statement said. Already, hundreds of former Bloomberg campaign staff have been contacted and are in the hiring pipeline to join the DNC organizing efforts — which would not have happened without this campaign's transfer of funds.
FAHRENTHOLD: The expectation with family foundations is that if your name is on the foundation, unless you're dead, it's your money that's being given away. And even if you are dead, it was your money before. And Trump has sort of turned that on its head.

Smaller but not insignificant cuts come from eliminating other taxes, including a limit — $2,600 this year — on how much workers can annually set aside tax-free in flexible spending accounts to pay for things like medications, eyeglasses or co-payments for doctor's office visits. The plans would also increase the amount people could put in tax-protected health savings accounts. The Senate proposal would also revert tax law back to pre-ACA days in setting the threshold for medical deductions at 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income; the ACA had boosted that to 10 percent. The House approach is even more generous.
The dangers of undershooting our response are far greater than overshooting it, Schumer said.

DAVIES: You've said one of his core beliefs is that America tries to do too much in the world, and he's made some pretty remarkable statements about welcoming new nuclear powers in the Far East, like Korea and Japan, suggesting that we might not live up to NATO obligations unless some of the nations pay more for American troops. Do the experts that you spoke to think he will actually do that? And even if he doesn't, what is talking that way - what's the impact of saying those things?

But after Monday's announcement, Trump said the company should be patient, noting, ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the E.U., which has hurt us badly on trade, down $151 Billion.
FOWLER: One of the things that they stuck in there was a jet fuel tax break for Delta and other airlines in the state. And what it would do is it would allow Delta to pay less for fuel taxes. And Republican Governor Nathan Deal hoped that that would bring more flights into Atlanta and more businesses into Atlanta and overall be better for the state. And that passed with little drama and little fanfare in the House until Delta decided to cut ties with the NRA. Many Republican lawmakers objected to Delta's treatment of the NRA. And Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle, who's a Republican, said I will kill any tax legislation that benefits Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with the NRA. Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back.
Meanwhile, lawsuits are playing out in several states, including one brought by Pennsylvania's attorney general accusing several gas companies of stiffing thousands of landowners by promising royalty money that was never paid. So far, he has not agreed to an offer by Chesapeake Energy to settle its royalty cases in the state for $30 million.

Two-thirds of Americans believe lower-income people pay too much income tax (with heavy partisan differences — around 8-in-10 Democrats, 6-in-10 independents, and half of Republicans agreed with that statement). In addition, 60 percent of Americans believe taxes should be lowered for people making $49,000 or less (again, with Democrats and independents being somewhat more likely than Republicans to say those taxes should be lowered).

HORSLEY: We know that a lot of the people who have suddenly seen their income cut off don't have a lot of savings to fall back on. So the goal here is to get money to them quickly so they can keep paying their bills and the damage to the economy doesn't just cascade further.
At the center of my plan is trade enforcement with China. This alone could return millions of jobs into our country. They break the rules in every way imaginable. China engages in illegal export subsidies, prohibited currency manipulation, and rampant theft of intellectual property. They also have no real environmental or labor protections, further undercutting American workers. Just enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions of American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would produce more than 2 million more jobs right here in the United States. Add to that the saved jobs from cracking down on currency cheating and product dumping, and we will bring trillions of dollars in new wealth and wages back to the United States.
Allowing insurers to offer non-Obamacare-qualified plans. This mirrors an idea that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Utah Sen. Mike Lee had proposed in recent weeks: The Senate's bill would allow an insurer to offer skimpier plans. As long as an insurer does offer a plan on the individual insurance exchanges that meets the demands of Obamacare's Title I (for example, covering certain areas like preventive care and protecting people with pre-existing conditions), that insurer will be allowed to offer additional plans off of the individual insurance exchanges that don't meet those criteria.
Lebanon is one of the most indebted nations in the world. For decades, the central bank serviced debt by offering high interest rates to attract capital.
Besides, he wrote, there never was a Republican 'Eastern Establishment' which could control Presidential nominations by raising or withholding campaign funds, though there were powerful and progressive Republicans who had been influential in nominating past candidates.
BOLTON: Well, you know, I mean, my personal opinion is I think, you know, he thinks about his own parents. He thinks about his dad, who, you know, who he has referenced, you know, owned, as Schumer calls it, a junky little exterminator business in Brooklyn growing up. And, you know, I think he's working to make a better life for him and other Americans, to make sure that there's opportunity for people.

SANDERS: Well, as I'm sure you know, the caucus and primary map up until this point has really favored the secretary because a lot of her victories, including her big victory in Mississippi yesterday, are in the deep South. So let me be very frank - we have not done well in the deep South, and it's not surprising. The south is a pretty conservative area. I'm not a conservative. But we have already won nine caucuses and primaries in New England. We've won them in the Midwest. We've won it in the Southwest. And it turns out that the caucuses and primaries that are now coming up in the future, I think, are looking pretty good for us. So you are looking at large states, like New York state, where we think we have a pretty good chance to win. You're look at the West Coast, where I think we have an excellent chance to win in California, Oregon, Washington state, Hawaii, smaller states like Montana and Idaho. So I think that the coming primaries and caucuses actually favor us. So the deep South was very good for Secretary Clinton, but I should also point out to you that a lot of those states in the deep South, unfortunately - I wish I could tell you otherwise - are probably not going to be won in the general election by Secretary Clinton or myself.

We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job. The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and together, we've increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, and boosted graduates in fields like engineering. In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing Pre-K for all, offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one, and we should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids.

There's been tremendous growth over the past 40, 45 years in the size of our criminal justice system, particular growth in the number of jails and the size of the jails. We've seen a fourfold increase in the jail population in the past 45 years, and along with that [has] been the construction of new and bigger jails. And the reality is, a lot of the communities that have built these jails don't have funds to support them. They're not supported by state tax revenue, by federal tax revenue. They're supported by local community budgets, and a lot of these places are not wealthy. They don't have a lot of money to cover it, and so the solution has been to try to get that money from the people who pass through the system.
If this proposal survives the wrangling in Congress and makes it to Biden's desk, experts say it could cut child poverty nearly in half.

And, you know, what was interesting was the premise of the Affordable Care Act when they kind of got - when the Democrats got power was they hoped that they crafted a plan that they thought had a lot of those elements and that looked like things conservatives had praised before in the hopes that that would get at least some Republican buy-in. And, of course, it didn't. And I think that's where you get into the other factors at play. Some of this was the Republican Party, the conservative movement in this country became more extreme in its opposition to the welfare state. And, you know, and this was a sort of ongoing change. A lot of this - you know, and then amplified by groups funded by the Koch brothers, for example.

Currently, unemployment stands at 6.7%, down from a high of 14.7% in April of last year. That's an improvement, but for context, the 14.7% was the highest since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began keeping statistics in 1948. The 6.7% would have been the worst since March 2014 — pre-pandemic, when the country was recovering from the Great Recession.

In addition, there is the highly troubling matter of Dominion Voting Systems. In one Michigan county alone, 6,000 votes were switched from Trump to Biden and the same systems are used in the majority of states in our country.
She acknowledges it's not a comfortable topic for discussion with her male colleagues. Kelly says they've been professional, but it's definitely not something they are eager to discuss over the lunch table
After the announcement of the ruling in the Hernandez case, the Supreme Court moved on to hearing arguments in another immigration case, but this one involved the First Amendment right of free speech.
EISBRENNER: You know, that's one - that's why, you know - they say how do you grade him on 1 to 10? And I say maybe 7.5. That's one of the little things there that - you know, that and his Twitter, I wish he would stop a little bit of that, you know, the reactionary part and, you know, talk to his advisers because sometimes just shooting from the hip, you end up shooting yourself in the foot.

MARTIN: So the White House has outlined this plan to help the economy, but yet it still doesn't seem to be helping the stock market. Can you explain what the plan is and why it's not helping on that?
Similarly, Kansas City, Mo.-based Hallmark has asked Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Roger Marshall of Kansas to return $7,000 and $5,000, respectively, in employee donations from the last two years, according to The Kansas City Star.

Each year thousands of people don't pay the taxes they owe. They claim all kinds of reasons from penury to protest. The Planet Money team brings us the story of Larry Williams who decided he just shouldn't have to pay his taxes anymore.
We have a huge wave of baby-boom era people retiring, says Robert J. Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University and author of The Rise and Fall of American Growth. Right now, we've got a shortage of construction workers. We've got a shortage of long-distance truck drivers. We've got a shortage of many kinds of skilled workers needed to work in manufacturing.
The spring sprint is on: Con artists are racing to defraud income taxpayers ahead of April's filing deadline, and the Internal Revenue Service is scrambling to stay one step ahead.
Most of Clinton's plans would require congressional support. And that would test the former secretary of state's negotiating skills, since the House of Representatives at a minimum is expected to remain in Republican hands.

Inspired by Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American to sit on the nation's highest court, she pursued a career in law to help right the wrongs she saw. That ambition would eventually take her from the San Francisco district attorney's office to the California attorney general's office to the Senate. Now she hopes it will take her to the White House. She's seeking to not only become the first woman to be president, but the first black woman.
Also helping turbocharge growth is how President Biden's plan is structured, according to experts.
My budget before the pandemic came around was on a shoestring, she said.
In fact, many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative. This brings me to the second big question we have to answer as a country: how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges?
How Donald Trump Lost $916 Million
Read and hear the original story from NPR's Weekend Edition.
Trump questioned, via Tweet, Congress' priorities. He tweeted a pair of posts saying that while the OCE was unfair, Congress had more important issues to take up, including tax reform and health care.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah, Dave. But even so, I mean, this was an area that went very staunchly Republican in the last election. It was a very tight race.
CLINTON: ...That he didn't pay any taxes. Well, what kind of genius loses a billion dollars in the first place?
It is not acceptable that, in communities throughout the country, wealthy developers are gentrifying neighborhoods and forcing working families out of the homes and apartments where they have lived their entire lives, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who's running for the Democratic nomination, wrote recently in the Las Vegas Sun.
Her husband is a mechanical engineer, and she works in sales part-time. To afford educational opportunities for her high-school-aged son, she also picks up odd jobs within the gig economy.
In fact, about one-quarter of all the doctors and nurses in the U.S. are immigrants.
I have difficulty putting that much energy into discussing this budget document because this is some of the most meaningless work that we do here, Corker said with a sigh. It has nothing to do with the chairman or the committee. It's a waste of time.
Who Is The Senate Parliamentarian Who Ruled Against A Minimum Wage Increase?
And when the annual Conservative Political Action Conference is held later this month, it will be with theme: America Uncanceled.
When it was first discovered, that scandal was deemed war profiteering and was said to have benefited guard members who hadn't logged any combat duty; high-ranking officers were mentioned. But in the years since, lower-ranking service members have complained about garnished checks and a prolonged review process, saying they've done nothing wrong.
In 2016, Clearwater County voted 75 percent for Donald Trump, compared to just 18 percent for Hillary Clinton. The tallies were similar in surrounding counties that are also heavily dependent on timber.
Our office carefully developed a process with local judicial partners to implement Amendment 4 as the voters wanted in accordance with state and federal law, Warren said. We are committed to ensuring that the inability to pay outstanding fines and fees is not a roadblock to have voting rights restored. Any suggestion to the contrary reveals a troubling lack of understanding of our process, Amendment 4, and the U.S. Constitution.
It's worth talking about because it already is a politically powerful idea among Democrats.
KING: OK. So the military is offering their reasoning for doing this, as Steve said - the results of an election that they don't like, disagree with. What are the - what specifically are they charging?
The lives of millions of people in our region are undergoing radical change. There is quite simply a new reality, Kluge said in a briefing that was held in a U.N. building that has been nearly completely abandoned as workers stay home to practice social distancing.

But the idea was to have a sort of optional government-run program for people who want to go into it and that this program would, you know, would work like Medicare works and, because of that, you know, in principle, in theory, would be more efficient. It would be cheaper. So it'd be a cheaper option for people. And, also, it would, you know, introduce some new competition - right? - for the private sector 'cause if you're a private insurer and you're competing with this public insurance option that's cheaper, you're going to lower your rates, too. That did not make it into the bill. It is not part of the law. Biden has said he wants to have one of those.
I even pulled my kids by their ears saying, 'You're voting,' and they tell me 'Ma, my vote don't count.' I say 'That's a lie, Every vote counts,'  says Genas.

Trump: Payroll Tax Cuts And Hourly Worker Relief Possible In Coronavirus Response
About half of the poll's respondents (with very little variance by party) said they believe 75 percent of the federal government's revenue comes from personal income taxes. In reality, it's just under half.
So we will fight to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for everyone.
One positive thing Trump could do to make America great again is to actually make great things in America again.
DEMBOSKY: A consortium of pro-choice groups promised to pay for all the required ultrasound equipment and training costs of providing the abortion pill on campus. But eventually, universities would likely need to dip into tax dollars or student fees for ongoing costs. Abortion opponent Michele LaMonica told protesters that's not right.
On average, state revenue has mostly recovered. And the key reason for that is that income has mostly recovered, said Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The economy is doing much better right now than we thought it was going to be doing early in the pandemic.
ROMNEY: He creates scapegoats of Muslims and Mexican immigrants. He calls for the use of torture. He calls for killing the innocent children and family members of terrorists. He cheers assaults on protesters. He applauds the prospect of twisting the Constitution to limit First Amendment freedom of the press. This is the very brand of anger that has led other nations into the abyss.
Romney's plan would eliminate the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC), the state and local tax deduction and the head of household tax filing status. He also proposed trimming the Earned Income Tax Credit.
DAVIES: You know, last year, you wrote about white nationalist groups that have embraced Trump, and they feel he's expanded their reach, given them some legitimacy and, of course, since the election there have been some very troubling cases of swastikas, racist graffiti, some assaults racist hate speech. You know, some would see this as just a fringe that is an embarrassment to most Republicans and conservatives I'm wondering what you make of this and what the impact will be of Trump being in the White House?
TOLSON: I think he handled it pretty well. It seemed pretty diplomatic and step by step, following a process that seemed to already be in place.

The outbreak has caused turmoil in the stock market. Monday was Wall Street's worst day in more than a decade. After the markets closed, President Trump said he's going to ask Congress for help.
The campaign is now targeting the battleground states of New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada, Virginia and Colorado, putting Trump on the air in a total of nine states. The campaign rolled out its first set of ads earlier this month in Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio and North Carolina.
There's also a major age gap in those who want to remove Trump through the most extreme measures versus those who don't — 57 percent of voters under 30 support impeachment, but 55 percent of those 60 and older oppose it.
Of course, a great education isn't all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security. After all, it's not much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place, with a health and retirement package, for 30 years, are sitting in this chamber. For everyone else, especially folks in their forties and fifties, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher. Americans understand that at some point in their careers, they may have to retool and retrain. But they shouldn't lose what they've already worked so hard to build.
For a church, while the clergyman is giving a sermon, the clergyman might speak on behalf of a particular political candidate. It does not mean that the church is free to hold a fundraiser on behalf of that candidate. So that is not going to change the character of a charity unless the provision is abused.
RICK PLUTA, BYLINE: Trump won Michigan by a fraction of a percentage point, but that was enough to put the state's 16 electoral votes in the Republican column. It was also the first time the GOP candidate won the state since 1988. The president did not forget that last December when he was in the city of Battle Creek for a rally.
And she says that could be what's needed to address a problem as daunting as climate change.
Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism of our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.
And that's why I take it personally. My dad ran a printing plant. He had two really long tables. He printed fabric for draperies. He would lay out the fabric and then he would take a silkscreen and he would go down the table, he'd put the silkscreen down, he'd pour the paint in, he'd take the squeegee, he'd go across the screen, he'd lift it up, he'd go down all the way to the end and then he'd start on the other table. He worked hard. And then when he finished, he would load all that fabric up, put it in his car, and take it to the business that had ordered it - maybe a restaurant, or a hotel or some office. He expected to be paid when he showed up. He did the work. He paid for the supplies and the labor that he often hired to help him on big jobs. He expected to be paid. I can't imagine what would have happened to my father and his business if he had gotten a contract from Trump. And showing up and submitting his bill had been told we're not going to pay and if you don't like it, sue us. My father never could have sued a big organization like that. I just don't understand it.
He was basically saying this is bad for the whole Republican agenda. If we don't make it on this one, which we spoke about so much, then it hurts us on everything going forward, said King.

Then election officials pull boxes, Democrats, and suitcases of ballots out from under a table. You all saw it on television, totally fraudulent. And illegally scanned them for nearly two hours, totally unsupervised. Tens of thousands of votes. This act coincided with a mysterious vote dump of up to 100,000 votes for Joe Biden, almost none for Trump. Oh, that sounds fair. That was at 1:34 a.m.
It's too late to fix these problems for this election, but a look to the social networks of tomorrow might offer some hope.
Trump has proposed massive cuts to aid in each of his budget proposals. Congress, which holds the power of the purse, has ignored those past requests.

If we want Hungarian children instead of immigrants and if the Hungarian economy can generate the necessary funding, then the only solution is to spend as much of the funds as possible on supporting families and raising children, the prime minister was quoted as saying by the BBC.
Not doing either is odious, wildly unpopular and something no congressional leader wants. To put it bluntly — and smart congressional aides and leaders know this — faltering on either would be political TNT for the GOP and Trump.

The issue the Fed — and all of us, really — have been facing is that the neutral rate has been falling and falling and falling, since even before the financial crisis. That's why the Fed is finding itself having to lower the interest rates under its influence now — even this far into an economic expansion. The fact that the neutral rate is so low is a reflection of a fundamental economic issue: there's a big supply of savings floating out there, but there's nowhere near the demand for investment. And that lack of investment is bad news for economic growth.
Initially, the online calculator that the federal Department of Health and Human Services provided to help large employers gauge compliance with the minimum value standard gave the green light to plans that didn't cover hospitalization services or more than a few doctor visits a year. Now plans must provide at least that coverage to meet federal standards.

Trump touched on nationalistic themes, vowing that from now on it's going to be America first. Never again, Trump vowed, will anyone's interest come before the interests of the American people. It's not going to happen.
JEROME POWELL: You are hearing concerns from people, for example, in the travel business or the hotel business and things like that. We expect that will continue. It will probably grow. And that's one of the reasons why we've come to the view that it would be appropriate for us today to move to support the economy. And that's what we've done.
Americans overestimate how important income taxes are to government revenue
But there is a reason a tax overhaul hasn't happened for more than 30 years. And infrastructure went nowhere in the Obama years after the stimulus plan — despite an economic collapse and a willingness on both sides to do it. It failed because Democrats and Republicans couldn't agree on how to pay for it.
A spokesman for Manafort, Jason Maloni, said he is responding to government inquiries.

During an earlier stint at the Justice Department, in 1995, Garland traveled to Oklahoma City after a bombing at the federal building there killed 168 people. His colleagues credited him with helping to build a meticulous trail of evidence that helped convict Timothy McVeigh and his co-conspirator, Terry Nichols. That experience, as well as his cool head during a later standoff with the Montana Freemen, could help inform his approach to the current wave of extremism.

SHAPIRO: When you were governor, you negotiated to keep this Electrolux refrigerator plant in Michigan. You brought your cabinet to the town. You offered this incredible package of tax incentives. You laid it all on the table, and the plant said, sorry, we're going to Mexico anyway. The lesson of that seems to be these negotiations don't necessarily work. I mean what's the moral of the story there?
ELVING: That is a good point.
The upshot, though, is that many jobs in what Holzer calls the new middle may not quite require a college degree, but they will require more training than a high school diploma. One potential solution, he said, could be encouraging businesses to train their workers better. Apprenticeships could be another big part of this, as Claire Cain Miller wrote recently at the New York Times.

Mukuria is the founder of ZanaAfrica Foundation, which delivers health education — and sanitary pads — to help girls stay in school. A girl who is embarrassed to stain her uniform (or has an infection) is one who is likely to skip class and eventually drop out, Mukuria explains. UNESCO estimates that more than 2 million Kenyan girls need support in order to get menstrual hygiene products.

My mom posted our wedding photos online. I'm not sure if she had the right to that under our photographer's contact, Rose offers by way of example. No one is reading those.
Cash transfers have also been gaining momentum as a mechanism to reduce poverty. The idea is that recipients know best how to spend the money — whether on meals, school fees, health care or whatever else they need most — to lift themselves out of poverty or keep themselves from falling into it. India, Kenya, Finland and other countries have also been exploring the idea of providing cash stipends for all citizens (or a universal basic income) as a social safety net to reduce inequality. The stipends are usually not enough to live on, but a couple of hundred dollars a month, while pocket change for a millionaire, could mean never missing rent for someone living paycheck to paycheck.

And so when Buttigieg jumped in to be critical of it and to, in a sense, implicitly defend Biden...
In Pennsylvania, the Democrat secretary of state and the Democrat state Supreme Court justices illegally abolished the signature verification requirements just 11 days prior to the election.
If there's a chance to buy back debt at a discount, interest rates up and the bonds down, and you can buy debt. That's what I'm talking about, he said, as reported by Politico.
And then late in the evening, or early in the morning, boom, these explosions of bull****.
--Fit on a postcard? Trump's Treasury secretary said this plan would seek to simplify the tax code by allowing people to fill out their taxes on a large postcard. While people always like the idea of making it easier to fill out their taxes, they might not like what benefits they'd potentially lose. It could mean doing away with popular deductions like the home mortgage deduction, something that back in December Mnuchin said Trump's plan would scale back.
The night was also marked by tension among delegates on the floor of the Wells Fargo Center. When Tim Kaine was — by acclamation — officially nominated as the party's vice presidential candidate, supporters of Bernie Sanders chanted that they wanted a roll call vote.
America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just one year — isn't it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a permit approved for a simple road? Trump will ask Congress.

The problem is all that money — and whether donors were motivated by anything other than pure goodwill and philanthropy. Namely: whether they gave because of the promise of access to and favors from Hillary Clinton, who was just beginning her career in public office at the time that Bill Clinton had ended his.
This is of great concern to Chris Mayer, a housing economist at Columbia University, who agrees that this current approach to building affordable housing may not be the most efficient one. My fear with this tax bill is that we're going to cut the affordable housing subsidies but we're not going to replace them with a more efficient program, Mayer says. That means what we're doing on net is cutting subsidies for low-income people, making it more expensive for them to live — we end up with more people homeless and more families struggling in this country.

The numbers look bleaker a decade out for most American households. To help ensure their bill met the budget limits Republicans had set for themselves, lawmakers set many individual income tax changes to sunset after 2025 (however, they made cuts to corporate tax rates permanent).
MARTIN: What is your sense of what motivated that shift? And, you know, I do want to point out, a lot of people think it's because the mob invaded the Capitol. But as you point out in your piece, actually, he finally accepted the election results - belatedly, but strongly and decisively - before that happened. So what do you think was the cause of that shift?

SIEGEL: Adam Posen, thank you very much for talking with us.
Perhaps Trump's easiest action — and the one that would produce the largest impact — would be to drop the administration's appeal of a lawsuit filed by Republican House members in 2014. That suit, House v. Burwell, charged that the Obama administration was unconstitutionally spending money that Congress hadn't formally appropriated, to reimburse health insurers who were providing coverage to working-poor policyholders — those earning between 100 and 250 percent of the federal poverty line.
BURGESS: I happened to be actually at the Conor Lamb event whenever the results were coming in, and it was a roller coaster night to say the very least. I did follow it all night. Yes.
South Korea in particular is a major economic player and a big supplier of components used by manufacturers around the world. The U.S. imported nearly $80 billion worth of goods from South Korea last year. Along with China and Japan, the country is a key supplier of computer and electronics products, fabricated metal products, and machinery.
I have worked alongside nine presidents, Republican and Democrat, all experienced, all believing in the U.S. role in world leadership and I can tell you this — that in this election, there is only one candidate for president who has the experience, the temperament, and the judgment to be commander in chief. And that's Hillary Clinton, he said before the chants began.
Aside from inflicting damage to the exchanges, the administration could also affect the law's operations by refusing to approve states' changes to their Medicaid programs. States rely on federal regulators to sign off on changes large and small, including which citizens are eligible, to keep their Medicaid programs operating. There are so many things that an administration that doesn't want a program to work can do, Rosenbaum said.
NPR has learned that the 2020 White House budget set to be released Monday will call for increased spending on child care and propose an initiative to address shortages.
Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell says there was a political component to the decision, especially since it's widely expected President Trump's speech will serve as the launch of his reelection campaign.
WEAVER: Well, yes. I mean, a majority of the House Democrats support single-payer. We've also got to tackle the issue of immigration in this country. We need comprehensive immigration reform. We need a path to citizenship for 11 million people who are in the country. We need to make sure that families are never ripped apart at the border again. And I do think that Democrats should put forward a bold jobs/infrastructure program that would put millions and millions of people back to work all across this country, rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and show that electing Democrats, in fact, will enhance the economic life of every person in this country and every zip code. And when we do that, we need to make sure that that package includes appropriate protections so that communities that have previously been left out receive their fair share of the benefits.
NPR reached out to Wareham for response.
BEARDSLEY: Yes. I mean, actually, nothing Macron can say will satisfy them. And they say life is not going to stop in France because Notre Dame burned. And so they want to hear from him.

What happens if the legislature does do something and it's still not good enough for the advocates? asks Loren Furman, senior vice president of state and federal relations for the Colorado Chamber of Commerce, which has been supportive of a paid leave bill. Are they then going to continue down the path of the ballot initiative?
Eliminating deductions like this are what make room for big items like the corporate tax cut — and remember, it's all connected. Tax cuts tend to increase the federal deficit, and congressional rules limit how much Republicans can do that. So a tax cut in one part of the economy may need to be offset by higher taxes in another.
Gavin Ekins, a research economist with the conservative leaning Tax Foundation, says it's OK that the scales are tipped toward machines. In the long run it's better for the economy, he says.

HORSLEY: No. He has been keeping the inspector general busy. There were questions raised earlier this year about his overreliance on pricey first-class airline tickets. The EPA initially said he needed to fly first class because he was getting hostile threats from the unruly crowds back in coach. Pruitt, though, has since said he will fly coach on occasion and rely on his security detail to look after him. The administrator, by the way, enjoys round-the-clock security, which is unusual for somebody in his position.
The party is suffering in the meantime. The same Quinnipiac poll found congressional Democrats had just a mediocre job approval. But Republicans' ratings were abysmal.
Snapchat has emerged as the social network of the future. Data from Public Opinion Strategies find that more than 60 percent of U.S. smartphone owners ages 18 to 34 are using Snapchat and that on any given day, Snapchat reaches 41 percent of all 18- to 34-year-olds in the U.S. Any hope for the social media discourse of the future may be found with them.
So far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short-term needs — like giving their families enough food each day — rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way. But these families were also able to give their children more schooling. And now that the kids are aging into the workforce, it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty. If so, says Evans, that will be an exciting thing to find. — Nurith Aizenman
[Personal and Chapter 11 corporate bankruptcies aren't entirely comparable, as this 2009 NPR piece explains. Personal bankruptcy often results in discharging debt — it's a declaration that the filer has nothing left to pay (one aside here: discharging student debt via personal bankruptcy is phenomenally difficult). Chapter 11 bankruptcy, meanwhile, is about restructuring debt but keeping the business going. As many outlets have pointed out, it can be considered a good business decision. However, for example, the Washington Post reported earlier this year that financial experts have questioned whether the Taj Mahal bankruptcy was indeed a fantastic deal. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

But the prime minister's decision to launch an attack against Soros and the civil society he supports comes as little surprise to Botond Feledy, senior fellow at the Center for Euro-Atlantic Integration and Democracy in Budapest. He said the strategy is one that has worked well for populists across Central Europe: shift voter attention away from domestic issues by finding a foreign boogeyman.
HORSLEY: And that's sort of where Trump is today. But polls suggest voters aren't buying that. You know, we have the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office which says Obamacare is not in a death spiral.

So I'm back and forth in New Hampshire a lot, and it's been a lot of fun to be here. You know, it's given me a chance to talk about why I'm in this race for president. I see in America it's working great for rich people. It's working great for the billionaires and the corporate executives and the lobbyists. But it's just not working for much of anyone else.

I guess somebody swallowed the propaganda in Kansas City, and I hope they're not suffering too badly from it because those benefits that were projected aren't coming forth, says Katherine Kitty Smith Evans, director of government relations for the American Economic Association.
FURMAN: I think the administration should be focused on job growth, wage growth. And in particular, we have much less of a short-term problem now because we have a 4.1 percent unemployment rate. So I think the administration should be more focused on making sure that that growth is sustainable for the medium and long run, for example, without skyrocketing deficits and also making sure that we're increasing our productivity growth by, for example, making investments in infrastructure, education and the other things you need to undergird stronger growth over time.
I just was given a short but exciting tour by Mark Jurcak and John Couch, who were telling me about how this company, what started as and for most of its early history, was an auto supply company. And then in 2000 as the market began to change and some of the auto companies began to realign, they were faced with a choice. We all face choices in life, don't we? And this company could have just said hey, you know, our business is not going to be what it was. We've got to just fold up. Let's, you know, just kind of quit. But that's not what happened here. And what happened here is what can happen across America. You are in now what is largely an aerospace company, and because of the workforce and the work ethic and the commitment of Futuramic, you are seeing the future unfold. So, I got to see what's happening here to help build the SLS rocket, that is going to go from Macomb to Mars.
As she's talked about the economy, Clinton has faced a couple of challenges; convincing white working class voters that she feels their pain and condensing her five point economic plan into something simple, catchy and satisfying.
Every president tries to burnish his legacy by highlighting perceived successes in the final days, said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who worked on Republican Sen. Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign. Trump's problem among many is that this trip will be completely overshadowed by the fallout from last week.

The measure now moves to the Illinois House, which like the Senate is heavily controlled by Democrats. Pritzker has not taken a public position on the bill.
This all means that the new version doesn't make major changes to one big part of the BCRA: Medicaid. Under the original Senate bill, the Obamacare Medicaid expansion would be rolled back, and Medicaid spending would be capped — states would either be allotted a certain amount per capita, or they could get a block grant instead. It also caps Medicaid spending growth in the medium-to-long-term. This bill doesn't change any of that.
Just a year or two later, the topic of term limits has once more begun to permeate conversations in Russia. Last month, during Putin's annual marathon news conference in Moscow, the president took a question about the constitutional term limit and noted — in a nod to supporters who would like to see him remain in office past 2024 — that it troubles some of our political analysts and public figures.
It's certainly interesting and opens up a lot of lines of questioning, said John Quigley, director of the Center for Environment, Energy, and Economy at Harrisburg University and a former state environmental secretary.
Biden's plan also calls for hiring 100,000 additional public health workers, and a more robust surveillance system to watch for new and challenging mutations of the virus.

So we're talking about tens of thousands of potential asylum-seekers remaining in Guatemala. And U.S. officials say this is the best way for them to be safe, requesting protection in the first country they step into, rather than risking their lives in the hands of expensive smugglers taking them all the way to the U.S. For Guatemala, looks like they've secured a deal where citizens can come legally to work in U.S. farms under an expanded guest worker program that authorities say could start as soon as next week. But the agreement is expected to face legal challenges in the U.S. and especially in Guatemala, where its high court had banned the president from signing such a deal.
And yesterday we had — when we were in — and somebody brought up something political, that juror told the judge. And I said, 'We're not doing this,'  the juror said.

Second of all, you are quite right in saying that we did well in Michigan yesterday because of our trade position. NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations with China have cost us millions of decent-paying jobs.

ELVING: We have not had such hearings. There were hearings by a special committee set up in the Senate, even though impeachment would eventually begin in the House. But in the summer of 1973, the Senate held a series of extraordinary hearings in which they began the real exploration of Watergate that led to the revelation that there were tape recordings from the Oval Office in the White House that eventually provided the evidence that made it impossible for President Nixon to continue.

The company also faced rebuke from conservatives when it tried to share trending news stories on users' homepages; they said the shared articles reflected a liberal bias.

HORSLEY: Well, after their conference call this morning, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other finance ministers promised to use all the appropriate tools - and that includes having federal governments pump money into their economies the way they did during the Great Recession. President Trump tweeted last night, lawmakers should consider a payroll tax holiday - something that was done during the recession. So far, though, there's been no follow-up on that idea from the White House and little talk on Capitol Hill.
The Takeaway: Despite stricter requirements from the Affordable Care Act and the IRS to make nonprofit hospitals proactively educate patients about the various forms of financial relief they offer, the onus still remains on patients. If you have trouble paying a bill, call the hospital and ask for a copy of its financial assistance policy and the application to request your bill be discounted or excused.

The Biden administration is promising to spend $50 million on outreach and education to get the word out about the new special enrollment period. That's critical, experts say. Though the number of people signing up for Affordable Care Act plans has generally remained robust, the number of new consumers enrolling in the federal marketplace has dropped every year since 2016, according to KFF, corresponding to funding cuts in marketing and outreach. (KHN is an editorially independent program of KFF.)
But look, the problem that many Republicans have with Trump is not just that he hasn't been in the trenches - he wasn't a Republican. And so they, you know, they're not at all sure where he is ideologically. And, you know, you have - it's interesting that Margaret Hoover is the person making these statements, you know, the descendent of a president who was roundly defeated, but the party lived on. And I think that that is kind of the model that they're looking at with Ted Cruz.

We're living in the Upside Down. You know, like that shadowy land in Stranger Things, where the laws of physics don't apply and monsters might eat you. It's an alternate dimension where economic textbooks are being thrown out the window. A scary place where despite big deficits and easy money, the economy is slowing down to a rate below historical averages and wage growth remains disappointing. And it's a place where frightening monsters, or demogorgons, continue to scare away investment and productivity. Slaying these monsters is the key to growth and prosperity, but we seem to be stuck in this new world where investment and productivity will not come roaring back. Can we escape?

Summers warns that this world of disappointing growth and super-low interest rates means it will be hard for traditional tools, like the Fed's cutting of interest rates, to rescue us from future recessions.

I don't see him playing well in many states coming forward, Wareham said, perhaps more hopeful than anything else, as polls in upcoming GOP primary states give Trump an early edge in many states.

There are a whole lot of questions still about how President Trump and GOP lawmakers are going to pull off what the president calls a, quote, middle-class miracle.
On the other hand, it changes a lot of tax deductions - gets rid of some popular deductions like capping the state and local tax deduction and restricting it to property taxes not income taxes anymore. It gets rid of the medical expense deduction for high out-of-pocket medical costs. And perhaps most importantly for a lot of families, it changes the way in which you can deduct your kids, yourself. And so a lot of families - it replaces that with a child tax credit. And for a lot of families in the middle class, that could end up with a tax hike, several million families per our calculations.
A 2011 consumer survey cited by the lawmakers found that eight in 10 consumers were laboring under the misconception that disposable cups were being recycled, and that most consumers tried to discard their cups in recycling bins.

Pence's replies were a demonstration in the fine art of giving a long response that doesn't answer the question.
Week In Politics: Michael Cohen, Mueller, Rosenstein
Manafort had agreed to cooperate with the Mueller investigation after initially pleading guilty. But the plea deal fell apart after Jackson ruled earlier this month that he intentionally lied to Mueller's office, the FBI and the grand jury in his case. The ruling meant prosecutors were no longer bound by the plea deal.
The IRS Data Retrieval Tool won't be usable until October, an Education Department official has testified.
Many female chefs believe that offering mentorships and apprenticeships, as well as having women and women of color in leadership positions, is critical to establishing equal opportunities within the workplace and policies that provide more work-life balance. And organizations like the James Beard Foundation and Les Dames d'Escoffier have established programs aimed specifically at helping women advance within the culinary industry.
They're the same promises he made about another scheme called Trump Institute. The New York Times reports that the lessons it sold for thousands of dollars apiece were plagiarized from somebody else.
SHAPIRO: Since your victory, you sent out a handful of fundraising e-mails, and I'm curious how much you have raised off of last night's Michigan win.
Pack did the same with three other non-profit networks funded by USAGM and made himself board chairman over Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty; Radio Free Asia; and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks. He sought to force the networks to sign binding contracts ensuring that the boards could not be removed for two full years for any cause, and that board members could only be removed for cause subsequently, even though Biden aides have made clear he intends to replace Pack promptly.
Largely because of Republicans, record numbers of Americans are now calling themselves independents and saying a third party is needed.

Congressional Democrats say they've heard Biden's calls for bipartisanship, but they're setting up a budget work-around — just in case.
In addition to renewable energy tax credits, Greenstone says the federal government should invest in electric vehicle charging infrastructure and deploying batteries to store electricity from intermittent sources like the sun and wind.
And what I'm asking is to understand who is responsible for this. And I'm asking for Governor Cuomo to actually come out and say that this is completely false and that this was wrong and that he apologizes on behalf of his New York Democratic Party.
More people say they feel worse off — 40 percent — since Trump took office, than better off — 34 percent. There is a deep partisan divide on that question, of course — 73 percent of Republicans say they're better off, while 67 percent of Democrats say the opposite. Among independents, far more — 44 percent — say they're worse off, compared with just 27 percent who say they're better off.
SNELL: And those extraordinary measures seem like they will move as quickly as possible - with the reminder that the Senate, by nature, just moves slowly. So this is not a fix we're expecting to see today, tomorrow, maybe even days later.
Just like the suppression polls that said we're going lose Wisconsin by 17 points. Well, we won Wisconsin. They don't have it that way because they lost just by a little sliver. But they had me down the day before, Washington Post/ABC poll, down 17 points.
Research suggests that investing money to lift kids out of poverty, especially young children, has enormous long-term benefits.
After all, once a Trump or a Cruz or a Sanders is in the White House, he'd be The Man.
MARTIN: So if your pattern is that you tend to, say, go out on Thursday night every two weeks when you get paid, what might happen?
YDSTIE: We don't know for sure. But remember, AT&T wants to buy Time Warner, but the Trump administration is blocking that deal in court. So AT&T could be thinking that saying the tax cut motivated the company to pay big bonuses to workers might just get the Trump administration to ease its opposition to the deal.
NPR's politics team has annotated Clinton's speech below. Portions we commented on are highlighted, followed by analysis, context and fact check in italics.
It's not exactly news that Donald Trump doesn't like the media. But recently, he's been taking that sentiment to new heights - or lows, depending on your perspective. Here he was Tuesday at a press conference, setting, perhaps, a new standard for a presidential candidate's relationship with reporters.
Biden Sets Goal Of July 4th To 'Mark Independence' From Coronavirus
Being the quick-thinking entrepreneur that he was, O'Regan convinced the Irish government to create a tax loophole. And thus, duty free stores were born. Today on the show, we follow the surprising origin of duty free, and try to answer the question: Are they really saving you any money?
So what we find when you look back over the course of national security history is that the people who have interfered with a president's ability to use nuclear weapons, it's been individuals. It's been people who essentially acted out of their own judgment or conscience to do so. There's a couple examples. You know, to give you one, under President Nixon, Nixon actually asked his secretary of defense at the time, Melvin Laird, to put the United States on nuclear high alert.
I think we've missed an opportunity in the United States for many years at this point to have a discussion about our social safety net, said Matthew Slaughter, a Dartmouth economist who worked in the George W. Bush Administration. In some basic sense the narrative for why trade and globalization are good is lost right now. So what happens come January, 2017?
In its report, the World Health Organization points to systematic reviews of policies aimed at improving diet and preventing lifestyle diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. The evidence was strongest and most consistent for the effectiveness of sugar-sweetened beverage taxes in the range of 20-50% in reducing consumption, the WHO's meta-review concludes.
If spent well, it could have made a huge difference, Wareham told Morning Edition in defense of the former candidate. And he did everything that a candidate could possibly do. This concept that he was low energy is despicable. Nobody in this race had more time commitment, more energy than Jeb Bush.
It's the biggest deficit reduction we will be able to vote on in this Congress, and other Congresses as well, said Steny Hoyer (D-MD), the House majority leader.

Ekins says some machines kill jobs, but others create jobs. If you buy a backhoe, for example, people have to build it and someone has to drive it. And he says incentives for training programs would be great to have down the road if Congress would design effective ones and pass them into law.
MARTIN: So let's just start at the beginning. Senator Schumer has been in government a long time. He was elected to Congress in 1980 when he was 29. He went to the Senate in 1998. He served in the New York Assembly before that. How did he rise up to the position of Senate majority leader? Were there any key turning points?

On his first day, Biden rejoined the Paris climate accord, which Trump pulled out of. He appointed former Secretary of State John Kerry to be the first-ever U.S. climate envoy, a post Biden made Cabinet level. He wants to invest $2 trillion in renewable energy and retrofitting infrastructure; put the U.S. on a course to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050; and incentivize Americans to move away from using cars where possible and more toward public transportation.
OK, so where are we? The House has passed a bill. The Senate Finance Committee has passed a bill. But the whole Senate actually passing something and working this all out and getting something to President Trump's desk still seems uncertain.
And Kelly Loeffler, I'll tell you, she has been, she's been so great. She worked so hard. So let's give her and David a little special hand because it was rigged against them. Let's give her and David.

But in our poll, nearly half of Democrats — 45 percent — agreed with the proposition that federal income taxes should be cut for all income levels.
That would mean a smaller deficit than the record $3.1 trillion in 2020, according to the forecast issued by the Congressional Budget Office on Thursday. But at $2.3 trillion, the budget gap in 2021 would still top 10% of the overall U.S. economy — making it the second-largest deficit since World War II.
BROWN: It was taxes to beat the Axis of evil.
Growth in emerging markets is also accelerating. The broad increase in global growth is one reason U.S. stock indexes have risen to record highs even as the dollar is retreating. Global growth boosts the demand for U.S. goods, lifting the fortunes of American companies. In fact, close to half of the revenues of S&P 500 companies are due to foreign sales.

ADOLPH: On Friday, City Council members rejected a proposal to double the head tax to raise more money for housing. They also rejected the mayor's proposal to cut the tax in half. Other cities have also struggled with taxing employers. Chicago ditched its head tax several years ago with Mayor Rahm Emanuel calling it a job killer. Philadelphia has a tax on wages that is the foundation of the city's budget. Some who've studied it believe it has driven jobs away. But now Philadelphia is shortlisted for Amazon's second headquarters. And with Amazon's future growth headed elsewhere, the big fear in Seattle is that a head tax could kill jobs. At Friday's City Council meeting, resident Trevor Robinson (ph) said it could all be true.
Challenges on states' rights grounds are not likely to succeed. But because of the novelty of the requirement that individuals buy insurance, other constitutional challenges are certain.

There's a lot of competition out there, Sharpe said. Cutting our quarterly excise tax in half would give us this awesome amount of money lying around, so we could boost our quality control lab, buy more new, exciting hops, and hire more employees.
The Bundys were early and savvy users of social media in rural America. It has helped them shift the story away from the court orders — and laws — Cliven Bundy is alleged to have violated and toward one of a defiant cowboy taking a stand against a tyrannical federal government.
SHAPIRO: We are going to hear about that elsewhere in the program. I want to end by asking you both about abortion laws that are moving through Republican-controlled state legislatures. In Georgia this week, Governor Brian Kemp signed a law that effectively outlaws abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy. Republican governors in Mississippi, Kentucky and Ohio have signed similar laws this year. And this week, the Alabama State Senate nearly voted on a more restrictive version of a heartbeat law, but things descended into chaos when an exemption for rape and incest was removed from the bill.
On some occasions, it may be appropriate for a journalist to deliver an essay reflecting on the news or events in our lives. Show hosts do this most regularly. These essays should be designed to cultivate a more personal bond with our audience and to add meaningful dimension to our coverage, not to inject our opinions. They should not call into question our fair and impartial reporting of the news. All our journalists – hosts, reporters and others – must work with editors and supervisors to ensure this standard is upheld in every essay we deliver.
And the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is, you know, an enormous lobbying powerhouse in Congress. And after a change in leadership a couple decades ago, it really changed its approach to focus on the biggest businesses in the country - indeed in the world - such that the majority of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's millions and millions in revenue comes from just 64 donors. And so I think you have a situation in which there's a lot of distortion as a result of these global corporations and what they want our wages to be or where they think the wages should be in this country versus what most people in most businesses want.
So when the opportunity came along to get on as a welder at a newer manufacturing company in town, Jeff's dad urged him to take it.

SHAPIRO: Bethany, if it's possible to make this distinction, how much of this debate in the states do you think is about a heartfelt policy desire, and how much is about political, electoral politics trying to turn out voters, et cetera?
But, Ari, like, look at the big picture here, right? Like, this is a nearly $2 trillion bill filled with Democratic spending priorities. It's one of the most expensive spending bills in American history. It's the top priority for the Biden administration. So on the whole, I think Democrats see this bill as a major victory, especially early in this new Democratic-controlled Washington. And many policies in this bill, like those stimulus checks and like money to get those schools reopened, are very, very popular with the public right now.
Last night, Donald Trump released details of his health plan. No surprise - he wants to repeal Obamacare. NPR's Alison Kodjak reports that the other proposals on Trump's website include many Republican favorites and some that both liberals and conservatives find troubling.
A handful of House Democrats, including Georgia Rep. John Lewis, plan to skip the speech entirely, according to The Hill.
But then his meaning got muddier. Anchor Becky Quick asked him twice if he really meant he wanted to renegotiate debt. On his second answer, he seemed to change positions:
The rules and incentives of our economy reward corporations for putting short-term stock prices above long-term investments in workers, equipment, and research.
The president will not slow down work on this urgent crisis response, and will not settle for a package that fails to meet the moment, the statement read.
So this is a combination of Bill Barr, the attorney general's, long-standing belief in a very strong executive. He really doesn't think Congress should be investigating the president. And that fits nicely with Trump's, really, lifelong instinct, which is if you're not fighting, you're losing. He also doesn't want the exposure and the optics of having Mueller testify before the cameras. And, of course, he has a career-long history of litigiousness - take his enemies to court, cost them some money and, above all, run out the clock.
MARTIN: Well, let's go back to when you and other officers from the Congressional Black Caucus actually met with President Trump. That was in March of last year. Do you remember that meeting? Do you remember what your impressions were of him then?
The papers also reported over the past few weeks that Donald Trump himself has not contributed to the foundation since 2008 but that he's been using the charity's money to settle business-related lawsuits.
Too many Americans feel that way right now. It's one of the few regrets of my presidency – that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better. There's no doubt a president with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee I'll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office.
62 percent of millennials have considered starting their own business.
BALABAN: It's thinner than the consistency you're probably used to, but dries quickly and smells nice, too. Anyone who buys a bottle of rum at Cotton & Reed gets a free bottle of hand sanitizer. But most of it, they're donating.
The proposal would provide a new round of financial support for workers, families and businesses, including direct payments of up to $1,400 for eligible individuals and couples; an expansion and extension of supplemental unemployment benefits; and an increase to the child tax credit.
There were, however, obvious fissures about how to proceed, and they proved impossible to overcome. Less than 14 hours after McConnell announced the path forward, it was again blocked when three Republicans announced their opposition.
JOHNSON: This bookkeeper worked for Paul Manafort for many years. She testified he was very knowledgeable, very detail-oriented and that he approved every penny of everything we paid. The bookkeeper said early on financial statements for Manafort and his company were flush. They helped buy all those things we've talked about, the suits and the real estate and the landscaping with hundreds of flowers that spelled out the letter M.
In a written statement, Kevin Manning — a spokesperson for the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau — compared the plaintiffs' claims to conspiracy theories that are outlandish and should be disregarded.
That step cut the company's losses, but it also opened up an intriguing new possibility. We realized there was an opportunity right away, says Beth Soholt, executive director of the Clean Grid Alliance, based in Minnesota.
OSNOS: Yeah, that's right. The hyperbole in saying that they would undermine the Obama presidency is that once an executive order has gone beyond what's known as the rulemaking stage, then that means that in order to undo it there has to be, for instance, a period of public comment. There has to be other bureaucratic steps. And that can take as much as a year or more depending on how efficiently the bureaucracy goes about it. And that's meaningful because I think the question of how civil servants will interpret efforts to try to undermine previous initiatives matters. But the relevant point is that by issuing the executive order the clock on that process begins.
And Adam Orman, who co-owns Austin-based L'Oca d'Oro and subsidizes his employees' health care with a direct primary care contract and other additional benefits, worries there would still be so many layers of bureaucracy.
Now, Andrew Breitbart, who's a commentator for the Washington Times and got a lot of attention for his investigative work criticizing the grassroots organization ACORN is now saying he'll pay, you know, thousands of dollars for proof that this incident actually happened. And I'd like to ask each of you, what is your take on this?
Former Rep. Bob Ney, who also served time after being convicted as part of the same scandal, said, House Republicans should not have done this and also the way they did it without announcing it is not a public policy to be proud of.
Lots of states, from Colorado to South Carolina, Michigan to Mississippi, could end up feeling the pinch. One of the few states that won't, though, is Texas, where the idea began with Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.
POGGIOLI: Well, you know, it's still early. But if we look at how Italians in the north reacted to the first round, I'd say they got the message. They've taken it very seriously. I think Italians are even surprised themselves at how obedient they've been. There was one big exception, and that was there were a lot of prison riots, people protesting - inmates protesting suspension of family visits. Six inmates died. Several escaped from one prison.
COLEMAN: So this isn't the first time Pruitt's drawn this kind of criticism. Isn't that so?
Speaking to CEOs on Tuesday, President Trump touted his plans for deregulation and infrastructure-building. In the process, he made a striking claim: that the Obama administration passed an infrastructure bill that built nothing and gave money to social programs.
Later, during a rare gaggle with reporters, Biden emphasized the point.
ELVING: ...Some of the former officials who had been involved in the Iran-Contra affair more than five years earlier under previous president Ronald Reagan. And President Clinton pardoned a financier named Marc Rich, who was a fugitive from tax charges.
DETROW: NPR addiction correspondent Brian Mann has been reporting on this story. Good morning, Brian.
It's unclear whether or how Republicans and Democrats will be able to find common ground on a funding source for a large infrastructure package, something that has eluded them for years.
Lee won the GOP nomination over Representative Diane Black, who was backed by Vice President Mike Pence, and poured millions of dollars from her own personal fortune into the campaign, according to The Washington Post.
This is also, obviously, complicated by the fact that the president has also faced similar allegations. It was famously caught during the campaign in those Access Hollywood tapes where he bragged about groping and kissing women. Letting voters decide seems to be the standard he thinks applies to himself and Roy Moore but not to Democrats like Al Franken.
Gas-powered pickups and SUVs now make up two-thirds of U.S. auto sales. But, until recently, truck buyers looking for an American-made electric-powered pickup would be out of luck. America's small electric vehicle fleet is just that — small, mostly cars and sedans. That's where a new startup automaker saw an opening.
This week, as part of our A Nation Engaged project, NPR and some member stations will be talking about trade — both on the campaign trail and in communities around the country.
The combination of financial market volatility, the government shutdown and trade tensions created a trifecta of anxiety and uncertainty impacting spending, said National Retail Federation chief economist Jack Kleinhenz.
GRAVES: Thank you so much for having me on.
Now, whether we will be able to renew that bargain on even better terms for the 21st century depends, in large measure, on the outcome of this election.
MONTAGNE: We have a short clip of that. Why don't we take a listen to Donald Trump?
Robert Santos, vice president and chief methodologist at the Urban Institute, sees the project as California officials doing their due diligence when it comes to mitigating the risk of an undercount. But Santos warns the state's efforts may ultimately do more harm than good.
Florida passed an amendment in 2018, promising to restore voting rights for over a million Floridians with felony convictions. But that hope turned to confusion soon after.
Another Texan, Republican Sen. John Cornyn, is inviting Manny Padilla, the Border Patrol's Rio Grande Valley sector chief, an aide in Cornyn's office confirmed to NPR.
It's expensive to live here on a rental basis, said Herrick. But if things took a turn for the worse, where you are advised not to travel at all? I don't think we'd have an option then; we're going to have to stay here.
And, yeah, some people actually follow through with it. The Guardian dug up one such couple earlier this year. Another immigration lawyer tells NPR that he has definitely seen this happen on a wider scale.
In the current state, take the Midwest, for example ... it's pretty much corn, beans, hogs and some cattle. So you've got basically three or four opportunities to benefit. We got the renewable fuel industry, which created a new potential opportunity for farmers to benefit from processing of their crops.
Multiple staffers said they were told that if they kept their Bloomberg-issued iPhones and MacBooks, they would be taxed on their 2020 returns.
We must stop the steal and then we must ensure that such outrageous election fraud never happens again, can never be allowed to happen again.
Mulvaney was asked whether this budget would include funding for the president's vaunted border wall, which Trump has promised that Mexico would pay for; Mexico, however, has continued to insist it will not. Mulvaney said that he did expect some funding for that wall to be included in a future supplemental, while a 2018 budget would contain more.
The letter continues. There is clear evidence that tens of thousands of votes were switched from President Trump to former Vice President Biden in several counties in Georgia.
None of this may come to pass. Trump notoriously hates losing. He made his name in the pages of the tabloid press and as the subject of gauzy interviews on entertainment TV shows. He loves being allowed to weigh in on serious matters in interviews with television news anchors. As the winner of the biggest prize of all he may invite the press in to chronicle his triumph. If he does, it is because the siren call of the klieg lights has won out over his anger. But it is hard for the media to rely on his insincerity for salvation.
INSKEEP: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat representing the Bronx and Queens, was in her office across the street from the Capitol here in Washington.
LEVINE: Well, so far - and it's interesting that you bring up Robert Mercer - he and his daughter Rebecca have been, you know, very active on the political landscape. And they are very independent. They had worked with the Koch network for some time but formed their own superPAC in 2016 and are known for being willing to back candidates that don't always win, frankly. He's given money so far this election cycle to a primary candidate in the Arizona Senate race, Kelli Ward, who had previously run against John McCain, didn't win. But he's backing her again. So that kind of thing shows he's really willing to go a little bit against the establishment party, which is looking for primary candidates who they see as very viable in the general election.
KELLY: OK, so the 216 that would be needed to get it out of the House. Well, from what you have seen, has it changed enough from the March version to win your vote?
And you ask yourself, well, wait a minute, why did the richest Americans and the biggest corporations get away with manipulating the tax code so they pay lower rates than you do? That's a good question.
Now it's just out in the open, because everywhere you drive in the county you see the fencing, and everybody just assumes it must be just another legal grow going on.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Dave, what have the Republicans, do you think, learned from this election? What is the lesson?
Voice of America CEO Accused Of Fraud, Misuse Of Office All In One Week
Republicans, at this point, just need to keep Ossoff below 50 percent and force him into a June 20 runoff, where they feel much better about the chances that one of several candidates who have emerged as top-tier challengers — most likely former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel, Johns Creek City Councilman Bob Gray, state Sen. Judson Hill or former state Sen. Dan Moody — would have against Ossoff then.
Based on simulations run by the Treasury Department, the GAO says taxes for 30 million Americans — 21 percent of taxpayers — are being underwithheld by their employers, meaning they are getting a larger check this year, but will owe at tax time in April. According to the simulations, 73 percent of taxpayers will be overwithheld and receive a refund from the Internal Revenue Service.
They were also demanding that the president release his tax returns.
We have a wrap of a chaotic week for politics and look at what's coming up in the week ahead.
What that will actually translate into is it becoming much easier for wealthy people to have children than for other people to have children, Kukla says.
We've been spinning our wheels on too many important issues because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle, McCain said in a speech on the Senate floor. That's an approach that's been employed by both sides, mandating legislation from the top down, without any support from the other side, with all the parliamentary maneuvers that requires. We're getting nothing done.
INSLEE: Yes, it is unifying because everyone - Republicans and Democrats - have an interest in not letting America catch fire. So everyone is going to benefit from this.
MARTIN: One correction now - earlier we described the Kamala Harris campaign as backtracking from one aspect of Medicare-for-all. Her campaign has said that in fact she remains supportive of the Medicare-for-all bill she co-sponsors with Bernie Sanders.
Both House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have signed on to the deal, albeit reluctantly. But there was no keeping a lid on the dissent within their party.
Around $5 million is going to the RAND Corporation for the Santa Monica, Calif.-based think tank's survey research group to conduct a small-scale count involving around 20,000 homes, a fraction of a percentage of California's 13 million households. The state selected households mostly from areas where there's been low census participation.
Now, those challenges emerged long before the great recession, and they have persisted through our recovery. There's too much inequality, too little upward mobility. It is just too hard to get ahead today.
I stepped in, told the two that they maybe should take a break from Twitter for a bit, do something else (or at least remove me from their mentions). Both responded. They apologized to each other and to me, and they both promised to log off for a bit. One mentioned trying to play a role in creating a nicer world after the election.
MARTIN: So we know Kamala Harris is behind this idea. What about the other candidates who've thrown their hat into the ring thus far?
Mike Herrick and his wife, Jane, have been heading from their home on Lake Superior in Herbster, Wis., to Tucson, Ariz., for the past 11 winters. They were hoping to return home at the end of April. Then Herrick discovered that local officials had asked some homeowners not to return.
The CDC says if you're fully vaccinated against COVID-19, you can gather together in small groups with other vaccinated people or people who are at low risk of severe disease. And you can do it without masks or physical distancing - news every grandparent in America took immediate note of. For the first time since COVID-19 upended life in this country, some leading public health voices now say the worst of the pandemic may be behind us.
So given that, let's take Trump's two claims one by one. First, there's nobody ever saw anything being built. To this day I haven't heard of anything that's been built.
So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do. And I hope he doesn't listen to the RINOs and the stupid people that he's listening to.

We haven't had a national unemployment rate this low for this long in 50 years. Here in South Carolina, the unemployment rate is even lower, said CBS moderator Norah O'Donnell. How will you convince voters that a Democratic socialist can do better than President Trump with the economy?
While newly approved vaccines offer hope for relief from the pandemic, Biden described the sluggish initial delivery of the shots as a dismal failure.
He will do and say whatever is in his interest, even if it means swindling working families to make millions for himself, said Deputy Communications Director Christina Reynolds. Now Trump is promising the same reckless, self-centered approach to running the country's economy — with large tax breaks for the wealthy, and a plan that independent experts say would cost millions of jobs.
GREENE: Well, let me ask you about politics. Let's say you have a Pennsylvania voter in your district who backed President Trump - maybe likes the big tax cut, maybe doesn't like the Affordable Care Act - Obamacare - feels that the president has shown leadership on the world stage. How do you win that person over?
If you look at what other developers have done over that same time period, what Trump did was unusual in scale but not unusual in type, she adds.
GROSS: ...And like, little handouts that are anonymously placed on cars in parking lots. And it's hard to trace back to an individual.
The Trump administration is reviewing the programs, and the White House is preparing a January executive order related to welfare, according to Politico. NPR's Mara Liasson reports that the president wants to keep his promise not to touch the big, middle-class entitlements — Medicare and Social Security — but he is interested in reforming means-tested programs that target lower-income Americans.
People who are in this country, are working, and productive Americans who are contributing, I personally would not like to see those people deported, says Moore, who is also an economic consultant with FreedomWorks, the grass-roots organization that helped launch the Tea Party.
She says it seems clear that long-haulers qualify for protections under the Americans with Disability Act, which would afford them accommodations for things like housing and accessing government services. But the question of whether long-haulers will be eligible for federal disability benefits is still being debated.
JEFF WILLIAMS: Many cities rely on property tax revenue. We haven't even experienced that yet because the appraisals are going on right now. And many of our commercial businesses - the values have really gone down. So we are bracing for another 10% hit. And then we don't know.

So we thought we'd get this group together to get their take on what this means going forward. Joining us, Puneet Ahluwalia. He is a businessman and a Republican Party activist from Northern Virginia. Welcome back.
But the election of Donald Trump as president and Republican majorities in both houses of Congress mean that proposition, like the rest of the health law, is now in doubt.
First of all, there's no rush, Kind said. I gotta believe that the Mueller team already has their hands on the president's tax returns. If they're looking for a possible connection between Russia and his family, there is a danger in trying to go too far too fast.
Yesterday, they attended a forum by the Black Economic Alliance, a political group championing economic opportunities for black Americans. And a new poll out today by South Carolina's The Post and Courier shows interesting new data. Here to talk about all that is Gavin Jackson. He's in Charleston right now, and he's a reporter for SCETV and the host of This Week In South Carolina.
Think of that one. You got the ballot back. Let's send the ballots. Oh, they've already been sent. But we got the ballot back before they were sent. I don't think that's too good, right?
MARTIN: Well, what are those forces?
GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. Flipping Flynn. Let's start with that. Is this on par with indicting former Trump campaign chairman Manafort, or is this a huge new trophy and a huge new face for the Mueller investigation? Let's start with you, Heather.
But the idea of checking IDs for energy drink purchases has been rumbling around for a while. Morrisons tested this initiative in 2014, then ended the pilot at the end of that year.
The danger of being unable to speak freely about bodies, Gunter says, is twofold. If women can't discuss health concerns with their doctor, not only will they miss out on treatment, but they also may get bad advice from less reputable, clandestine sources.
PRIME MINISTER GIUSEPPE CONTE: (Speaking Italian).
Manafort's camp has long denied that he has any information to offer Mueller's team, including about possible coordination between Trump associates and Russia during the presidential race.
Spain is riveted by something that country has never seen before - a royal on trial. Testimony began today in the trial of Spain's Princess Cristina, the king's sister, who is charged with tax fraud. It's being held on the Spanish island of Majorca. And we reached reporter Lauren Frayer at the courthouse. And Lauren, paint us a picture of this - really it's an historic trial, right?
Pineau-Chaisson's wife has become her primary caregiver. She said her wife has always been supportive and encouraging, even when she needed help getting in and out of the shower.
The Russia issue threatens to hobble Trump's presidency, as it is likely to be an ongoing nuisance for the Trump White House. Controversy related to it has already cost Trump his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn. And his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, recused himself from any investigations into the Trump presidential campaign following revelations that Sessions wasn't completely forthcoming during his confirmation hearing about his own contact with the Russian ambassador.
Furman also supports massive investments in fighting the virus, unemployment insurance and other parts of a comprehensive approach to help Americans during the crisis. But he believes sending checks is an efficient and quick way to help people pay their bills and stimulate the economy. True, he says, it won't revive supply chains or restaurants and bars, but even if it's simply relief for struggling families, he says, that would be enough for me.
Trump would roll back tough rules on the financial industry. I'll do the opposite – we should strengthen those rules so that Wall Street can never wreck Main Street again!
The U.S. economy is about to get a shot of its own.
With the GOP field fractured, Ossoff has been able to corral his considerable resources into a sizable advantage, and his best shot is to deliver a knockout punch and win the April 18 contest outright. If he's pushed into a runoff, and the race becomes a more traditional contest and GOP attacks have more time to permeate, winning Tom Price's old House seat looks much harder for Ossoff.
INSKEEP: Well, Senator Brown, we'll pay attention to your travels. Thanks for joining us this morning.
Payments to full- and part-time workers taking family leave who've been employed for at least a year would be eligible for the employer's tax break. But the program, which is designed to test whether this approach works well, is set to last just two years — ending after 2019.
But then again, Trump knew at some point that this bill was about economic stimulus, rather than just road- and bridge-building, because back in 2009 he applauded the stimulus for taking a multiple-pronged approach to boosting the economy.
I want to see our country united, Trump told network anchors at a luncheon Tuesday previewing the speech. I want to bring our country back from a tremendous divisiveness, which he said dates back many years.
The other reason is, you know, I'm a - you know, having spent so much time over the years talking to people who have struggled with medical bills, who've gone through real hardship. And it hits you every time that it's not that these people have made all the right decisions necessarily, it's not that they've always put themselves in the best positions, but the end of the day, they're - people, you know, are unlucky and they suffer because of it. And, you know, I - you know, I'm not afraid to sort of say that. I think just as a moral principle, if you're facing an injury or a serious illness, you shouldn't also have to worry about paying your bills. It's bad enough to have to worry about the illness or the injury. That's hard. Anyone who's ever been through that, anyone who's been - had a family member go through that, it can be incredibly traumatic. It's difficult. It's hard.
Beginning in 2019, the measure eliminates the tax penalty for people who don't have health insurance — one of the most unpopular features of the Affordable Care Act. Without that tax penalty, congressional forecasters estimate that 13 million more Americans will go without insurance, and premiums on the individual Obamacare market will increase by an average of 10 percent.
SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Korva.
State Rep. Sara Innamorato (D-Allegheny) said she wants her colleagues to see the negative health and environmental costs of petrochemical or fertilizer manufacturing plants. She organized a panel discussion last week on that topic.
The proposal comes after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blamed Democrats for delaying progress on a response bill. Senate Democrats have said the final product of the GOP-backed bill didn't meet their minimum demands.
The governor ordered the closure of bars and restaurants, while still allowing carry-out and drive-through service to continue. He also mandated the closure of the state's casinos.
When people see their withholding improving, when they see the jobs occurring, when they see bigger paychecks, a fairer tax system, a simpler tax code, that's what's going to produce the results, Ryan said in 2017. Results are going to make this popular.
After all, Americans are running away from the middle. The Pew Research Center has found that Americans are more ideologically polarized. Perhaps more startlingly, Pew also found that people not only dislike the other party more and more, but they also in large numbers see the opposite party as a threat. When a candidate looks even remotely like someone who might compromise, that could easily scare off lots of voters (though this is more true on the Republican side). Not only that, but people distrust the government at near-record levels, according to Pew data.
By February, the bill's sponsors had shifted to a compromise that would require companies to offer paid family and medical time off, but would leave it up to employers to determine how to provide that.
Normally, if people have COBRA coverage and they drop it midyear, they can't sign up for a marketplace plan until the annual fall open enrollment period. But this special enrollment period will give people that option.
[Just three days ago, the Chicago Tribune reported that nearly 2,200 people have been shot in Chicago this year, with 329 of those people dead. The Tribune also reported that that's 100 more such deaths than at this point last year. — Danielle Kurtzleben]
An email sent to senators and staff asked them to remain in their offices and await a visit from a health professional, KOSU reports.
As ridership plummets, so too does fare revenue. And Schlickman says with bars, restaurants and shops closing down, there's a huge drop off in sales tax revenue, too. Sales tax is probably the largest source of tax revenue that transit systems rely on across the country, he says.
LIASSON: I think it poses a problem to the Democratic debate planners because it's really hard to cram that many people on one stage, even in two bunches. But I think very quickly, the field will be winnowed. Already, you can see a kind of normal-sized Democratic field. Top five candidates - that's Biden, Sanders, Warren, Harris, Buttigieg. So I do think that, eventually, this field will start looking a lot more normal than it does right now.
What did Trump initially say about debt?
Trump is simultaneously waging a trade war with Canada, Mexico and the European Union. He has ordered tariffs on imported steel and aluminum and repeatedly threatened to withdraw from NAFTA.
We are really pushing to get the [medical] system to help us by placing accommodations, Chemali says. [Long-haulers] might need to have less hours, better shifts, have more assistance at work.
ZARROLI: That was him speaking in an excruciating interview with Swedish Television this weekend. Gunnlaugsson was apparently unaware of the document leak, and wasn't ready for the question that followed.
Elizabeth is leading the fight to liberate millions of Americans from the burden of student debt.
And so actually that means that for the first two years of the Trump administration, our forecast has been either exactly at or below the economic growth experienced in the year, which is the first time that that's ever happened.
House Speaker Paul Ryan had said prior to the failure today that he believed doing nothing was more politically dangerous than trying to advance a repeal or replacement bill. So yes, there are absolutely political consequences to this. We just don't know what they're going to be yet. But we do know that Republicans, every Republican who ran for the House and Senate and White House last year, ran on a promise to do this.
President Trump has made clear he doesn't like the alternative minimum tax, a complex federal levy that will hit some 4.8 million taxpayers this year.

Evans ran the Economic Research Service during parts of the George W. Bush and Obama administrations. She says that more than half of agency employees decided to quit rather than uproot their families and move. Despite aggressive recruiting in Kansas City and making many new hires, both USDA research agencies are now roughly half the size they were before the move.
Yes, All This Happened. Trump's First 2 Weeks As President
CHUCK SCHUMER: If you want the truth, you have to have witnesses, you have to have documents. Who has ever heard of a trial without witnesses and documents?
Donald Trump's election early Wednesday as president — utterly unprecedented, utterly unexpected — caught the media flat-footed. The distance between the nation's political press corps and its people has never seemed so stark. The pundits swung and missed. The polls failed. The predictive surveys of polls, the Upshots and FiveThirtyEights, et al. with their percentage certainties, jerked violently in the precise opposite direction of their predictions as election night progressed.
Wolf plans to veto the bill.
Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan used it to defend his fellow Republican, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, as she was stripped of her House committee assignments following her support of conspiracy theories including QAnon, as well as racist social media posts.​
Also, public campaign spending by corporations is much more restricted than spending by super PACs and especially tax-exempt advocacy groups that don't disclose their donors. Plus, a lot of corporate money in American politics flows from individuals, corporate executives and other employees.
WALKER: So if you're making whiskey or gin or vodka or rum - anything, as long as you have spirit on hand that is above 60% alcohol.
It also remains unclear just what this move means for Medvedev, a longtime Putin loyalist who played a key role in the president's last grapple with constitutional term limits. According to Tass, Putin announced plans to appoint Medvedev to the newly created office of deputy head of the Russian Security Council.
SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Mitt Romney didn't speak for long this morning at the University of Utah, but he made his feelings about Donald Trump quite clear.

But other Republicans think the party can heal itself.
A common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make.
The GAO acknowledges that the IRS has cautioned taxpayers that they may need to review and update their withholding as a result of the new law.
If you need to deal with taxes or visas, everything is here, Vanier says.
GROSS: Oh, OK. Great. I'll just wait until it goes (laughter).
Michael Ceci, Farrell's city manager, says tariffs are an abomination for his community.
KELLY: Like, when will there be a treatment?
Unlike other recent presidents, Trump has steadfastly refused to release his tax returns, saying he was under federal audit, which has led to enormous speculation about how much he really earns and where he gets his money.
HORSLEY: Well, we don't know exactly what that aid is going to look like, but you heard the president there talking about emergency action to help workers who don't have sick leave. The idea is to make up for that lost pay if they're forced to stay home. And the president says he'll act on an emergency basis on his own, and then he's asking Congress for help to extend that relief.
On Friday, a group of anonymous USAGM and VOA whistleblowers represented by the private Government Accountability Project filed a formal complaint to Pack, Reilly, Congress. the U.S. State Department inspector general and the U.S. Special Counsel, another investigative office.
I was like, 'Yeah, yeah: I'll believe it when I see it.' And I said that months ago, Garrison says.
I'm Tamara Keith. I cover the White House.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: When you say that you mean single-payer.
And so when he first heard about President Trump's tariffs, he applauded the president. He says he still does but doesn't understand why his company should be punished for importing steel.
I'm the master of my day to a large extent. In terms of why I do contract work, I think that's a key thing. 0:58
Troy Montigney of Indiana says he's hearing from a lot of curious parents.
DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Evan Osnos. He is a staff writer for The New Yorker magazine. He's written about what a Trump administration may look like.
Before the inauguration, the GSA expressed concern about Trump's Washington, D.C., hotel, which was built in a former post office building owned by the federal government. (It's coincidentally located across the street from the FBI building.) Elected officials are barred from holding the lease on the property.
KELLY: Richard Harris, just as we continue to tick through all of the developments and news nuggets that were coming out of this White House briefing today, I want to turn back to another question that's been on the front of people's mind, which is testing. Are there enough tests? Or can everybody who says they want to test, can they get a test? Where - did they make news on that today?
POGGIOLI: Yeah. We understand that the government is about to make the announcement that all schools, as you said, and universities will be shut down through March 15. Then we're also expecting them to announce that public gatherings will be banned nationwide. Now, for soccer, which is Italy's secular religion, that means that matches for the next month would be held in empty stadiums. Now, the delay in - we understand, perhaps, that the reason we're getting this delay in the announcement is because Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is trying to get full bipartisan - multipartisan, let's say - support for these measures to tackle the national emergency.
In a speech on Thursday, Mitt Romney sharply criticized Donald Trump. The former 2012 presidential candidate called Trump a fraud and a phony. Romney said he would vote for any of the other Republican contenders, but did not endorse one.
As premiums and health costs rise, the broader industry seems to be eyeing the option with a mix of new curiosity and old concerns.
Iraq is not unique in this respect. Many oil-exporting countries have been bruised by low oil prices, and many have centralized economies with lots of state employees.
INSKEEP: I'm kind of enjoying the idea that part of their acquaintance was a lawsuit because Trump may know lots of interesting people that way, given his history with lawsuits.
We have — are near — to an agreement, Pelosi said at the Capitol late Thursday.
MOORE: But who will that affect? That'll affect people with incomes over a half a million dollars and millionaires and billionaires who take a lot of deductions. They're not going to have a big, big massive tax cut 'cause they're going to lose their loopholes.
The White House says it remains focused on the denuclearization of North Korea. But the president also tweeted criticism of China, a key player in achieving that goal. And, ironically, it is China that is stepping forward as more of a world leader as the United States has receded, as some see it, under Trump.
The misinformation consumed by many on the right has been fed for decades through prime-time cable dressed up as straight news. Facebook memes and outfits even further on the fringe than Fox News are growing in popularity. Conspiracies are being mainstreamed.

What it specifically said was this article, in essence, this part of state law, does not create and shall not be construed to create or support a statutory or common-law private right of action. And no person may bring any civil action based upon the public policy in that law. And what that means is it takes away the rules for people who are fired or believe they've been fired because of their age, their race, their national origin, their religion or their gender.

That's especially true for upper-income workers, who pay the lion's share of state taxes and who have generally managed to keep working during the pandemic, said Goldwein. But there is a lot of variation around the country. States that are heavily dependent on tourism or oil drilling suffered a much bigger blow to their budgets.
We need to write — we need to write a new chapter in the American dream and it can't be Chapter 11.
Who would have believed that when we started this journey // because we are a team would have received almost 14 million votes the most in the history of the Republican party and that the Republican party would get 60 percent more votes than it received eight years ago. Who would have believed this. Who would have believed this.
Clean energy and climate advocates say the huge stimulus bill Congress is negotiating should address not only the economy, but also climate change. But a split over that appears to have contributed to delays in passing the bill.
Asked whether the coronavirus shock will send the American economy into recession, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sounded confident that the U.S. economy is resilient enough to push through the financial jitters.
If that 4% tax were imposed, it is indeed possible that some families could end up paying less. But that depends, for example, on the family and how much they spend on health care now.
Republicans first need to pass a budget resolution, the annual political exercise Corker derided as a waste of time at this week's hearing because of the hours of theatrics required to pass a resolution along a predictable party-line vote.
The man who won the Republican nomination four years ago is going after the candidate who is the party's current frontrunner. Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney gave a speech today urging Republicans to do everything in their power to stop Donald Trump. And then Trump hit back. Here's NPR's Sarah McCammon.
It also did not say which U.S. factories would be affected. The company's U.S. factories are in York, Pa., and Menomonee Falls, Wis. It plans to close another plant in Kansas City, Mo., next year.
Now, as President Donald Trump promises a replacement for the Affordable Care Act that will provide insurance for everybody, employers worry Republican attempts to redo other parts of the insurance market could harm their much larger one.
TIMMONS: Well, the Manafort - accusations against Manafort having to do with money laundering are one thing. But if you read Flynn's statement of offense, what it seems to show is that there was a coordinated effort among the Trump transition team to talk to Russia about sanctions and to talk to them and to contradict what a sitting President Obama's foreign policy was. And so it is really a completely separate matter and a lot more serious.
LIZZIE SHACKLEFORD: My biggest concern, though, is how you will win the primary at a time when Democrats are really looking for change from white men.
BLUE: And I sat outside for a while and waited. I thought, you know, I need to hear something. People walking by - anything. And it was so strange.
In the election for governor, a candidate will replace Republican Governor Bill Haslam who was blocked from running for a third term due to term limits. According to The Tennessean, candidates have spent a record $51 million in the gubernatorial race. Six candidates competed for the Republican nomination, and three candidates ran against each other on the Democratic side.

The idea of a cancel culture is inherently controversial. What one person might see as being canceled for controversial statements, another might see as being held accountable for offensive or harmful views.
I happen to live next door to the Rome prison, and I heard shouting from both inmates inside and relatives outside.

The outreach from more moderate GOP lawmakers came as many Democrats look to a process called budget reconciliation, which would potentially enable Democrats to approve the president's plan without any Republican support.
The timing and location are yet to be determined. But if the meeting between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ultimately happens, it will be a first. No sitting U.S. president has ever met face to face with a North Korean dictator.

Feb 6 2019 Draft of Pennsylvania Nuclear Bill (PDF)
MONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, it's not the first time that President Trump has criticized John McCain in this way. I mean, remember; four years ago, he talked about Senator McCain wasn't a war hero because he was captured. And he likes - prefers people who weren't captured. So this has been an ongoing thing for a long time. And a lot of Republicans felt that him doing that initially would derail his campaign. And it certainly did not. So, you know, looking at whether or not this could derail him in any other way, I think, is probably a fool's errand. But when you think about what Mark Salter said in a more broad way about Republicans and being willing to stomach some of this for what he said were a few drop - a few points drop in the corporate tax rate, he said he feels that's not worth it.
BEYER: Susan - great question. And, really, what I've called for is that Jamie Raskin, who's our only - who's our constitutional scholar in the House.
Of course, a company-by-company negotiation does not a jobs policy make. This is a tiny symbolic gesture — 1,000 jobs is less than 0.01 percent of the manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Moreover, the country still has about 1.5 million fewer manufacturing jobs than it did prior to the recession. Trump faces a reality that journalists have pointed out over and over, both during this campaign and during the earlier years of the Obama presidency: manufacturing jobs aren't coming back, at least not to anywhere near their prior highs.
HORSLEY: It's probably a little bit closer to the Senate version. That's where the Republican margin was narrower, so they kind of stuck with that. On the state and local tax question, for example, it was the Senate version that prevailed. So people in high-tax states will be able to deduct up to $10,000 in local tax, including both property taxes and either income taxes or sales tax. So the final bill is not quite so punitive for people in those high-tax states.

Over the past several weeks, we've amassed overwhelming evidence about a fake election. This is the presidential election. Last night was a little bit better because of the fact that we had a lot of eyes watching one specific state, but they cheated like hell anyway.
For the most part, NPR journalists with a role in covering the news should stick to reporting and analysis. We should not tread beyond well-supported conclusions based on our reporting and should not present opinions as fact. Our aim is to give the public the evidence to weigh and develop their own opinions, without the intrusion of ours.
DONOVAN: We return to Congress on Tuesday and that expires on Friday, so I suspect that's going to be the first thing on the plate to continue our government running after Friday. But the president has an ambitious agenda. He wants to do health care. He wants to do tax reform. He wants to get the infrastructure, which I'm sure is a priority of his. And so we're going to go back to work. And I'm sure Congress could do more than one thing at a time, but I just want to get it right rather than getting it passed.

On a peaceful day at the beach, people stroll along a path and water laps gently against the shore, but you won't find anyone swimming. That's because the sand is fenced off, and there are warning signs and security cameras to keep people out.
KELLY: Well - so then, how should we read the market's reaction today, which was not great?
The retiring lawmaker told Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep he is planning a series of speeches about the critical importance of facts and truth to American democracy. Flake continues to be one of the few GOP legislators to vigorously speak out against Trump.

Payments start tapering off for individuals making $75,000 per year, or married couples making $150,000. And unlike the earlier stimulus checks, the maximum cutoff is lower: Individuals no longer qualify once they make $80,000 a year ($160,000 for couples).
The limitations that budget reconciliation put on the COVID-19 relief bill reignited the push from those on the left to eliminate the legislative filibuster. Getting 10 Republicans to consider backing a relief bill proved too high a hurdle, so the notion that Democrats could attract support from enough to reach the 60-vote threshold on things like a multitrillion-dollar infrastructure package, climate change legislation, gun control bills or other major priorities would likely be much tougher, if not impossible.
This exchange encapsulated one of the biggest arguments in tonight's debate over health care: whether candidates would raise taxes, and whether families' total health care bills would go up.

CORNISH: NPR's Don Gonyea is on the line from St. Petersburg. And, Don, we know Hillary Clinton is said to give her own big policy speech on Thursday, but she didn't exactly wait to push back on Trump, right? What else did she have to say?
Trump enlists conservative economists, including Stephen Moore of the Heritage Foundation, to make his tax plan more politically palatable. Mary Louise Kelly talks to Moore about advising Trump.
Mr. JOHN McKINNEY (Attorney): The senator has said that what this is is a polluter pays tax. In fact, that's wrong.
It's also true that China and other countries have gamed the system for too long. Enforcement — especially during the Bush administration — has been too lax. Investments at home that would make us more competitive have been blocked. And American workers and communities have paid the price.
In October, a survey from the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators found that about 60% of financial aid offices at more than 200 colleges saw an increase in appeal requests between March 1 and Sept. 21 compared to the previous year. A third of respondents saw students' requests more than double.
LOWREY: So overall in the entire economy, the issue is not that health care costs are growing dramatically. The issue is that the burden placed on families is. So just between 2010 and 2016, the cost burden of family private insurance premiums jumped 28%, whereas incomes rose less than 20%. And on top of that, deductibles, which is what you have to pay before your insurance is kicking in - they soared. They've become much more common. And they've gotten much bigger. And that means that families are needing to spend a lot of their own money on top of paying for premiums or receiving public health coverage.
RAZ: And so late on the 29th of October, 1969, Charlie Kline, sitting at the UCLA computer lab, placed a phone call to Bill Duvall at Stanford.
In an interview with The Economist this week, Trump dismissed calls for his tax returns. Asked whether he would release them, he replied: I doubt it. I doubt it. Because they're not going to ... nobody cares about my tax return except for the reporters. Oh, at some point I'll release them. Maybe I'll release them after I'm finished because I'm very proud of them actually.
HORSLEY: He does. And he - it was conspicuously absent (laughter), the - with no mention of House Democrats, who do have the majority and would have to sign off on something like a payroll tax cut. Now, there are certain things that the administration might be able to do on its own using existing authorities - maybe some of those small business loans, for example. But it is going to take congressional action, and that means some buy-in from Democrats in the House.
When it comes to President Biden and his COVID-19 relief package, it's go big or go home.
Reporters for the website say there were no signs of a struggle in his apartment. But he had been previously threatened for his stories, and Paulina Rumyantseva, his editor, told CNN, As Maxim had big plans for his personal life and career, there is nothing to support a verdict of suicide.
SAGAL: And not only has it been 18 for years because of Archie Manning, in 2012, it was slowed down to honor his son, who wore number 10. And drivers were not happy. Bill, how did Sen. Booker do on our quiz?
He talks about holding on to two important elements of Obamacare. One is the ability to insure that people with pre-existing conditions can still get insurance, cannot be discriminated against by insurance companies. And then the other is to allow people up to the age of 26 to continue receiving insurance from their parents' providers. It's not clear how Donald Trump would be able to preserve those two elements while undoing the rest of the law.
In fact, it's that spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible. It's how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations. It's how we reformed our health care system, and reinvented our energy sector; how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops and veterans, and how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love.
USDA Research Agencies 'Decimated' By Forced Move. Undoing The Damage Won't Be Easy
[Trump's stated views on minimum wage have shifted during the campaign. In November, he said he believed U.S. wages were too high. Then in May, on Meet the Press, he said he thought $7.25 per hour was too low of a wage to live on. When host Chuck Todd pressed him on whether there should be a federally set minimum wage, Trump said, No, I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do. — Danielle Kurtzleben]
Scott Simon talks to NPR's Ron Elving about the week in politics, including President Trump's spat with the family of a deceased U.S. soldier and the Senate passing of a budget blueprint.
I think there's a growing bipartisan consensus that we have to do more to build the financial security of young families in this country, said Dunkley. They have to feel confident they can grow their families here, and if they don't, our economy is going to be in trouble.
They are also warily eyeing pension negotiations underway between state lawmakers, which may significantly alter the structure of state employee pensions. A similar alteration in Kentucky, which passed the state's Legislature in a surprise move last month, has prompted widespread protests in that state, as well.
The estimate for Miami-Dade County is that there are about 150,000 people — that's not just cases, that's people — that will qualify under this process, he said.
SIMON: The Trump administration has criticized the Affordable Care Act. Have they offered an alternative?
In a recent article in the journal First Things, titled Preparing for Winter, Trueman argued that conservative Christian schools need to begin planning for a worst-case scenario, where not only federal money but also tax-exempt status is revoked.
A scandal over the California National Guard's use of bonus money was first unearthed in 2010, when the Sacramento Bee reported that its incentive program had misspent as much as $100 million. The program's onetime leader, former Master Sgt. Toni Jaffe, was later sentenced to 30 months in prison, after pleading guilty to making $15 million in false claims.
When Trump decided to run for president, he probably said to himself, 'I'm an egomaniac. I don't believe in science. I think women are inferior. Where would I feel at home?' 
GARCIA-NAVARRO: I mean, it was fascinating to see this editorial in the Financial Times in the U.K. - that's a pretty conservative publication. And it called for radical reforms, governments being more active in the economy, seeing public services as investments and not liabilities, redistribution of wealth, basic income - as you mentioned - wealth tax. It took a pandemic. But what does that tell you?
KELLY: How fast is the disease spreading in the United States?
The bill includes $7.25 billion in new money for the small-business loan program known as PPP and will allow more nonprofits to apply, including groups that engage in advocacy and some limited lobbying. It also allows larger nonprofits to be eligible.
RON SCHAFER: I'm pleased with all the things that he's accomplished in rolling back regulations.
GROSS: Lately, you've been covering the pandemic. What are some of the changes the Biden administration has been making or plans to make regarding the pandemic?
The problems we face now – poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place.
The evidence is clear that sugary drinks are a major contributor to the increasing rates of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, reads a joint statement from the organizations.
GREEN: Hey, man, let's go and hang out, but - or hang out in a different place.
Hungary has announced that it will offer free in-vitro fertilization treatments, the latest major initiative to try to boost the country's population numbers, which have been declining for decades.
Democrats are unlikely to accept the majority of those ideas. They insist that Biden is committed to these programs and they insist that there will be some other way to make them permanent — though they haven't outlined any specific ways to forge bipartisan agreement.
Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., began pushing over the weekend for many of the items in the new bill.
Despite the funding of popular programs, the tax is controversial in the city. Last fall, a poll from The Pew Charitable Trusts, found 54 percent of residents endorsed the City Council's decision to impose a beverage tax. Forty-two percent did not endorse it. A more recent survey commissioned by the industry-funded Ax The Bev Tax coalition found a majority of residents (58 percent) oppose the tax.
Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of the ACLU, says that there's a potential future battle over the exemptions.
DETROW: What's your response to that?
Dreamers' lives were thrown into chaos when the Trump administration tried to terminate the DACA program without obeying the law. Tonight's ruling is a huge step in the right direction.
SETH WECHSLER: I think many of the folks who didn't move out to Kansas City would jump at an opportunity to return. And a job at ERS is something of a dream job.
GINGRICH: Right. And at two levels. One is, I should have gone to the floor the next day and corrected it. And the other is, it's a good reminder to politicians not to go and talk to reporters.
RUBENSTEIN: We hold these truths to be self-evident that...
This migration trend has only accelerated during the pandemic, and it has spread to places near Jackson, like Pinedale.
In a separate case in Virginia, Manafort was found guilty on eight counts in a sprawling bank and tax fraud case. He faces up to 24 years in prison and tens of millions of dollars in possible fines for that conviction.
The Vermont senator now has a lot of clout within the Democratic Party, and is in the position to demand some changes.
HORSLEY: A little bit, yes. This is the first time since the financial crisis that the Fed has cut interest rates outside one of its regularly scheduled meetings. And the cut was twice as large as what the Fed ordinarily does. That gives you some idea of just how seriously the central bank is taking the threat posed by the coronavirus.
NPR's Rob Stein contributed to this report.
MARTIN: Fernando, I'm going to start with you because you've been reporting on this. This isn't the first time the president has said that he wants to bring immigration reform to the table, and now the speaker has said the same thing, or he said that he's hopeful. Could it be that the stars are aligned that this will now happen?
FOLKENFLIK: Yeah, I think we got a fairly reasonable accounting. We don't know all the answers, perhaps. But there's real itemization of money and where it went. And a lot of that relied on reporters making calls and getting confirmation. But Trump himself came forward and identified groups and talked about the levels of contributions. And there was much more information this week than we had just a few days ago. The process worked. I mean, Trump has been bashing the heck out of the press as a result of it. But the press was able to hold him accountable.
The answer to that is hard to determine. The bill as laid out right now isn't very specific on how revenues would be raised, as the Kaiser Family Foundation's Larry Levitt told NPR.
A graduate of Wellesley College, Wertheimer received its highest alumni honor in 1985, the Distinguished Alumna Achievement Award. Wertheimer holds honorary degrees from Colby College, Wheaton College, and Illinois Wesleyan University.
After he threatened to withhold his support for the bill, colleagues agreed to sweeten the child tax credit, which Rubio called a solid step towards broader reforms which are both Pro-Growth and Pro-Worker.
INSKEEP: Let's acknowledge the manufacturing growth under President Trump. But when you said manufacturing jobs went down under President Obama, what you mean is, went down a lot at the beginning of the Great Recession and then went back up again strongly in the last years of Obama's time, isn't that true?
That was the year I was born, says Pettersen, also a Democrat. Unfortunately, we haven't come very far from 1981.
The Walt Disney Co. and its Marvel subsidiary threatened Wednesday to stop film production in Georgia if the governor signs a controversial religious liberty bill into law — which would be a major blow to the state's burgeoning film industry.
You know it's amazing, I mention food stamps and that guy who's seriously overweight went crazy, Trump said, as the crowd cheered. He went crazy.
Maine's Gov. Janet Mills has said that if people think they can escape the virus by fleeing North, think again.
And at Breitbart, that's really what he did. He sort of - it became the platform for the alt-right. When I spoke on Election Day to a white nationalist leader named Matthew Heimbach as the sort of results became clear, I said, you know, how are you feeling? And he said vindicated. And what he said was that this campaign and that the victory of Donald Trump has shown that there is an appetite out there for his ideas, even if people can't quite bring themselves to say so.
This year, they'll have to work especially hard if they want the vote of union member Barry Allison, a 37-year-old crane operator at the Timken Steel plant. He voted for President Obama twice. Pondering his choices this year, he said, I'm not sure yet. I'm not sure. Then, My main concern is with Hillary Clinton. I don't know if I trust her. And with the Benghazi thing, I don't know. He said between Clinton and Trump, I don't think there's much of a choice.
You know, whoever is president in 2021, it's basically like coming to a party after the party is over. And the only thing left to do is to wash the dirty dishes. And the next few months will be - you know, the government will hand out trillions of dollars. So it's extremely crucial to understand the choices we are facing and to focus attention not just on the limited health issues of how many new cases or how many ventilators in New York but to focus on the political level because the choices we face are in the end political of what is more important and who should get the resources.

Sixty-one percent of Americans believe Trump has done more to divide the country than to unite it, according to a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. A year into office, Trump's approval ratings are at record-low levels, and a majority of Americans see his first year as a failure.
It's not about hauling people into court and getting them to pay these fines. It's about negotiating the settlement so the person actually licenses the work the way they should've.
That's when former Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., delivered his famous thumbs down, ending GOP hopes of a speedy repeal. At the time, McCain was battling the brain cancer that would eventually end his life. A few days earlier, when he first returned to the Senate after cancer surgery, McCain decried the bitter partisanship behind the push to repeal the ACA through a partisan tool — reconciliation.
But the people of A.C. are determined to turn things around. You've got a city council and a mayor working hand in hand. And if your governor would start doing his job instead of — instead of following Donald Trump around holding his coat, maybe we could really get New Jersey's economy moving again.

But when I pointed out that Shrodek himself just said this area is never coming back, that the jobs that are gone are gone forever, no matter what Trump says, he replied, If he accomplishes 10 percent of what he says he's going to do, then that's 10 percent more than anybody else is gonna do.
TOM FULLERTON: In any given year, anywhere between 8% and 14% of total retail sales go to residents from northern Mexico.
Gas companies agree that gas use will have to decline as the world shifts to completely zero out carbon emissions. NW Natural's plan includes more energy efficiency, and it also offers customers carbon offsets for a small fee. By switching to renewable gas, the company hopes to have a place in a net-zero future — even if it is a smaller one.
Approximately 50,000 people are experiencing homelessness in and around L.A., according to the latest count by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. The vast majority of them live unsheltered on the streets. According to city officials and nonprofit leaders, there's a growing frustration among L.A. residents who — despite the city's big new investments in housing and services — continue to confront L.A.'s homeless crisis in their daily lives.

DAN EVANS: I don't know where to start. I mean, it's - I hate to tell you this, but what you are talking about is pure gibberish. It is nonsense. It is ridiculous.
Ms. TUCKER: I am utterly fascinated. Andrew Breitbart, of course, is a very conservative activist. For the most part, sitting Republicans have avoided suggesting that John Lewis is a liar. I think that there are two things that are interesting about this. And one is that the Tea Party movement is clearly, extremely defensive about its image and any allegations that there is a racist fringe associated with it. And I happen to agree with Lenny on this point. I think those in the Tea Party movement who are actually outright racist are probably a small minority of that group.
According to California officials, most of the money in Newsom's plan, or about $750 million, would be placed in a special fund to pay the rent of individuals facing homelessness and to spur the building of affordable housing.
It was just months ago that she pleaded guilty to federal fraud, tax and conspiracy charges over a scheme involving sales of her self-published Healthy Holly children's books.
ALEX BOLTON: Thanks for having me.
I'll tell you there's no place like Atlantic City. I mean just think, the history, the boardwalk, saltwater taffy — it's no wonder that families come back year after year.
Nonetheless, Mukuria says Kenya should be proud of its progressive menstrual policies — which wouldn't have been possible without political pressure. She gives a lot of credit to the country's female leaders as well as the men who have taken on this issue. She cites the late Mutula Kilonzo, a former education minister, who recalled that during his childhood in the 1950s, he was always trying to keep up in school with one boy and one girl — until the girl got her period. She dropped out in seventh grade.
Just a week ago, the U.S. arrested a mid-level ISIS leader. And here in Iraq, ISIS is still deadly to U.S. forces. A few days ago, two Marines were killed in the mountains - actually, you can see them from here - searching a tunnel used by ISIS. U.S. officers tell us that they must keep pressure on the Islamic State in both Iraq and Syria so it doesn't rise again.
It says that 25 percent of the Tea Partiers versus 11 percent of the general public believes the Obama White House disproportionately favors blacks over whites. And I want to know what's your take on this.
Update at 7:46 p.m. ET. On Climate Change:
Restricting immigration appears to be top-of-mind for Trump's presidency, at least initially. In his 100-day plan, Trump promised to cancel federal funding to sanctuary cities, though he hasn't specified which funds he would cut. There's no legal definition for this type of city; it's used to describe places with policies limiting how much local authorities can collaborate with federal authorities on immigration issues, such as detention requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to CNN.
Anzalone: No one life is greater than the other.
The centerpiece is a proposed one-time investment of $1 billion to increase the supply of child care to underserved populations. States would apply for funding and could use it to encourage employers large and small to invest in child care or to support child care providers that operate during nontraditional work hours or that cater to parents who are enrolled in school.
Republicans have outlined the framework for their tax bill that aims to reduce the corporate and individual tax rate, collapse individual tax brackets from seven to three and eliminate certain deductions to help pay for it.
The trouble is, we really don't have a good way to measure what the effects on growth are, because once we have the rate cut, other things start happening over time, says Jennifer Blouin, professor of accounting at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.
MICHAEL LEACHMAN: Many families are having trouble getting food on the table. More than a third of adults who are renting are having trouble paying the rent. That adds up to costs to states and localities to help those people and businesses make it through and get back on their feet.
The International Council of Beverages Associations, which represents soda companies and other beverage-makers around the globe, says it's disappointed with the new WHO report. We strongly disagree with the committee's recommendation to tax beverages, as it is an unproven idea that has not been shown to improve public health based on global experiences to date, an ICBA release concludes.
SWINTON BYRNE: (As Julie) Well, I am. But I'm creating something new with it.
So we end this campaign season with social media platforms seemingly hardwired for political argument, obfuscation and division. We are a public more concerned with scandal than policy, at least according to the social media data. And our candidates for higher office, led by Trump, seem more inclined to adopt the combative nature of social media than ever before.
President Trump persuaded Guatemala to agree to keep asylum-seekers from other countries rather than let them travel north. But it's unclear whether Guatemala can fulfill the deal.
ROBIN ROBERTS: Do you have an announcement you'd like to make?
This discouragement, this is going to have a real impact on the Internet as we know it, which is increasingly going to move to a paid experience, which again, benefits Apple's bottom line, Satterfield said.

MARTIN: Charlie, I have to give you the last word. I wanted to give Kathleen a chance to get another bite of that apple, so we'll have to have you back so you can talk more about your perspective on this. That was conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes, an author of a number of books and a columnist. Maryland Democratic Party chair Kathleen Matthews was with us. Also, Virginia Republican Puneet Ahluwalia here in our Washington, D.C., studios. Thank you all so much for speaking with us. More to come.
I think this so important to keep the youngsters interested in manufacturing, the CEO says. And this starts at the schools ... to have the kids running around with open eyes being interested in technical issues, see how things get done and really get them motivated on how to do that.
SIMON: Yes, well, I'm not a conventional conservative at all. First of all, I was almost fully on the left when I was young, so I just call it as I see it. And I thought that Trump, at his best, is the most interesting thing around and that he had the most potential to make real change in a country that's become somewhat moribund. And he has a chance to shake things up a bit. And I admit that that's the old bohemian in me, too, because I like to see things - like Jefferson famously said - what? - every 10 years there should be a revolution. Well, I think, you know, there should be. But I'd like a free-market revolution because I don't believe in socialism.
SNELL: They do. They will be transmitted in a ceremonial process after the House vote. They'll be walked in a box from the House floor to the Senate floor where they'll be received by the secretary of the Senate, which kicks off this kind of pretrial housekeeping part of the process.
Trump's Tariffs Worry A Small Steel City In Pennsylvania
In Khairallah's clinic, which is run mostly by volunteers, the cost of a visit is about $5 and is waived for those who can't afford it. More than 30 doctors serve on a rotating basis, providing specialized care in cardiology, pediatrics, gynecology and orthopedics. Khairallah also corralled pharmacies to donate certain medicines.
So what that is telling me is that the carriers think that we're making changes in the positive direction, he says. And we expect that other carriers would be interested in joining our exchange with that.
So I decided to take this issue on from a perspective of not wanting to have to prosecute those kids later in their life. So the issue that I took on it was to put a spotlight of your public safety on the issue of the education of these children, to hopefully get you to prioritize their education and to say, 'Let's put all the resources possible into making sure that they are in school.' And I'll tell you frankly the other reason was to put a spotlight on the fact that the school districts and the people who had a responsibility to make sure these kids weren't getting all of the resources they needed, to put a spotlight on the fact that that wasn't happening and it needed to happen.
So what happened yesterday gives us some really important hints on how he plans to solve this problem. First of all, by dumping the current Cabinet, he's responding to dissatisfaction among Russians about a sluggish economy. He's getting rid of a very unpopular prime minister. And more long term, Putin is signaling with these constitutional changes that he does not plan to stay in the office of president indefinitely. That's why he's ready to curb these presidential powers.
YUVAL NOAH HARARI: Hello. It's good to be here.
Now, as some Republicans in Congress question why COVID-19 aid for schools has not yet been spent, Rickert is just learning how much his district will get from a second relief bill approved in December.
When I was a senator from New York, I represented and worked with so many talented principled people who made their living in finance, Clinton said, but added that she also worked to hold them to high standards, But even though I represented them and did all I could to make sure they continued to prosper, I called for closing the carried interest loophole and addressing skyrocketing CEO pay.
Amid Lebanon's Economic Crisis, The Country's Health Care System Is Ailing
GREENE: All right, Mike DeBonis of The Washington Post has been covering all of this, and he's in our studio this morning.
KELLY: All right - talking there with Steven Fowler of Georgia Public Broadcasting, Abigail Censky of WKAR in Lansing, Mich., and Ben Giles of KJZZ in Phoenix, Ariz., getting a roundup of steps underway in their states to change voting laws in the wake of the 2020 election. Thanks, all three of you.
More concerning, Levitt said, are proposals such as Price's that could give workers who now rely on company health plans the option of instead using tax credits to buy individual coverage outside their company's plan. While offering workers more choice — a Republican goal — it would also erode the ACA's firewall that protects employer coverage from market turbulence.
He says his concern with the way things are right now is not just the financial burden he feels in paying for his employees' benefits, though that's part of it.
Tariffs — they may help some people, but they're gonna hurt a lot of people too. I don't know exactly how you balance that, Moore said. Maybe it's not the right time for tariffs. Maybe, he says, the president ought to focus more on wages and jobs instead.
Hazel ruled that the plaintiffs did not provide enough evidence to prove two additional claims — that adding the question was intended to discriminate against Latinos, Asian-Americans and immigrants; and that it was part of a conspiracy within the Trump administration to violate the constitutional rights of noncitizens and people of color.
Republicans have generally rejected the need for such a sweeping relief package. Many, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., say Congress should wait to see the economic impact of the relief measures that were approved in December. Democrats, including Biden, have insisted that more relief is needed now, particularly for lower-wage workers and people who have been unable to find new jobs in the pandemic.
The House will need to revote on the final version of the bill before it can be signed into law. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said in a statement Saturday that the House will vote on an identical measure on Tuesday.
An additional $60 million will go to the Department of Veterans Affairs for testing veterans, $64 million to the Indian Health Service for testing members of Native American tribes and $1 billion to the National Disaster Medical System for reimbursing testing costs for those without health insurance.
While Apple CEO Tim Cook has said the move is about giving people more control over data collection practices he sees as intrusive, Facebook officials argue Apple is acting out of self-interest.
MARTIN: And then you started working for Intuit, which makes financial and tax preparations software like QuickBooks, Mint or TurboTax - a lot of people would've heard of those and we just talked about those just a couple of minutes ago. What do you think you can do that these products don't do?
WARREN: Always good to talk to you. Thank you.
As Trump talked about the challenges, she framed it in a way that Democrats have for years — not as a mom's problem or a families' problem but as an impediment to economic growth.
Those two tweets seem reasonable enough. But there was more. In response to the Bush campaign's response, Team Clinton scratched out the words in Bush's redone graphic, added its own scribbled letters, and etched a large F on top, for the grade given to Florida for college affordability under Jeb Bush's leadership. The campaign tweeted the image with the caption Fixed it for you.
INSLEE: I learned that the most important renewable fuel in America is the power of perseverance. And we persevered, and we now have won. What I've also learned - and this is very important - is that a pricing system on carbon is not the only game in town. There are multiple tools in the tool box. There are many policies that we can adopt. We've seen them work in other jurisdictions and other nations, and now we've put them in place in the state of Washington.

This move is done for the benefit of the Saudi population, for the Saudi economy, and for making the vision possible, he says.
And we put all of that stuff into a mountain of financial and nonfinancial models so that we can get ahead of you a little bit. We can make some predictions about what you're likely to do. And it's from those predictions that we're able to sit down with you at a time when you are thinking or in that moment when you're about to buy those shoes and remind you of those things, reinforce for you those kinds of behaviors that end up giving you better financial outcomes.
BALABAN: Distilleries around the country have been halting regular production and using their high-proof alcohol to make hand sanitizer. And, as of Wednesday night, they now have the official government seal of approval.
MANDEL: Not remotely, no. I think this is a massive miscalculation on the part of House Democrats to step up sort of the rhetoric about a constitutional crisis where one does not yet exist because one might become - we might get to that point at one point, and they are blowing every ounce of their credibility on this story.
FULLERTON: The traffic that would normally materialize from Ciudad Juarez and is probably going to be reduced is going to remain at home and purchase the items they would purchase here in El Paso from shopping centers in Ciudad Juarez.
There are some local hospitals the federal government is working with the Commonwealth to set up. But the question is, what about chronic patients who need this ongoing care - dialysis, diabetes treatments, that kind of thing? Also, as Dr. Escobar said, surgeries are being postponed, chemotherapy treatments. So lot of questions right now about people going to get health care here in Puerto Rico.
BALABAN: Cotton mixes it all up with an immersion blender.
Republicans have balked at the price tag of Biden's $1.9 trillion package, especially coming weeks after then-President Donald Trump signed a $900 billion relief measure into law. The proposal from the 10 lawmakers is estimated to cost $618 billion.
California Has Ingredients To 'Make The Individual Market Work'
SJX Jet Boats is one of several businesses that Orofino attracted as the town has tried to diversify away from just timber and into what locals call recreation manufacturing: jet boats for Idaho's trout streams, rifles and scopes for elk hunting.
Trade has big benefits, and I am in favor of trade. But I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. Isolation is not an option, only great and well-crafted trade deals are.
ROMER: To which Larry's attorney replied, Larry didn't know any better, which is generally not a great legal argument, but in tax cases it can work. Because the tax code is so complicated, ignorance of the law is a legitimate defense. Also, for the years in question, Larry had lost a lot of money to investment scams. Because of all those losses, he didn't have much income to tax. In the end, Larry plead guilty to three misdemeanors and paid a $50,000 fine.
MITCH MCCONNELL: Case closed, case closed.
COHN: Unquestionably. People who provide direct care, that is such a hard job. It requires a combination of skills that you learn and talent that some people have. And they're paid ridiculously low, frequently without benefits. The facilities themselves are frequently understaffed. You know, it was - it's been heartbreaking to me during the pandemic to see how many, not just residents of long-term care facilities were suffering, but staff, who, you know, especially, you know, obviously, at the beginning, they didn't have enough protective gear. Some of them still don't have enough protective gear but were being asked to bear such a burden, you know, both taking care of these people who lived in these facilities and also, frankly, provide a lot of the emotional support for families like mine that couldn't be there physically.
It's basically about connections, nepotism — friendships that turn into business. It is the whole way of operating that's on trial, really, says Ana Romero, a renowned Spanish journalist and author of a recent book about Spain's royals. It's about politicians doing favors to have power and money. It's a very old story — and it's sad, actually, what it tells you about Spain.
Farrell has gotten rusty. It has struggled financially in recent decades, though Ceci says the city was finally doing a bit better because of NLMK.
How Poverty Makes Workers Less Productive
That study also raised the question of knock-on effects of taxes on employers: on the one hand, the study pointed out, not paying premiums anymore could mean more compensation for some workers. On the other hand, new payroll taxes could mean reduced wages at some businesses.
We saved almost $50 million, he says, in just one year, and cut kickbacks by the same amount. Do you think anyone says thank you?
3. Who wants the Johnson Amendment repealed?
This had absolutely nothing to do with the president or his victorious 2016 presidential campaign, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday. It is totally unrelated.
MARTIN: Wow. So as you know, the federal response to this crisis has been criticized as being so slow. What have you been able to learn about why it's taken so long to get fuel and other supplies to the people who need it?
Loyal Nine insures about a dozen employees, who must meet a $3,000 deductible before coverage kicks in. Subsidizing employee coverage makes sense, Myers says — good workers who have health insurance are more likely to stay in the job.
It was a presidential speech even down to the atmospherics. He gave it in Constitution Hall in Philadelphia. He and his wife, Jill, were dressed a little more formally than they have been on other primary nights. Everything about his speech last night was meant to meet the moment. The moment, of course, is a public health crisis, not just a primary.
I've been telling these Republicans, get rid of Section 230. And for some reason, Mitch and the group, they don't want to put it in there and they don't realize that that's going to be the end of the Republican Party as we know it, but it's never going to be the end of us. Never. Let them get out. Let, let the weak ones get out. This is a time for strength.
Mathew Staver, founder and chairman of the evangelical Liberty Counsel, said he was pleased with the order, telling NPR that Trump set forth the general policy of protecting religious freedom. He emphasized the possibility of future action by individual agencies.
The Clinton Foundation is where Bill Clinton focused his efforts after leaving office in 2001. Initially formed to raise funds for and build Clinton's presidential library, the foundation morphed into one of the world's most ambitious nonprofit organizations over the past 16 years.
To parents, I understand the pain and pressure caused by today's strike. I want you to know, I am working to get this 20 percent raise passed at the Legislature. But we need your help to make it a reality, he said in a statement Thursday, encouraging parents to contact their legislators over the matter.
House Gives Final Approval To $1.9 Trillion COVID-19 Relief Package
She met with aldermen about an executive order she had said she would sign on her first day in office that would curtail an unwritten custom, known as aldermanic prerogative, that gives local aldermen the final say over permits and zoning in their wards. Critics have long said that unilateral power leads to corruption, but many aldermen were not on board with Lightfoot's proposed changes after last week's meetings.
It's a point economists generally agree on: In a 2012 survey, 85 percent of top economists agreed that freer trade improves productive efficiency and offers consumers better choices, and in the long run these gains are much larger than any effects on employment. Likewise, 85 percent also agreed that on average, citizens of the U.S. have been better off with the North American Free Trade Agreement than they would have been without it — and as he did often during the campaign, Trump continued to slam NAFTA Thursday night.
State Rep. Grant said he was frustrated that no Republican-leaning counties have developed a process for waiving financial obligations and granting voting rights to people with felony convictions.
The briefing on Tuesday comes as the White House is beginning outreach to lawmakers about possible measures to protect workers and small businesses affected by the virus. While President Trump has promised action, officials have not yet announced any specific agreements.

Trump Again Proposes Slashing Foreign Aid In Budget
Lebanon was once proud of its health care sector, despite the corruption, but things are different now, she says.
Cash will be king (of aid)
For the past seven years, our goal has been a growing economy that works better for everybody. We've made progress. But we need to make more. And despite all the political arguments we've had these past few years, there are some areas where Americans broadly agree.
Right. Several organizations, including NPR, have fired or suspended male executives accused of sexual harassment. Now there are these allegations against a sitting senator. We're talking about Minnesota Democrat Al Franken. Leeann Tweeden, who is a Los Angeles radio broadcaster, says that the Minnesota lawmaker forcibly kissed her and groped her back in 2006. Here she is describing this on CNN.
MARTIN: That's Congressman Don Young, the dean of the House. He was kind enough to host us in his office on Capitol Hill. Congressman Young, thanks so much for speaking with us.
I think what makes this proposal so exciting is that in one fell swoop, it'll essentially lower the child poverty rate by more than 40%.
MANN: No. And this, again, is why this is so controversial. These health care and drug companies have done really well financially over the last year. But Cardinal Health has confirmed it still plans to use that pandemic tax benefit to recoup as much as $420 million in taxes already paid out. The company sent a statement to NPR, saying their tax plan is, quote, permissible under federal law. But Congressman Gomez described this use of the CARES Act as outrageous and wrong. His committee, the House Oversight and Reform Committee, sent letters to all of these companies asking for more information about their tax strategies. We expect to hear some answers to those questions by next week.
First, it vastly expands the amount of money provided to families — 50% to 80% more for each child.
Shalke, the young grape farmer, says his heart is with his fellow farmers who've been protesting – even if they don't share all the same concerns.
GREEN: Sure, so we work as a part of a series of tools - I think is probably the best way to frame that up. Where Quantified Self plays a role is in helping us coach you to making those better decisions. So as it happens, if you look at the work of a bunch of cognitive scientists or behavioral economists or people who study how we think and what we do and what happens when we do the things we do, you find that we don't always make the best decisions. We don't always make the best choices, and that in some ways we're wired not to make those choices so great.
EISBRENNER: As far as firing Comey, yeah. I'd say that was the right thing to do. That's his prerogative. You know, they keep trying to tie it to this Russian collusion.
Republicans have argued that they were effectively shut out of the process through reconciliation and that the package is too broad, saying only 9% of the funds go directly toward COVID-19 relief. Both House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have labeled the bill a Democratic wish list.
The state-owned entity which dominated the sale, has never held federal oil leases before.
Mr. Mayorkas has not adequately explained how he will enforce federal law and secure the southern border given President-elect Biden's promise to roll back major enforcement and security measures, Hawley said, going on to cite Trump's border wall.
Simon Ellin, chief executive of The Recycling Association, tells Here & Now's Jeremy Hobson that the law is designed to shift consumer behavior towards the cheaper, more environmentally friendly option, though he admits the proposal does have its limitations.
At this point, without knowing more details about repeal or replacement, what we're really focused on is getting people coverage that they deserve, Frescatore says.
This [tax bill] is going to produce economic growth. The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, showed that because of the tax relief in this bill and the pro-growth provisions in this bill, particularly for businesses to expense and hire and build more factories in America, that will lead to about $1 trillion in additional revenue because of faster economic growth.
What we're addressing here is the economic disjunction in American life, said Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee. What we're asking for here is an opportunity for people at the lower end of the economic scale, the people that we depend upon every single day in America, incidentally, to get a chance.
5 Fact Checks From Trump's Cincinnati 'Thank-You Tour' Kickoff
SAGAL: Did you - I'm guessing - you were a pioneer, of course. You were the first woman, need we say, to host the evening newscast. You must have dealt with some sexism coming up.
It raises a host of questions about the status of the Republican Party, which is led in the White House by a right-wing nationalist outsider who ran against the establishment and exploited a culture seething at Washington, and in Congress by those very Washington insider establishmentarians. Who is in control?
Education Dept. Will Stop Collections On Student Borrowers In Default
FULLERTON: Several years back, unfortunately, Ciudad Juarez was going through a period of heightened narcotics-related violence and narcotics-related homicides. And back in those days, for every additional two homicides, there was a loss of about $1 million in retail activity.
Very substantial relief that's a big number, Trump said. We're also going to be talking about hourly wage earners getting help so that they can be in a position so they are not going to ever miss a paycheck, he said.
SIEGEL: (Laughter) But just to be clear, if in fact there were to be a new tax imposed at the border on things coming in from Mexico, that's not an executive action. That would have to be...
WESSEL: Well, that's kind of interesting. He did business with Donald Trump in the past. Trump actually sued him at one point over a real estate deal. They settled out of court. He seems to have stumbled into the Trump orbit in April 2016, around the time of the New York primary. I think he essentially bought a lottery ticket that's paid off handsomely. You know, some of his friends expressed surprise that he was signing up with Trump. And he told Bloomberg Businessweek in August, hey, no one's going to be like, why did he do this, if I end up in the administration.
Most people are familiar with voucher programs, where state dollars go to pay for tuition at private schools. These programs have faced constitutional challenges in Florida and elsewhere, among other reasons, because they direct public money to religiously based organizations.
It is not nearly as glamorous as I thought it would be, but I love [the] freedom. Listen · 0:49 0:49
The latest death came on Monday when a 51-year-old man jumped from a highway bridge in the French Alps. The employee, who was married with two children, left a note blaming the work atmosphere for his decision to end his life. Eight suicides have taken place since the beginning of the summer alone. One young woman jumped from her office window. Another man hanged himself in his cubicle.
President Trump's budget will propose a $54 billion increase in defense spending, while slashing domestic programs by the same amount. The president told the nation's governors on Monday that his plan puts America first, and that we're going to do more with less, and make the government lean and accountable to people.
Water taps continue to run dry
Now, anti-Trump Republicans hope to deliver a critical mass of effective attacks before the next round of primaries in Michigan, Florida, Illinois and North Carolina:
5. Boost funding for childhood cancer research
Quist, however, has his own problems with tax liens, which he has blamed on medical costs and insurance prices, according to Montana Public Radio. The GOP superPAC Congressional Leadership Fund has already hit Quist with $700,000 in attack ads, too, painting him as too liberal.
News Brief: GOP COVID-19 Relief Plan, Myanmar Coup, Russian Protests
[President Obama has enthusiastically endorsed Clinton, so it would seem unlikely that he regrets choosing her to be his secretary of state. — Tamara Keith]
KING: So Joe Biden's plan calls for a lot more spending. We have that clear. What are the other main differences, though?
How The House Tax Overhaul Bill Could Hurt Affordable Housing
Government lawyers reported Manafort had over 100 phone calls with his attorneys in the past three weeks. They made clear they were not monitoring what was discussed in his calls with lawyers but rather relying on a prison telephone log to note the calls that were taking place.
The courts are embracing this myth that this outside group money can't corrupt because it's independent and that the money will be fully disclosed — neither of these things are true in many instances, Ryan says. And you're looking at one such instance here.
THOMAS: And all of the plans and the ideas that we see that come out of the legislature are always a little bit too little and a little bit too late.
You're starting pre-ACA with an uninsurance rate of about 29 percent for young people. We see that uninsurance rate drop, over the course of the last five, six years to about 16 percent, she says. That's thanks to many factors, the expansion of Medicaid, for one, and children being able to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26.
COKIE ROBERTS, BYLINE: Hi, Renee. Hi, Kathleen.
Anzalone: What is challenging is that this is just another disaster on top of four famines in Africa and the Middle East, a cholera crisis in Yemen, protracted emergencies in Syria, Afghanistan. Donor fatigue is a significant concern. When you have this many simultaneous disasters, it's hard to draw attention to any particular one.
But, Tejada says, there's hope for students and families worried the FAFSA doesn't capture their financial situation. The one thing that people don't really know about is that, yeah, you can appeal financial aid packages that don't live up to what the actual reality of things are, he says. Whatever first offer you get doesn't have to be the final.
Joe Biden came out on top after Tuesday's six primaries. New Rochelle, N.Y., has the largest U.S. coronavirus cluster. And, U.S. troops in Syria must keep oil fields from Syrian and Russian forces.
The bill comes amid more than two years of intense lobbying on the issue in Harrisburg, as two of Pennsylvania five nuclear power plants are set to close early. Exelon is planning to shutter its Three Mile Island plant near Harrisburg this fall. FirstEnergy intends to retire its Beaver Valley plant ahead of schedule in 2021. The early closures are part of a broader trend across the U.S. as the industry has struggled amid slowing demand for electricity and competition from cheaper natural gas and renewables.
He paused and looked at the crowd. Do you want to go to Rayburn?
PR Watch's Lisa Graves says that states can overrule local laws, and that legislatures are increasingly using preemption to stop things like minimum wage increases and protections for LGBT people.
HORSLEY: Well, the real restrictions apply to travelers from continental Europe, so not the U.K. They're excluded from the U.S. for 30 days, but this doesn't apply to U.S. citizens or their immediate family members or green card holders. This was rolled out pretty abruptly. There was apparently no warning to the Europeans, and so that just added to the confusion, and the White House has had to do some cleanup on that.
Court documents unsealed on Thursday reveal that a single holdout on the jury prevented Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort from being convicted of all 18 charges facing him this week.
President Trump announced a 30-day ban on travel from European countries to the United States, beginning on Friday at midnight, in a bid to keep new cases of coronavirus from entering our shores.
At times, Romney's essay in The Washington Post sounded like a campaign manifesto for a potential 2020 primary challenge to Trump. The world needs American leadership, Romney wrote, and it is in America's interest to provide it.

CAIR is calling for more accountability to stop donors from not only giving to these anti-Muslim groups but from getting a tax break for the donation. Arain said she hopes the report will lead to more oversight in the charitable world.
The judge made a different call. In a document dated July 10 but made public on Wednesday, Ellis wrote: It is surprising and confusing when counsel identifies a problem and then opposes the most logical solution to that problem. The dissonance between defendant's motion to continue and motion opposing transfer ... cannot be easily explained or resolved.
FURMAN: Having more roads, having more ports, having a better train system will mean, over the next five, 10, 20 years, our economic growth can be stronger. We don't need to increase the deficit to get that, though. We could, for example, do what the trucking association and the Chamber of Commerce would like us to do, which is to have a higher gas tax to pay for more investments in our roads. That would make us richer over time.
Trump hopes to grow the economy by significantly lowering taxes. Under his plan, he says a middle-class family with two children would get a 35 percent income tax cut. He will also reduce the number of tax brackets from seven down to three, which would largely benefit the wealthiest Americans. When it comes to business tax rates, Trump wants to go from a 35 percent rate to 15 percent.
Renee Jerden, a choir teacher, just filed to run for state senate as a Democrat in Norman, Okla. She calls the walkout the last straw, in her decision to run for office herself.
We will not be intimidated into accepting the hoaxes and the lies that we've been forced to believe.
OSNOS: That's right, yeah. The challenge here is that in order to achieve the Iran deal at all, you had to get this kind of perfect storm in the best sense where you had to get the European countries onboard at precisely the moment that you had the United States and Iran at the bargaining table. And by reopening negotiations at a point when it's not clear that the United States is actually going to hold up its end of the deal anymore, that will, I think - Iran specialists say as much - will have the effect of driving some of the Europeans away from the table.

Instead, when she mentioned suicidal thoughts, the psychologist insisted on a psychiatric evaluation. Singh was taken by ambulance to Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y., and kept for a week on a psychiatric ward at nearby Zucker Hillside Hospital. Both institutions are part of the Northwell Health system.
We have limited resources and need to stay focused on limiting domestic spread, Nuzzo said, cautioning that if the restrictions will require additional screening and monitoring of foreign nationals entering the U.S., then this will undoubtedly divert resources from protecting vulnerable populations, like the elderly and individuals with underlying health issues.
Professor Jonathan Turley remembered Avenatti as one of the best students at George Washington University Law School — a guy who stood out in class.
The Republican plan to reshape the Affordable Care Act — what they call repeal and replace — kills the requirement that everyone buy health insurance by eliminating the tax penalty for those who don't have coverage. It also makes significant changes in the financial assistance people can receive to buy a health plan.
Proponents claim the measures are aimed at curbing illegal immigration, but Orbán's many critics charge the aim is to silence dissent and control Hungarian civil society.
You have a high number of African-Americans living and residing in Birmingham. But you have a state legislature there in Alabama that is overwhelmingly majority white and a white governor, and the city of Birmingham, in essence, feels it's not being heard. Its concerns about the minimum wage are not being heard in the state legislature. And so they move forward with rules to govern the employers in their city to provide this very modest increase in the minimum wage of an hour to increase it $2.75 an hour to increase it.
Disposable cups have a plastic lining that makes them waterproof, which means they cannot be processed by most recycling facilities, the report notes. As a result, most of them end up in landfills or are incinerated.
In another conversation, Ireland's former president, Mary Robinson, warned of a strange moment in history. Much of the world had committed itself to very strong multilateral institutions, but she says, we seem to be now going into identity nationalism in a narrow sense. Identity nationalism, concludes Pakistani writer Mohsin Hamid, is almost hopeless — and it boils down to fear of change.

INSKEEP: Yeah, Russians are furious over the way the government has treated Navalny. Someone - it's thought to be the Kremlin - poisoned Navalny over the summer. He recovered outside the country, then came back to Moscow and was immediately put in prison. Now, for two weekends in a row, Russians have come out to protest despite the dangers to their own safety from police.
Manafort: Never Mind, Please Don't Move Me To Jail Near Washington After All
What we did agree to do is to follow up and talk further at the staff level and amongst ourselves and with the president and vice president on how we can continue to work together on this very important issue, she told reporters at the White House. All of us are concerned about struggling families, teetering small businesses and overwhelmed health care system, getting vaccines out and into people's arms and strengthening our economy and addressing the public health crisis that we face.
The territories also send delegates to political conventions, such as those to nominate presidential candidates. However, the territories have no electoral votes in the presidential election.
SIMON: The argument, as I read it, Judge Ellis seemed to make is, look; this case wouldn't even be here if the government hadn't been looking into charges of Russia's intervention in the last elections and therefore he seemed to discount - he didn't say that the charges didn't exist, but he seemed to discount their importance. How do you feel about that?
MARTIN: It was the last debate before voters start picking winners and losers in the 2020 election. And the argument over who is best suited to beat Donald Trump moved to gender.
Picking a fight with the leader of his party the day before being sworn in, former GOP presidential candidate and incoming freshman Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, writes that President Trump has not risen to the mantle of the office.

[This week Clinton's campaign launched an initiative called Together For America, designed to reach out to Republicans and Independents who could be persuaded to vote for her. But it's unlikely she will be swaying them on policy. She hasn't moderated her positions at all since the primary. Instead she and her campaign seem to be making a pitch based largely on temperament and values, not on taxes, college affordability or health care policy. One Republican I interviewed who is supporting Clinton over Trump said You have to have a hierarchy of principles at a time like this. And in 2016, tax policy has moved down on his priorities list. -Tamara Keith]
YGLESIAS: It's strange. When I heard the audio again, when we just played it before, it was interesting. Trump appeared to have misunderstood the question, it seemed to me, and was saying that he did not try to get Comey to swear an oath of loyalty to him under oath, you know? And so I think it's very possible that they're going to try to wiggle out of this commitment that we thought we heard.
House Panel Plans Contempt Vote For Barr Over Mueller Report

No one wants to be the square who hates rock 'n' roll. And no one wants to be establishment in the 2016 presidential race. Hillary Clinton quickly distanced herself from the label when Bernie Sanders used it against her in the last presidential debate. Republican Jeb Bush only grudgingly accepted the label.
COURIC: So, you know, I had to ask him about Iran-Contra and all these things that were in the news. But I hadn't really thought about it because I wasn't prepared to do the interview. So that was sort of where the rubber met the road, and I was able to pull it off. So I think I did get some attention for that.
CBO estimated in 2015 that canceling the cuts would boost federal spending by $879 billion from 2016 to 2025.
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: It is encouraging, as we called out yesterday, to see construction companies all across America that are, as we speak, checking their supplies and donating those industrial masks to their local hospitals.

We're going to take the risk now of reporting on the future. You have to do that with care. You never get any firsthand information from there. But economists do make forecasts to which businesses respond, so it's important. And the White House is issuing its annual economic report, which includes an optimistic forecast for economic growth, more optimistic than some other forecasts. Kevin Hassett is chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and he's on the phone. Good morning, sir.

One of the few high-profile tech companies that was excluded from Wednesday's meeting was Twitter — Trump's preferred social platform. A Politico story suggested this was in response to Twitter rejecting the Trump campaign's #CrookedHillary emoji earlier this year.

Conant said the political backlash from the Capitol riot is likely too great for Trump to overcome.

Early Wednesday afternoon, the World Health Organization declared that the disease COVID-19, caused by coronavirus, is a pandemic. As of Tuesday, the WHO was reporting about 120,000 cases in 114 countries on six continents.
STONE: This is mostly in the hands of the federal government right now. Arizona was not one of the states that set up its own exchange. It participates in the healthcare.gov. And leading up to open enrollment last year, we saw the federal governor making efforts to woo insurers back into the marketplace, even after they were concerned about costs and losing money. The question is - will the Trump administration do the same? - and I think that's what a lot of folks who rely on the coverage right now are wondering.

Trying to stand six feet away from a person on a train or a bus is almost impossible, Schlickman says, referring to social distancing recommendations.

This is the type of district that's primed for a possible upset — even though now-Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price won re-election easily here time after time, Trump carried Georgia's 6th District by only 1 point last year after Mitt Romney won it by 23 points in 2012. This is the northern Atlanta suburbs — a growing, diverse and well-educated area, just like the places where Trump struggled mightily last fall.
GROSS: Yeah. But obviously, she was wrong because there is a place for obscenity. And that would be the place for it - is when you're...
Democrats certainly don't want to couple those programs with tax cuts they feel overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy. You didn't hear much of anything about working families, Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden told Politico. I'm certainly not going to support a tax proposal that gives crumbs to working families and cakes to the fortunate few.
LEVINE: Mr. Steyer has said that he's going to spend 30 million to help Democrats. He is really supporting the idea of impeaching the president. And so taking the House would allow that to move forward. I think that you're going to see a lot of that money flow into House races, some into Senate and gubernatorial races, which are also important this cycle.
The country is as divided as it's ever been, as pessimistic as it's been in three decades and facing health, economic and racial crises.
These new revelations follow earlier discoveries from Hofeller's hard drives, which were discovered by his estranged daughter after he died last year. They include a document with a paragraph about using the Voting Rights Act as a justification for a citizenship question. The lawsuits' plaintiffs allege that file shows Hofeller helped administration officials come up with a way to conceal their true intentions in a carefully orchestrated scheme.
Right now, I pay to have the health care, but I can't afford to use it, says Gutierrez.
There's a big philosophical split to consider, too. University of Denver political scientist Seth Masket said a lot depends on how you view the main function of a primary.
Martin Baily, an economist at the Brookings Institution and a former White House economic adviser, has studied the question. He says he thinks it would be a good thing if the U.S. had more manufacturing jobs and could provide work for people who aren't highly educated, but that such an expansion would be very difficult to achieve.
The House is on track to pass a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package, which includes another stimulus check to millions of Americans, additional unemployment benefits, and new child tax credits.
SOMMER: Yeah, he's saying that, you know, instead of maybe one banner climate bill, that Congress can kind of embed climate spending in other bills. But, you know, of course, the question is, will emissions drop fast enough just by doing that? - because, you know, as part of rejoining the Paris climate accord, you know, the Biden administration is going to have to convince the international community it can deliver on that. And, you know, it's important to say, even when the Obama administration left office, the U.S. wasn't on a path to meet its international climate targets. So now, you know, four years later, Biden is just going to have to be much more ambitious than Obama was.
Pullen says even a few years ago he would've never imagined London in such difficulty, with Paris enjoying a business renaissance.
She was worried about contracting the virus but also felt like she owed it to her residents. So, at 55 years old and with no preexisting conditions, Pineau-Chaisson put on an N95 mask and a white jumpsuit and she entered the units to help. Three days later, she had COVID-19.
[While the federal corporate tax rate is 35%, the Congressional Research Service found in 2014 that the average effective corporate tax rate was around 27% and the Government Accountability Office calculated in 2010 that profitable businesses were paying federal income taxes amounting to about 13% of their total global income. --Arnie Seipel] [Independent budget analysts have raised concerns that the 15% business rate would cause many people to quit their jobs and become independent contractors to pay lower taxes. This could cut into revenues severely. -Tamara Keith]
Every single Christian institution is wondering about that, and thinking, 'What happens if we lose government funding?'  he says. Everybody has done the math about how much money you would have to raise if you lose government funding. You can't do it.
Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it, Trump said at a debate last month. We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive.
The resolution has few details, but it aims to overhaul the U.S. economy and spread wealth more evenly. It calls for a speedy shift in energy generation, from fossil fuels to renewable sources like wind and solar, and for a fair and just transition for all communities and workers.
SHAPIRO: E.J., do you see this as a crisis?
We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and to our allies, Trump continued, highlighting the country's oppressive regime by adding some late guests with deeply emotional stories.

On Monday, I'm going to be in Scranton, Pennsylvania, with Vice President Biden. He has a saying: Don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget and I will tell you what you value.
Normally, in good times, the government seeks to balance its books a bit, borrowing less, paying off some debt or — gasp — maybe even aiming for a budget surplus. And right now, on some important measures, economic times are good. But the government has been increasing spending and cutting taxes — and the budget deficit is projected to grow to nearly $1 trillion, an increase of over 35% since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed in 2017. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve would normally be raising interest rates to make sure the price of everything doesn't get out of control. But high inflation is nowhere to be seen, and the Fed is now cutting interest rates.

Georgia's lieutenant governor has threatened to block a proposed tax break for Delta Air Lines unless the Atlanta-based carrier restores a discount program for National Rifle Association members that was pulled in the wake of the shooting in Parkland, Fla., earlier this month.
It's easy to see the downside for GameStop, a company that has closed 783 stores in two years and faces stiff headwinds. More and more game and console sales are happening online and through its competitors — Walmart, Target, Best Buy and Amazon.
When members of Congress come back from Thanksgiving break, they will start thinking about the 2018 elections. In elections earlier this month, Democrats made big gains - even bigger than they were expecting. So is a blue wave forming? NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson takes a look.
2020 Democrats Offer Up Affordable Housing Plans Amid Surging Prices
Lawmakers are also considering a plan that could distribute cash payments, among other relief measures. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced a plan on Thursday that includes cash payments of as much as $1,200 per person. The bill is being negotiated with Senate Democrats.
MARTIN: There are people who would say, yes, let's do this, and I will do my part. But there are Republicans and some Democrats who would not be so keen on having to pay any kind of higher tax in order to offset the costs of these climate proposals. Can you tell us now that you would absolutely not ask the American taxpayer to pay some of the burden here?

Nixon hoped that this would frighten the Soviet Union. It would make the Soviet Union think that he was irrational. This was known as the madman theory. And Mel Laird thought that this was a very, very dangerous thing to do. And so what he did is he dissembled. He told Nixon that actually this was a bad idea because they had a previously scheduled training exercise, and he hoped that Nixon would forget about it. Nixon still said no.
Now, it's these state-based tax breaks that are driving real concern among state leaders about Washington's recent tax overhaul.

DETROW: Agreed with almost everything Ron said, which is, you know, not new.
COHN: It does end up in a lot of compromise. And that is how the Affordable Care Act came to be and why it looks like it does.
Initially, anger surged over a new tax on Internet voice-call services, and expanded to demand the ouster of the government. The protests, peaceful for months, grew more violent in December, as riot police used water cannons, tear gas and rubber bullets to stop thousands from demonstrating in front of the parliament building.
But, he said, the industry is better able to withstand the economic shock than it was during the 2008 financial crisis. It's pretty healthy. We've all built stronger balance sheets. We've all got good liquidity. And so I think the economic backdrop for airlines is very different, Hayes said.
The protests also included a large petition drive, open letters and calls on President Jackson to resign. Some of the loudest jeers during the speech came when DeVos said she'd be visiting the gravesite of the university's founder, Mary McLeod Bethune, a daughter of former slaves and a civil rights leader. It's a complete insult, alumna Trinice McNally told NPR Ed. There is no comparison to my founder.
Well, for a start, when you have in Flint, Mich., a water system which is poisoning children, and to a lesser degree we have collapsing water systems in many communities in this country, yes, we need to invest heavily in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.
MARTIN: Right. So we should just put a pause here. The Republicans have suggested at least to give a thousand dollars to every American.
The city of Detroit is where our story begins. Detroit was once the economic envy of the world. The people of Detroit helped to power America to its position of global dominance in the 20th century.

So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week. Go there.
And Warren, you know, for her part when she was asked about this, pivoted to electability. She tried to flip this notion of who can beat Republicans on its head. And she pointed out, as we heard in that clip just a moment ago, that out on the debate stage, it's the women who have undefeated track records in elections.
BOOKER: Wow. OK, well, number one is definitely not it. And in this day and age in America and our economy, I don't think you can get much for 18 cents anymore. So I'm going to stick with traffic safety 'cause it might give me a chance to talk about the importance of infrastructure.
KASICH: ...No, I said I wouldn't involve myself in a civil war in Syria, but that's a different issue than fighting ISIS - a big distinction.
The next betrayal will be the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Hillary Clinton's closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed what I have been saying, and this is from the beginning: if sent to the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton will enact the TPP. As sure as you're sitting there. Her donors will make sure of it. A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for TPP – and it's also a vote for NAFTA.
If that's what it is, well then, really shouldn't people who are members of that party be the ones who make that decision? he said.
Voters in the Bay Area have made a decision, and we respect their decision, Susan Neely, CEO of the American Beverage Association, told us by phone.
The briefing came as the Trump administration doubled down on criticism of state leaders in California for not adequately dealing with the state's swelling homeless ranks.

With only three of the seven states in question, we win the presidency of the United States. And by the way, it's much more important today than it was 24 hours ago, because I don't. I spoke to David Perdue, what a great person, and Kelly Loeffler, two great people, but it was a setup.
President Obama implemented the program in 2012; it has protected about 800,000 people who were brought to the United States as children by their families, some of whom overstayed their visas. Under the program, young adults, often referred to as Dreamers, have been permitted to live and work legally in the U.S.

China would not be able to match tariffs on another $200 billion because it simply doesn't buy that much from the U.S. In 2017, the U.S. sold about $130 billion in goods to China, while importing some $506 billion in Chinese products.

President Trump's administration is proposing an $850 billion stimulus package to help businesses and individuals cope with the abrupt slowdown in the U.S. economy from the coronavirus and the related shutdowns. Eight-hundred-fifty billion dollars - that's the scale of bailouts during the financial crisis more than a decade ago.

Today we will see whether Republicans stand strong for integrity of our elections. But whether or not they stand strong for our country, our country. Our country has been under siege for a long time. Far longer than this four-year period. We've set it on a much greater course. So much, and we, I thought, you know, four more years. I thought it would be easy.

DIONNE: I can't resist. The, you know - and so that's striking. But I think the problem the Trump people have is they cannot talk straight about Russia. If Jeff Sessions had had a couple of meetings with the ambassador and hadn't gone out of his way to tell Al Franken on the committee in response to a question that didn't even ask him whether he had had any meetings that in fact he had had no meetings, this wouldn't be nearly as big a story.
Her speech is the latest indication that Democrats are increasingly viewing an anti-corruption reform message — a call to drain the swamp, if you will — as an argument with resonance rivaling other messages, such as a promise to check President Trump's power or their more general push to improve the health care system.

In New Mexico, the buy-in plan would be similar to the state's Medicaid program. It would be offered outside the exchange and would not require federal approval to implement. The state would provide financial assistance to help people with lower incomes buy into it.

This is something that the architects of the law always wanted to do but never had the power to do because I think they recognized early on the bill was underfunded, and there's just not enough assistance for people. People need more help buying insurance. So there would be more money for people who get subsidies now, and more people would become eligible for subsidies. People who make a little too much money to qualify for assistance now - they would get help, too. So that is in the bill. It's only temporary. That's the asterisk there. It's a two-year bump. So even if it becomes law, if they want to make that permanent, they would have to come back and extend it. But those are two very concrete steps that are now already in motion.

SMITH: Yeah. This bill is nothing like the five prior bipartisan bills, which I want to point out to all the listeners - out of those five prior COVID bills that all passed by bipartisanship that Republicans voted for, there's still over a trillion dollars of money that has not been spent in there - over a trillion. And so then they're asking for another $2 trillion. But the direct payments to workers, Republicans just want it to be targeted and timely. We put provisions in there that the Democrats rejected that would prevent prisoners from getting direct payments, would prevent illegal immigrants from getting direct payments, and the Democrats refused to have it.
JENNER: Yes, absolutely. In fact, technical corrections, as they're referred to, are inevitable in any tax bill. The interesting thing, though, is that technical corrections can't be pushed through with a 51-vote majority in the Senate like this bill is being put through. So it becomes - technical corrections would become a tax bill that's subject to amendment and all of the add-ons that the - that Congress is going to try and avoid. So what that means is that it's going to be very, very difficult to fix the bill once it gets enacted.

Erickson wants to keep Coal Creek Station open, because it's a pillar of the local economy. Other political leaders in North Dakota do, too. They're looking for a company willing to buy the plant and keep it running. And in the meantime, they don't want wind companies claiming that transmission line. Without a transmission line, there's no value in the plant, Erickson says.
MONTANARO: I think it's also important to look at issues and personal characteristics. I mean, when you look at the ABC Washington Post poll, for example, when you ask people, who's qualified to be president, 63 percent said Hillary Clinton is most qualified, and Donald Trump - only 39 percent said that he was qualified. Almost the reverse - 58 percent - said he was not qualified to be president.

It's really in the hands of Congress and our elected officials to try to find ways to bridge this gap. We need to, one, take care of the well-being of people. One of the biggest problems in starting up again and in weathering the virus itself is that so many people get sick. We need to make sure that people have expanded Medicaid in the states to have - make sure they can cover the costs of going into the hospital and being able to cover the costs of the illness. We also need to prevent the illness more. And we need to be able to help people who actually lose their jobs in firms.

It's also about the decades of attempts to provide health care coverage to Americans dating back to the 1920s.
To get the money, states would have to establish targets for reducing unnecessary regulatory or other requirements that limit the supply or increase the cost of child care. A White House aide said this isn't meant to roll back regulations on child-to-caregiver ratios but rather to get rid of zoning requirements in some areas that don't allow child care centers in residential districts, for instance.
For voters of all stripes, trade worries are amplified by more general concerns with slow growth, automation, and inequality.
Trump has steadfastly refused to release his tax returns, saying his lawyers won't allow it because he is under an IRS audit. During the campaign, he promised to release the returns once the audit is finished, but he has since backtracked on that pledge.
CORNISH: I want to ask you about some agenda items. Three of your main agenda items are about increasing funding for public education, about money for infrastructure, single-payer health care for the state - all of them expensive. And you've been criticized for being vague about how you might fund them beyond increasing taxes on the wealthy.
And I'd love to have if those tens of thousands of people would be allowed. The military, the secret service. And we want to thank you and the police law enforcement. Great. You're doing a great job.

It's important to note that union members don't always follow the advice of their leadership when it comes to the ballot box. As a group, these voters are more likely to back Democrats, but that vote still needs to be earned. Democratic candidates usually count on winning a solid majority of labor votes.

Republicans call their tax bill the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. But critics say maybe it should have been named the Tax Cut and Robots Act.
GRAVES: I think this is an example of where there's the law, and then there's tradition and practice. And so as a technical matter, as a legal matter, states are the sovereigns in this country vis-a-vis the federal government. And the state as a sovereign government, in essence, technically allows cities to exist or allows these local subdivisions of government to exist. You know, that's sort of the - as these cities have grown and thrived and we have so many more cities in the country, it's sort of the norm that we obviously have city governance.
Crucially, researchers found that raising the minimum wage appears to reduce the suicide rate more when it's harder to find a job. In bad times, the same $1 increase could save more people than it might during good times.
Republicans still make up more than half of the beneficiaries of this ad blitz — six GOP House members and three GOP Senate lawmakers will get kudos from the Koch network.

PALMIERI: It's up to them decide their leadership. I know they're doing that in December. I know that Leader Pelosi believes she has the votes to win that, and it wouldn't surprise me if she did. And I do say she's the most effective leader in the better part of the century in Congress. And I think that's why she's been attacked. So I think that list of issues that Jeff articulated is right, and...

Borrowers who have the lowest student debts are the ones who struggle the most, explains Adam Looney, an economist at the University of Utah.
Well, I think taxes are very good. I think it goes quickly. It is easily done, and etc., etc., Trump said, as reported by Buzzfeed. But building infrastructure, building great projects, putting people to work in that sense is also very good, so I think you have a combination of both, plus he is doing a rebate system, and I think that is good also.
There are really two pieces to this bill. One is directly related to the health crisis, but the other, and the larger piece, is related to the economic crisis that the health crisis has created, King told NPR's Rachel Martin on Monday.

NIXON: I have said that. But I certainly think that that is not a direction we should be moving in. We need more and more working-class people running for office and elected to office because so much now, it is white males who have access to great networks of wealth. And what we're seeing is more and more women and people of color who are saying, damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead. I'm going to speak to voters about issues that they care about.
According to Weiss-Wolf, the tampon tax was a natural starting place for her advocacy. She began working on the issue of period equity at the beginning of 2015, and the following year she teamed up with Laura Strausfeld, a lawyer looking to combat the tampon tax. Together they formed the aptly named Period Equity, an organization that works on legal cases and legislation across the country meant to combat the tampon tax.
This issue with debit cards is consistent with a pattern of the IRS failing to work with state correctional authorities to ensure that stimulus payments are reaching the people they are supposed to reach, Salahi said. We would hope that, given what happened with the first round of payments, they would have given more forethought to this and more attention to the issues that are unique to prison.
We'll compete in the world. We want to compete in the world. But we're going to compete in the world where it's a two-way road not a one-way road. The advantages are going to come back to our country, and they haven't for many many years.
But even if Congress passes a continuing resolution to keep the lights on in the government, raises the debt ceiling and gets Harvey relief funding through, that's mostly maintaining the status quo. It is hardly overhauling the health care system or tax code or rebuilding the nation's bridges and roads.

The tea party movement has grabbed a lot of media attention for its anti-big government positions, but it has also become embroiled in questions about the racial attitudes of some participants. Political commentators Cynthia Tucker of The Atlanta Journal Constitution and syndicated columnist Lenny McAllister discuss the tea party with Michel Martin.
[His numbers are right (the number of people outside the labor force has grown by 13.8 million, according to the Labor Department). However, this statistic alone is misleading. The number of people in the labor force (that is, either working or looking for a job) has also grown by more than 5 million altogether since January 2009. It's true that the labor force participation rate — the share of Americans in the labor force — is low in recent years. However, as of 2014, the Congressional Budget Office attributed half of the recent decline to simple demographics, as an aging population retires. — Danielle Kurtzleben]
Fifteen national organizations including the American Heart Association and the American Medical Association filed a friend-of-the court brief with the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania.
They're just not willing to go as far as I think we need to go, Biden said in his clearest indication that he's not waiting around for the Republican support he might never get — though his team appears to be looking outside Washington for some GOP support by appealing to state and local officials and business groups.
FAHRENTHOLD: Well, it's against tax law to buy things for yourself. It's not the kind of crime generally that sends people to jail, but it's the kind of crime that you would have to pay a penalty tax on depending on how much you broke the rules and how long it took you to report it.
Leaders around the world are facing pressure to handle the threat of the coronavirus. Today China's leader Xi Jinping visited the city of Wuhan, where the virus originated. Our reporter in Beijing says it could be a sign the government believes the worst of the emergency in China is over. In Italy, meanwhile, the prime minister has expanded quarantine measures to include the entire country. There are travel restrictions there now. And President Trump said last night, he's pushing for a payroll tax cut to try and mitigate economic damage. In the United States there are more than 700 confirmed cases, and more than two dozen people have died.
Deborah Weinstein, who heads a coalition of more than 100 national anti-poverty groups, says she doubts that dealing with the safety net will be one of Trump's initial priorities, and that's an advantage. That gives us time to mount an effort to be the strongest possible voice against dismantling programs, such as SNAP, she says.
An even bigger hurdle is the sheer unlikelihood of it all. Rieder has no illusions. In fact, he says, some countries that have successfully reduced fertility rates have since reversed course, afraid that falling population will hurt their economies. (He has an answer — just as controversial — to that, too. He would have nations open up immigration to allow in the expected tens of millions of climate refugees.) Rieder's real hope is to change people's way of thinking about childbearing.
But corporations shouldn't abandon profitable operations here to move abroad, just to give shareholders a quicker return, CEOs a bigger bonus, and unions a weaker hand to play.
Typically the goal of a sovereign default is for a country to reset its borrowings base in order to make sure it can be fiscally sustainable going forward, said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney. And creditors or lenders have an interest in participating in that process, because they believe they can get the best return from negotiation.
Those are numbers hard to recover from in the short term. And despite Biden's repeated calls for unity — which he doesn't necessarily define as bipartisan legislation — Democrats are betting that most Americans will be with them on this COVID-19 relief effort, even if it means going it alone.
NIXON: I shall resign the presidency, effective at noon tomorrow. Vice President Ford will be sworn in as president at that hour in this office.
How did Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader at the time, get the support of Bernie Sanders? And Bernie Sanders, as everybody knows, has made universal health care or, you know, Medicare for All, a signature issue for him? And this this was a real - this was a distance away from what Bernie Sanders has wanted and advocated for for years. So what did it take to get Bernie Sanders to sign on?

Expanding Social Security won't just help older Americans retire with dignity – it will ease burdens on families and communities.
Parra says politicians can steer clear by engaging the Latino electorate early on in the campaign, hiring Latino staffers who understand the nuances within the demographic, addressing the issues important to the community (like immigration) and following through on campaign promises. The way he sees it, if politicians make symbolic gestures that go nowhere, it's reasonable to wonder whether they were just Hispandering.

Several of the candidates have offered extensive plans that they say would address the housing shortage that is affecting millions of low and middle income voters. They've proposed everything from refundable tax credits for overburdened renters, to spending billions of dollars on new affordable housing. They've also raised the issue as a prime example of racial and income inequality, another focus of the Democratic campaigns.

The authors conclude that giving workers cash upfront helped alleviate the mental burden of their financial problems and freed them to be more productive. It echoes findings from other studies on the psychological consequences of poverty, but it is novel because it looked at the effects of it at a real job rather than in a laboratory setting.
FRANK MORRIS, BYLINE: U.S. Department of Agriculture researchers got crossways with the Trump administration by publishing and funding objective analysis of stuff like climate change, the efficiency of food assistance programs and tax cuts that benefit mostly the richest farmers. That's according to Tom Bewick, who's with USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture.
SALTER: It's not. The damage he's doing to our politics, to our country, to our country's reputation in the world, to our alliances - it's not worth the damage to drop a top marginal tax rate a few points. It's just not.

Last week, an earlier draft of the bill, dated Feb. 10, was leaked to Politico. Most analysts said that legislation would lead to millions of people losing coverage. And members of the House Freedom Caucus, considered the most conservative wing of the Republican Party, said they would oppose the bill because it includes refundable tax credits for people who are too poor to pay any federal income tax.

Warren and Schumer have argued the president has the power to forgive this level of debt via executive action, citing a September opinion from attorneys at Harvard's Project for Predatory Lending. Earlier this month, the White House signaled it was looking into the legality of such an executive action. In January, before Biden was sworn in, lawyers at the U.S. Department of Education issued a memo concluding that forgiving federal student loan debt via executive action would be illegal.
Even in the face of a very fuzzy future, Lee says he is focusing on the present, which includes shepherding more than 300,000 Californians newly enrolled in health care into 2017 coverage. He also wants to get the word out on parts of California's plan that can be adopted elsewhere.
In an earlier court filing, however, attorneys with the Justice Department — which is representing the administration in these cases — assert that Hofeller played little, if any, role in advocating for a citizenship question among administration officials and was not involved in drafting the administration's official letter to the Census Bureau requesting the question.

ZARROLI: Yeah, there is a federal law that says if you're selling properties or if you're selling assets for conflict of interest reasons, you don't have to pay capital gains tax. Now, there's some question about whether this would apply to Trump because he is not mandated to comply with conflict of interest laws the way, you know, Cabinet officials, other people in his administration would be.

Even if they're foreign-owned, but they have a factory in this country and they're employing American workers, to me, that's an American company, Almashy said.
STEVEN MNUCHIN: This is not going to go on forever. We are going to beat this. And while we're doing that, we understand there are impacts on hardworking Americans. And the president is determined that we are going to support them.

There are electoral stakes here. All year, Sanders has done better in contests where independents, or even registered Republicans, were allowed to participate.
We've identified the top 10 issues voters care about most according to a 2016 survey from the Pew Research Center and charted what Trump has said about each of them. The issues are, in order: the economy, terrorism, foreign policy, health care, gun policy, immigration, Social Security, education, Supreme Court appointments and the treatment of racial and ethnic minorities.

Still, if both of those taxes in the ACA were repealed, high-income Americans would collectively pay about $231 billion less in taxes over 10 years, according to the CBO analysis.
Both were accused of Hispandering: a mashup of Hispanic and pandering that means faking interest in Hispanic issues and culture for self-serving reasons.
Trump recently mused in an interview on Sirius XM that had Andrew Jackson been a little later, you wouldn't have had the Civil War. The president was returning to one the most studied eras of American history: the Antebellum Period, the decades leading up to the Civil War. The causes of the conflict can be traced back to the beginnings of the country. It is poignant and instructive to read the accounts of people who lived in the 80 years before the calamity. Many knew that something was going grievously wrong, that the political system was beginning to seize up, caught in its own contradictions. Some desperately warned against disaster. Yet no one truly foresaw what history had in store for them.

Those votes show an even deeper, more fundamental rift in the party, says Stuart Stevens, a former Republican consultant and current adviser to the anti-Trump Lincoln Project. He thinks the big divide is between authoritarians and those who believe in democracy.
Now, these teachers aren't benefit-less. The law requires that states that opt out of Social Security give teachers a pension that is at least as generous.
During his reign until his death in 2015, Saudi King Abdullah recognized the potential for economic problems and introduced some reforms. But in 2016, the now Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman launched Vision 2030, a comprehensive plan to diversify the economy and create more private sector jobs for Saudis.
So Pennsylvania was defrauded. Over 8,000 ballots in Pennsylvania were cast by people whose names and dates of birth match individuals who died in 2020 and prior to the election. Think of that.

I would say that the most crucial state for both of them is Michigan. It has the largest number of delegates at stake. But it's also about the political symbolism of that state. Recent polling shows Biden pretty comfortably in the lead here. But in 2016, Sanders defied the polls, and he beat Hillary Clinton there. So I would say, if he is to mount a comeback, he really needs to do that through Michigan. And I would say, you know, both of them want to show that they can boost key demographics that Democrats need in a general election because, I'm sure you recall, Trump actually won Michigan during the general election in '16.
Forty years ago this past week, a message was sent across ARPANET, the computer network developed by the Defense Department's Advanced Projects Agency.

Type the simple word login.
OSNOS: Yeah, that's true, and that's an explicit part of the incoming Trump administration's plan. Campaign advisers described it to me as a first-day project, by which they meant that on the first day or within a few days Donald Trump would seek to sign as many as 25 executive orders, or uses of executive power in other forms, that would, in the words of one adviser, erase the Obama presidency.
I thank God every day that it happened here, he says, and not a few miles to the west.
I believe what he meant - and he's clarified this - is, well, I was hoping to get the top income tax rate down to 25 percent from 40. Maybe we're not going to be able to get it to 25. Maybe it's going to have to be 27 or 28 percent. But still, people are going to pay lower taxes.

ELVING: Yes, a quarter to remember. We're back up about 4 percent growth. It's the best quarter in four years, on par with the best quarters of the Obama years. And the president attributed this accelerated growth to the tax cuts and reduced regulations that were his main policy thrust in 2017. And if sustained over the entire year, this will be a banner year, indeed, for the American economy. The question, of course, is whether it is sustainable as the effects of tariffs and trade war talk make their way through the economy.
It potentially allows [plans] to discriminate against people with medical conditions, which the ACA is supposed to eliminate, said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center.

Independents were certainly willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt when he entered office, Miringoff said, but on issues like the direction of the country and the economy, they've really soured on him. It's hard for someone like him to make a second impression. Independents have come to the conclusion that what you see is what you get.

One big fear of a higher minimum wage is that it could cause businesses to replace their workers with machines. Ashenfelter and Jurajda found that some McDonald's restaurants have already installed touch screens so customers can input their meal orders without interacting with a human being. But they also found that those touch screens weren't installed in response to higher minimum wages. We couldn't find any relationship between minimum wage increases and the adoption of touch-screen technology, Ashenfelter says.

ALLEN: Well, you know, Venezuelans have been coming here for more than well over a decade fleeing the economic and political turmoil back there in their home country. Those who've come here on visas like student and tourist visas that expired have long been in limbo. You know, they're unable to work, and they can't really return home safely, they feel. So under this program, they can now legally remain here and apply for work permits. It applies to people who arrived here by yesterday, March 8, and it goes for 18 months. But it is likely to be renewed as long as the conditions remain the same down there in Venezuela. In some ways, the Biden order mirrors one that was signed just weeks ago by President Trump the day before he left office. That was an order called Deferred Enforced Departure. It remains in place. They're similar programs in some ways, but lawyers say TPS may have some advantages.
In recent years, other states — including New York, Illinois, New Jersey and Connecticut — have used various, controversial mechanisms to give billions of dollars to prop up their ailing nuclear plants by recognizing them as a source of carbon-free power.

And also, if you are living in an out - where the outbreak is or around it, there - some health officials are calling for babies to get vaccinated a little bit earlier, around six months instead of the typical 12 months. But really the key is vaccination. Measles is super, super contagious. And everybody needs to be protected in order for the - for an outbreak not to occur.

Meanwhile, American households are earning more than $4,000 think of that, $4,000 less today than they were sixteen years ago. The average worker today pays 31.5 percent of their wages to income and payroll taxes. On top of that, state and local taxes consume another 10 percent. Very grim picture.

Homeland Security officials said the travel restrictions would only apply to foreign nationals, not American citizens or legal permanent residents, who have been in the Schengen region, which consists of 26 countries in Europe with open borders agreements, in the last 14 days.

The nation's journalists like to think of themselves as people who hold the powerful accountable, who are skeptical rather than cynical, constructive rather than carping, institutionally adversarial but not personally opposed. I don't think that's how the public thinks about the media. Not at all.

Spatial inequality of all sorts in cities is not our main research topic — [we] have a background which is mainly in applied mathematics and computer science, data analysis and modeling of complex social systems.
CHANG: Well, he's also making the claim that China withheld information about the coronavirus. Richard, is the president right on that front?
The higher unemployment is, the stronger that potential protective effect appears to be, says Kaufman.
During his speech, though, Trump stressed his administration's efforts in standing up for freedom and declared that the U.S. joined with more than 50 other countries to oppose the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro.
In the Senate, given Democrats just barely hold a majority, there are really only two ways to skip a bipartisan deal — try for reconciliation, or kill the filibuster.
The day before the election, the state of Pennsylvania reported the number of absentee ballots that had been sent out. Yet this number was suddenly and drastically increased by 400,000 people. It was increased, nobody knows where it came from, by 400,000 ballots, one day after the election.
Health officials say the worst of the pandemic may be behind us. The White House extends Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans. Drug firms say tax breaks will offset the opioid settlement.
KING: I want to start by asking you about testing here in the United States because we are seeing these anecdotal stories about people who want to be tested, who say they have symptoms, who say they've gone to the doctor and they cannot get the test. The president, so far, has declined to estimate how many Americans have been tested. What is the current availability of test kits across the country? Simply put, do we have enough, and are they where they need to be?
SCHUMER: OK, let me go through the others. Maybe at the top of the list, we need a massive Marshall Plan for our hospitals. We need more beds. We need more ventilators. We need more equipment. We probably need more doctors and nurses and others on board.
There's a good chance you have heard that question many times in the past few days.
N. SHAHIN: I'll actually be heading off, starting at Ford in mid-July as a Ford college graduate in one of their starter positions.
One of the most important reforms of all is trade reform. As Bernie Sanders has said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgment. We've seen this bad judgment overseas, in Libya, Iraq, and Syria. We've seen it in Iran. We've seen it from President Obama, when he gives $150 billion to Iran, the number one terror state, and even gives them $400 million in money-laundered cash as a ransom payment.
Here are answers to questions about the new enrollment option.
Fine, I'll take it, he said.
The people — the people who have profited the most, even since the Great Recession, are people who now need to give back. This country has given so much to all of us, and everybody should share the burden.
GROSS: Well, I wanted to ask you about it because it may be symptomatic of a larger problem in politics today, which is the smear campaign. You know, when you're smeared from somebody in the other party, you maybe expect it a little bit more. But when it's happening from your own party in a primary, is it more surprising, and does it make it more difficult to feel really united with your party when you know people within that party have lied about you in such a really destructive way?
You look back and think about how some of that money could have been used to educate people on Trump's real position on a lot of issues, as opposed to effectively ignoring him and expecting it would go away, Brian Walsh, a Republican consultant and strategist, told NPR.
MARTIN: Wow. So the U.S. is trying to build up the Kurds' ability to fight ISIS in the region. I mean, what is the status...
I read it about Bill Barr, that he's my personal attorney. That he'll do anything for me. And I said, You know, it really is genius. Because what they do is that, and it makes it really impossible for them to ever give you a victory, because all of a sudden Bill Barr changed. If you hadn't noticed. I like Bill Barr, but he changed, because he didn't want to be considered my personal attorney.
As part of this new future, we will also be rolling out proposals to increase choice and reduce cost in childcare, offering much-needed relief to American families. I will unveil my plan on this in the coming weeks that I have been working on with my daughter Ivanka and an incredible team of experts. Likewise, our education reforms will help parents send their kids to a school of their choice. We will also give our police and law enforcement the funds and support they need to restore law and order to this country. Without security, there can be no prosperity. We must have law and order. In the coming days, we will be rolling out plans on all of these items. One of my first acts as President will be to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, saving another 2 million American jobs.
In the economist's utopian vision of the stock market, clearheaded investors diligently evaluate companies and invest only in the ones they expect to grow and thrive. In the process, investors direct resources where they'll be most productive, benefiting the overall economy.
About 43 million student borrowers owe the U.S. government $1.5 trillion, according to the U.S. Department of Education. And until now, the department has only offered student loan forgiveness or cancellation to borrowers who meet certain criteria.
By the way, this is a health issue, too. This is just not an economic issue - 10,000 to 15,000 more people die of pollution from automobiles today than in car crashes. This is a national security issue. People say this is a single issue. This is all of these issues. And so these are investments that the vast majority are going to come from the private sector and private companies, not from the government. But the government does have a role, as it did when we went to the moon, as it did when we defeated fascism. And we're calling for an appropriate public investment to do that.
Even if it's just to take her to the zoo for a day — just to give her something of a treat, Cordeiro said. We don't really get to do that, because I have to work.
Too much emphasis in mass market books about menopause, she says, is placed on menopause treatments (or lack thereof).
SAGAL: Oh, I'm sorry, something like 19 minutes and 20 seconds.
SCHUMER: Well, I'm not saying it's a bad idea; I'm saying it's not sufficient at all.
So, perhaps Sanders will make a push the party to embrace open primaries at the Democratic National Convention this summer.

The agency's decision would provide lucrative incentives to the drug's maker, Gilead Sciences, and could keep lower-priced generic versions of the medicine off the market for several years if remdesivir is approved for use, public health advocates say.
Private health insurance will be made available to individuals and small companies through exchanges that will be run by the states. Individuals who do not buy insurance face fines, as do most employers who do not offer coverage to workers.
This is our chance and this is our moment, said Ryan. It's a big moment. And I think our members are beginning to appreciate just what kind of a rendezvous with destiny we have right here.
States including Missouri and Mississippi passed laws aimed at dismantling Roe v. Wade. California is taking steps to try to affirm abortion rights. Lawmakers there are expected to pass a bill that requires health clinics at public universities to provide the abortion pill on campus. From KQED in San Francisco, April Dembosky reports the law would be the first of its kind in the country.

DEBONIS: Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. And, you know, that's a whole factor that has yet to be resolved. It's in the bill that came out of the committee. But there are still senators who basically view this as inviting the skunk into the garden party. And they're now going to have to deal with, do we really want to insert the health care and all the politics around that into this tax bill that we all agree we really have to pass?
It was the notion that affairs in the United States were run from a secret control center, a belief held by leaders in Russia including those of its intelligence agencies in what Andrew and Mitrokhin called Moscow Center.
DAVIES: You talk to some experienced people in immigration for your piece in The New Yorker about what it would take to affirmatively go out and find millions of undocumented workers and get them out of the country. You want to share a bit of that with us?
SWONK: (Laughter) It leaves me a little speechless. I think we need a lot more active testing and more active well-being. Taking care of our people, at the end of the day, is what our government is meant to do. We need to take care of our well-being to weather the storm.
LAFFER: Why, you know, you want to make it bipartisan. And you try to convince the others of your logic, and they try to convince you. And hopefully, you can make some ground. Now, I've done some stuff with Al Gore historically. And I'm all for a carbon tax if you were willing to offset it with a 100-percent static (unintelligible), income tax or payroll tax. So is Al. I mean, that's the type of bipartisan stuff I think we should be able to do. But this is...
Trump is set to arrive in Davos on Thursday morning and will meet that day with British Prime Minister Theresa May. Earlier this month, the president canceled plans to attend the opening of a new U.S. Embassy in London.
Secular stagnation, he says, may be the defining macro-economic challenge of our times.
But there is enormous interest and concern, among business executives who specialize in health benefits, in what a Republican plan might look like. A post-election session on repeal and replacement aimed at these executives drew the biggest webinar audience ever for the National Business Group on Health, said Steve Wojcik, the advocacy and research group's vice president of public policy.
It is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different, he says, meaning inequality will deepen, despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it.
This came just after an announcement that House and Senate GOP lawmakers have agreed on a final tax package.
In an email to all House GOP offices, House Republican Whip Steve Scalise said the new legislative proposal from Pelosi is aimed at exploiting the COVID-19 public health crisis by attempting to force the inclusion of a socialist wish list of policies that have nothing to do with the public health and economic emergency.
Mr. Dingell had a piece of me yesterday for quite some time, Stupak told reporters Sunday.
BQ: You're not talking about renegotiating sovereign bonds that the U.S. has already issued. DT: No, I don't want to renegotiate the bonds, but I think you can do discounting. I think depending on where interest rates are, I think you can buy back. I'm not talking about with a renegotiation, but you can buy back at discounts, you can do things at discounts. I'm not even suggesting that we don't borrow money at very low rates long term so we don't have to worry about when they come due.
It's an uphill battle. A recent Washington Post-Ipsos poll found that 8 in 10 black Americans say they believe Trump is a racist, and 9 in 10 disapprove of his job performance.
GREEN: Ooh. Well, so I think it's good to think about how those tools generally get used, to understand the differences that we have. In general, when people are using a tool like Mint or Quicken, or even some of the others that are out there, they are focused in a pretty serious way. They're concentrated on trying to figure out what's going on with their taxes. There's a whole decision-making process that goes on there. But the vast majority of our time is spent away from that kind of decision-making.

Democrats won't let us fund hospitals or save small businesses unless they get to dust off the Green New Deal, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday.
SIEGEL: OK. That's NPR's Mara Liasson at the White House. Thanks, Mara.
Report: Rural Poverty In America Is 'An Emergency'
It's an idea that has been gaining popularity for more than two decades: Instead of giving poor people goods and services — say, a cow or job training — why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it?
We can't possibly fact-check whether Trump never heard of any stimulus projects, so we'll have to leave that one a mystery.
And, for now, they are giddy about passing landmark legislation to provide insurance to 32 million Americans.
Democrats in Congress have opposed his previous budgets. We hope that changes. We probably need to have a national election before it does, Vought said.
In 2000, he was finally elected to the U.S. House, where he served for 12 years, rising to the No. 3 Republican leadership position. And in 2012, he was elected governor of Indiana, succeeding the enormously popular Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels, known for balancing budgets and building a business-friendly environment.
LIASSON: If the Democrats' task for 2018 is to come up with a message to reach white, working-class voters, the Republicans' task, says Bolger, starts with governing.
GREENE: So this new policy goes into effect tomorrow and will remain in place through the 25 of March.
The House Budget Committee has approved legislation advancing President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, setting a path for intense debate in the Senate.
The benefits are heavily weighted towards low- and moderate-income families, in marked contrast to the 2017 tax cut, which Republicans championed on a similar, party-line basis.
I am so delighted to be here with my friend and a great leader, Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
But then, anyone who reads those stories knows that establishment has also become shorthand (well, technically, longhand) for moderate, not to mention for people who have spent long years in Washington — or who have connections to it.
As Elizabeth — as Elizabeth made clear, Donald Trump proves every day he is not in it for the American people. He's in it only for himself. And Elizabeth reminds us of that every chance she gets because ...
Meanwhile, those high-skill jobs are only going to keep growing, potentially faster than the number of people qualified to perform them, as Georgetown's CEW projects. If that's true, finding a way to better help people pay for college could be an essential part of any jobs plan.
We're going to speak now with a conservative kingmaker in a state that helped make Donald Trump his party's presumptive nominee. Businessman and GOP donor Art Pope has been credited with flipping North Carolina's legislature Republican in 2010 for the first time in more than a hundred years. Pope was a supporter of Marco Rubio and has said he will not donate to the Trump campaign. Welcome to the program.
It stressed unity, and set a tone of decency, but there was a glaring, yet invisible sign of just how difficult true unity will be.
KEITH: Yeah, and it's a lot less. They're talking about $600 billion, which is about a third - less than a third of what Biden had been asking for. We're expecting more details today. But in the letter that the group sent to Biden yesterday, they did say that they agreed with him on funding more for vaccines, for COVID testing and PPE, about $160 billion. That's what his plan calls for as well. But beside that, it's much slimmed down. Their plan does have direct payments, but much smaller and more targeted, and also less money for schools reopening. And we don't know at all about the $350 billion that Biden's plan called for state and local aid. Unclear whether the Republicans are putting any toward that.
NPR's Will Huntsberry reports there is a sit-in going on outside the arena:
But you know what, if you want to, if you want to get out a message and if you want to go through Big tech, social media, they are really, if you're a conservative, if you're a Republican, if you have a big voice, I guess they call it shadow banned, right? Shadow banned. They shadow ban you, and it should be illegal.
LYNN LOPUCKI: The Trump casinos have renegotiated debt through bankruptcy four times. In a negotiation, both sides have to agree, so what undoubtedly happened was to the benefit of both the creditors and the Trump casinos.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a member of the House Financial Services Committee, weighed in on the GameStop phenomenon. Gotta admit it's really something to see Wall Streeters with a long history of treating our economy as a casino complain about a message board of posters also treating the market as a casino, the lawmaker tweeted Thursday.
Axelrod said that while Clinton only fed the public perception she was hiding something — exacerbated by the ongoing controversy over her private email server at the State Department — she's being held to a tougher standard by the media than her GOP rival Donald Trump.
WARREN: Yeah, I agree. And I think that it's even bigger than the guilty plea that Mike Flynn agreed to. This is somebody who was at every step of the way with Trump in the campaign, in the transition and then for 25 days in the White House. That's a big - a wide berth of information that Mike Flynn may have. I think we're so focused on what happened at the end of December 2016 and the transition and whether or not - and what Mike Flynn lied about to the FBI - that we're - that we can sort of forget that there's a lot of other things that he could be telling and talking to Mueller about and continuing to talk to Mueller about. And this is implicating not just the campaign, the transition but also figures in the White House, as well.

The idea behind this kind of levy is not new. It's had all sorts of iterations over the years: a financial transactions tax, a speculation tax, a Tobin tax, and — years before the stock trading app was founded — a Robin Hood tax. A core idea behind all of these taxes has been to raise the cost of trading in order to discourage investors from making frivolous bets, and to encourage them to invest only if they believe companies will be profitable over the long run. But rather than rising, the cost of trading has gone in the opposite direction in recent decades. Today, for both Wall Street investors with supercomputers and small-time investors with apps, it costs almost nothing to trade.
Those who are still driving are spending a lot of time and money cleaning their cars.

The suicidality of this particular population is much higher, she notes. The chances that they will leave the church are much higher. These [realities] weigh very heavily on me.
However, Putin got the impression that McFaul was running a counter-revolution against him, and he has evidently believed it for years. McFaul told NPR's Terry Gross about two occasions on which he and just one other American went in for a meeting with Putin in Moscow — once with then-Secretary of State John Kerry and another with then-national security adviser Tom Donilon.
DAVIES: ...There's a process. What does that mean?
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., jump-started specifics for a comprehensive new plan, proposing a $750 billion to raise funding for unemployment insurance, coronavirus treatment and emergency child care assistance. The plan also includes student loan and housing payment assistance, aid to small businesses and expansion of hospital and treatment capacity.
In South Carolina, whoever wins the GOP nomination in the 5th Congressional District will be a near-lock to succeed White House Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney.
My opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve American children. And that's what she's doing. And that's what's she's done. We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.
Today we see a very important event though. Because right over there, right there, we see the event going to take place. And I'm going to be watching. Because history is going to be made. We're going to see whether or not we have great and courageous leaders, or whether or not we have leaders that should be ashamed of themselves throughout history, throughout eternity they'll be ashamed.
All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened radical-left Democrats, which is what they're doing. And stolen by the fake news media. That's what they've done and what they're doing. We will never give up, we will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved.
President Trump proposed $4.4 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade in his budget for fiscal year 2021 — a document that is expected to be quickly dismissed by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.
SCHNEIDER: This mall, called The Fountains at Farah, is not far from the Walmart where the shooting took place. Lisa Vasquez out school shopping with her son is thinking about that but isn't overly concerned.

It was unclear how the president directed the grant specifically to the student. He urged Congress to pass a bill providing tax credits to those contributing to elementary and secondary school scholarship programs.
Perhaps of more interest to candidates, 75% of all voters this year say they would be more likely to vote for someone who has a plan to make housing more affordable, which may explain why candidates are lining up to offer plans.

JOEL PRAKKEN: And then what about disruptions because public transportation is delayed, courts are closed, inspections are not being done, all of that?
This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Now that Donald Trump is starting to put together his administration, Americans are wondering which of his provocative campaign proposals will he seriously pursue and which ones might he abandon or compromise on, how much of his agenda can he accomplish on his own without congressional action, and how quickly will he be able to have an impact in key policy areas?
LEFRAK: Both Democratic and Republican politicians have supported this loophole. Rubenstein bills himself as completely nonpartisan. He's a registered independent voter, and he doesn't donate a cent to political campaigns. He has relationships with every living president. Smithsonian Secretary Lonnie Bunch says he relies on Rubenstein not just for donations, but for political advice.
So when Linton says that what she and her husband sacrifice per year is a lot more than what a not-nearly-as-rich American sacrifices, this principle dictates that in many cases, she may be wrong, because that sacrifice is relative.
What's more, Republicans, who turned a blind eye to Trump's deficit spending and ballooning of the debt, are already becoming fiscal hawks once again.
For example, faster growth in Europe is boosting the euro. It now costs $1.19 to buy one euro, up from $1.03 late last year. That's a disappointment for U.S. tourists visiting eurozone countries, because their money won't go as far. But it's a boon for U.S. exporters whose products are more competitive.
That argument is unlikely to win over Republicans like Corker, who repeated this week that he views the deficit as the biggest threat to the nation.
And you had a governor and a legislature that, you know, in essence utterly disrespected that decision and that determination by that local community and preempted it.

It's been more than a year since Congress passed the big, federal education law known as the Every Student Succeeds Act or ESSA, and earlier this week, we got our first glimpse of how some states have responded to its most important requirements.
The memos and the decisions they reflected offered plenty of fodder for the ensuing news cycle, and touched off a flurry of sharp, wide-ranging questions, including: Why weren't employees reminded of the policy prior to previous events such as the ones Glenn Beck and Al Sharpton had held earlier that fall?
Facebook and Apple: Opposite ways of making money
Those individuals include Edward DeBartolo Jr., the former San Francisco 49ers owner convicted in a gambling fraud scandal; convicted Wall Street financier Michael Milken, who became known as the junk bond king; and Bernard Kerik, the former New York City police commissioner who pleaded guilty in 2009 to tax fraud and lying to federal officials.

PRAMILA JAYAPAL: The issue here is we made a promise to raise the minimum wage. We now have to deliver on that promise to 27 million Americans who are not going to be much convinced when we go back in two years and say sorry, the unelected parliamentarian told us we couldn't raise the minimum wage.
MARTIN: It's certainly early days. But, I mean, given what we're seeing, do you have any estimate as to how many people in the industry could ultimately end up unemployed?
The first county to fully roll out its process for restoring the voting rights of people with felony convictions was Miami-Dade. In a July press conference, the Miami-Dade State Attorney's Office, Public Defender's Office, Clerk of Courts and the 11th Judicial Circuit Courts jointly announced how the new process would be carried out.
To understand why interest rates are so low, it's helpful to think like central bankers. When they make their decisions, they have a theoretical interest rate in mind. In typical central banker fashion, it has a bunch of confusing names that make your eyes glaze over: the equilibrium real interest rate, the Wicksellian interest rate, r-star, or the natural rate of interest. Central bankers like Powell have been increasingly calling it the neutral rate, so we'll go with that.
The other thing that Susan Collins asked for was a reinsurance pool. That would help insurers pay for their sickest customers. Most analysts think that would help but that the money that's being talked about is probably not enough. Also, it's not entirely clear that they could get this through the House even if they can get it through the Senate.
The right shows no sign of letting go of attacking cancel culture on the left, either. It was even invoked by former Trump's lawyer in the impeachment trial on Tuesday.
COHN: I think that's a really big part of it. You know, I - by comparison, I compare the years leading up to the Affordable Care Act's enactment to the years leading up to the attempt to repeal. And when you look at how - why did Democrats get their legislation across the line? Well, a big reason was they spent 10, 15 years looking at where they had failed in the past and having these very complex, difficult debates internally about how to design a plan that would work, that could - they could sell politically, that they could get through Congress. So they were really ready. They'd done a ton of homework by the time, you know, 2009 comes around and they have the ability to actually pass legislation. You compare that to the Republicans. You know, in the period between 2010 and 2017, they had seven years really to do that, to sort of go through the same process, to really kind of say, all right, what does our replacement look like? How do we pass it? And, you know, health care is hard, right?

It's a challenge for a Trump presidency, says Jack Hoadley, a research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute. To get a true repeal and replace through, he needs 60 votes in the Senate. That's the minimum number of votes needed to overcome a filibuster in the Senate.

Carrion is more accepting of the statue — especially since it was bringing in tourists. But Puerto Rico's indigenous people, the Tainos, bitterly objected — citing Columbus's infamous treatment of Indians in Puerto Rico and throughout the Americas.
President Trump made the trip up Pennsylvania Avenue to close the deal with members of his own party on a bill that, on the face of it, does what Republicans have been promising to do for years: Repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
GINGRICH: Well, it probably creates a space for somebody like Beto O'Rourke to show up as a totally unknown person, with no record, who is cheerfully pleasant and can say, I didn't do any of it. I think this hurts all - you know, and not just the old-timers. I mean, I think this hurts the Kamala Harrises, and it hurts Booker. It hurts anybody who's in office right now because they don't have a solution, and they become part of the mess.
Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., and Richard Neal, D-Mass., the ranking Democrats on the Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means committee, issued a joint statement saying the bill would rip healthcare away from millions of Americans, ration care for working families and put insurance companies back in charge.
LEVINE: I think in terms of the split in the Democratic Party, that could be something that really plays out in primaries - how people get their money. You saw Bernie Sanders in 2016 really rally a small donor base, raise incredible amounts of money from people giving very small amounts - recurring monthly contributions.
ZARROLI: Gunnlaugsson soon walked out on the interview. And today, he was facing calls to resign. The documents have been released at a time when much attention is being focused on tax avoidance schemes.

Asked whether she'd make the minimum wage an ultimatum for her final support, Jayapal was careful to say her vote would be based on the bill as whole — not just that one aspect. If this package were to get significantly watered down by Senate Democrats, that would be a problem for progressives in the House.
In a tweet sent out Monday afternoon, Trump said he was surprised that Harley-Davidson of all companies, would be the first to wave the White Flag. I fought hard for them....

Seattle City Council To Decide Monday On Jobs Tax
President Trump is preparing to overhaul the nation's tax code, and at least some of the coming changes could benefit his own bottom line. Critics say voters should be able to see just how much help the president might get from a revised tax code, so they are stepping up efforts to force him to share his tax returns.
If governments tax products like sugary drinks, they can reduce suffering and save lives. They can also cut healthcare costs and increase revenues to invest in health services, Bettcher was quoted as saying in a WHO release on the report.
Prevailing winds are blowing in Biden's direction. Renewable energy is increasingly cheaper and, along with a glut of natural gas, is driving coal power plants to retire. States and companies are pursuing their own goals to cut emissions.

In fact, most corporations have access to pretty much all the money they need right now, says Josh Bivens, director of research at the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute. But they're not investing all that much or increasing wages.
The U.K. has also announced plans to merge its Department for International Development into its Foreign Office, a move that more than 100 charities say risks politicizing U.K. aid. These shifts by the U.S. and U.K., two of the world's largest aid donors, could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world, says Konyndyk. — Joanne Lu
POPE: I disagree with your comment, the organizations I, quote, have funded have supported the law. The whole matter of dealing with House Bill 2 and the Charlotte ordinance is unfortunate. Before the city of Charlotte passed its ordinance, we didn't have any laws describing how a bathroom's to be used.

Trump said in September that he was giving Congress six months to address DACA, the executive action implemented by Obama on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. That means Congress has until March to do something. DACA allowed people brought to the country as children to avoid deportation. Obama signed the executive order after Congress failed to pass a bipartisan comprehensive immigration overhaul.

LUCAS: So Parnas tried to play that down. He tried to distance himself from the other individual who was in those text messages. He says that that individual was not credible. He didn't believe himself. Parnas said that Yovanovitch was actually being monitored. But he said that he and Giuliani were, yes, working very hard to get Yovanovitch removed from her post as ambassador to Ukraine. Here's a clip of him being asked about why they wanted her out.

But in the early days here since Election Day, we've received some indications that he has been surprised. The Wall Street Journal reported from inside the meeting with President Obama they received reports that Donald Trump seemed to be taken aback by the scope of responsibility that he would have as president, the sheer range of responsibilities that he would have on a daily basis. So, you know, I think what historians will tell you is that the office of the presidency has a dramatic effect on people, and the simple act of getting into the office suddenly conveys to them the solemnity of that responsibility and having 310 million souls on their watch.

It was a tumultuous week in Washington with President Trump and House Republicans unable to agree on a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. So Obamacare remains, as Speaker Paul Ryan said, the law of the land. So how is that law playing out for people? Critics often point to Arizona as a state where the Affordable Care Act has not worked out well. Reporter Will Stone joins us from member station KJZZ in Tempe to talk about the ACA in Arizona.

Anyone who thought the North Korean leader would be cowed by a more saber-rattling U.S. stance was mistaken. Kim Jong Un took to state airwaves during the New Year's holiday weekend to tout that his country had made progress as a nuclear power — and that he has a button to launch attacks on his desk.
BARB BYRUM: At the end of the day, if people do not want to believe this fact, they're not going to believe it regardless of how many audits are performed, reports are issued or how transparent the process is.
Steve Bannon, in his career at Breitbart, really transformed that organization into the principal exponent of those three ideas. So what you see today is Donald Trump is trying to balance the strategic objectives that his campaign road to victory in the form of Steve Bannon with the practical necessity of how do you actually operate within Washington. And for that, Reince Priebus, the new chief of staff, is the ultimate Washington professional. He has been here for his professional life. He has really risen to the top ranks of the Republican establishment, and he's now in the position to be able to try to help Donald Trump achieve his objectives.
Republicans in the House, however, have identified one other potential source of funding. Our plan caps the open-ended tax break on employer-based premiums, said their proposal, called A Better Way.
Much of the criticism surrounding the U.S. refugee program these days surrounds the resettlement of Syrian refugees. As NPR's Brian Naylor reported in November 2015, it takes around 18 to 24 months for a refugee to go through the U.S. screening process. At that time, the U.S. had admitted 1,800 Syrian refugees over two years, half of whom were children.

In June 2019, Chennai, India, reached Day Zero — the day on which the city's reservoirs ran almost completely out of water. By the fall, seasonal rains had resupplied the city, at least temporarily. But the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020.
SNELL: Yeah. Lev Parnas was helping Rudy Giuliani, who is President Trump's attorney, dig up dirt. Parnas was indicted in October on campaign finance violations. And then federal investigators seized documents and electronics and records as part of that whole federal probe. Parnas was recently cleared by a court to provide these documents to Congress and so he did that. These new materials track kind of with the whole narrative that we already know - you know, that Parnas and Giuliani were working to get the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate Democrats.
CORLEY: State Representative Justin Slaughter says the death of George Floyd and others, along with the summer protests and marches over policing and racial and social justice, galvanized the Black Caucus. It was time, says Slaughter, for lawmakers to change a policy that's had a disproportionately negative impact on people of color, forcing many to remain in jail or, in some cases, accept plea deals as a way to get out. And in what Slaughter says was an emotional week, lawmakers narrowly approved a package of bills that included the Illinois Pretrial Fairness Act. It eliminates bail, and that's a step that activists across the country call key to criminal justice reform.

This theoretical rate, like the real-world interest rates it represents, is ultimately set by the markets for money coming together. On one side, is all our savings. Our bank accounts, pension funds and so on. That's the supply of money for the stuff (capital) that grows our economy. On the other side, is that stuff, aka investment: factories, houses, laboratories, rocket ships, office chairs. That's the demand for money. It's a gazillion buyers and sellers all coming together to agree on the price of borrowing money.
So let's talk about the future, and four big questions that we as a country have to answer – regardless of who the next President is, or who controls the next Congress.
Freshman rising star Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is bringing Ana Maria Archila, a community activist and sexual assault survivor who confronted then-Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., in an elevator over his support for then-Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
I've got this thing, and it's f****** golden, Blagojevich said in the wiretapped call. And I'm not just giving it up for f****** nothing.
And so that argument I think is unpersuasive. In fact, it's not this patchwork - they don't want those bills anywhere. They don't want to have a higher minimum wage. They don't want that higher minimum wage at the city or the state level. And so the patchwork argument is really, I think, a bit of a red herring, but that's argument that you hear.
But being able to pay into something that would reduce by even a third what I'm paying now — I'd love that, she says.

However, the smaller refunds have triggered shock and anger. Taxpayers faced with smaller refunds or higher taxes have been airing their grievances online with the hashtags #GOPTaxScam and #GOPTaxScamStories. Meanwhile, Donald Trump Jr. and others have pushed back, claiming the complainers are misinformed.
But the tests will be really helpful to really understand the dimensions of this epidemic. And they're finally starting to do sort of population-wide screening - public health departments are - to get a sense of, you know, is this sort of bubbling under the surface? There are like 5,000 reported tests - cases in this country. But pretty clearly, there's a lot, lot more than that.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump held no public events Monday, but he nonetheless called into several cable television shows in an effort to clarify statements from last week about how he might negotiate federal deficit payments. His earlier remarks had plenty of economists in an uproar.
More money for the opioid epidemic. The Senate's initial bill offered $2 billion to address the opioid crisis for 2018. This version would offer about $45 billion over 10 years, which is what Republicans Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman and West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito had requested at one point. However, some experts say that around $4.5 billion a year is nowhere near enough for combating America's massive opioid epidemic, as the New York Times reported in June.
But after that initial spike, growth slowed to a 3.4 percent pace in the third quarter and then continued to soften at the end of the year.
One of the most pernicious myths is that vaginas are in a constant state of near-catastrophe and need cleaning and repair, says Dr. Jen Gunter, New York Times columnist and author of The Vagina Bible: The Vulva And The Vagina — Separating The Myth From The Medicine.

DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Right.

And, you know, that's something that Senator McCain has already talked about in a book that he co-wrote with Mark Salter, who we just had on - had said that he doesn't care, you know, that he did this because the fact was he couldn't substantiate the allegations. And if you're looking for the truth, then you pass it on to the FBI. And anyone who didn't like it, he said, could go to hell.

The opposition populist hard-right League, which governs much of the North, has tried to exploit the virus crisis for its own political ends, and this has created a lot of conflicting directives from different authorities.

You know, I say, sometimes jokingly, but there's no joke about it: I've been in two elections. I won them both and the second one, I won much bigger than the first. OK. Almost 75 million people voted for our campaign, the most of any incumbent president by far in the history of our country, 12 million more people than four years ago.
SMITH: Absolutely. Well, the good news is that both parties are really talking about this. We saw it in the presidential election. We're seeing it now in the meeting that's taking place today. And all the rhetoric that you're hearing is actually very, very good. The conversation has changed. People are recognizing the problem. And I think the public is recognizing the problem. And polling is showing that, that this is one of the top issues that the public would like to see Congress address in 2019.

What I think that Ronald Reagan did was both in demeanor and in action say, come on in; there is room for everybody in our party. That's how they were able to get the so-called blue-collar Democrats, the Reagan Democrats to come to our side and elect him and re-elect him by overwhelming margins. I don't think that Ronald Reagan ever sent a message of exclusion.

TRUMP: He said Ronald Reagan and every president has wanted to get ANWR approved. And after that, I said, oh, make sure that's in the bill. It was amazing how that had an impact - that had a very big impact on me.
The days of somebody running a punch press or a drill press — those days are gone, said Koos. That's all automated. But the people that program that, and maintain that, and calibrate that, that's where the jobs are.

Democratic presidential hopefuls are converging on South Carolina, an important stop as they look to get their party's nomination. It's one of the first states to hold a primary. And even though it votes reliably Republican, it has a vital bloc of Democratic voters; African Americans.

Marchers took to the streets in more than 100 cities including New York, Los Angeles and Seattle. Meanwhile, Trump supporters staged their own, smaller Pittsburgh Not Paris event in D.C. to show support of President Trump's decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement.

The elections hinge in part on support for President Trump. In the race for Senate, candidates were running to replace Republican Senator Bob Corker, who will retire at the end of his term; the election has become competitive for Democrats, despite Trump winning almost every county in the state in 2016.

ELVING: That's why the Michael Cohen revelation this week seems to be so important. We've been talking about this for the better part of two years now. We've always been kind of dubious about whether or not there was an actual provable case of collusion, as opposed to obstruction. An active cooperation with the Russian interference would seem to be the collusion everyone's looking for. A lot of journalists and Democrats have thought it more likely that we would simply get an obstruction case, which might be easier to prove. But in the news of this week, we see a wider possibility.

But as long as we're not creating jobs, based on the natural resources we have, it's a waste.
For the moment, put aside questions of partisan bias (not that Trump intends to). Think instead about the degree to which Trump rejects key values fundamental to journalism, undergirding a deeply held worldview. Trump barely gives lip service to transparency. It's hard to foresee what kind of information the White House — or various federal agencies and departments — will give out under his watch.
Higher education: $39 billion in grants to higher education institutions. Public and private nonprofit institutions receiving relief will be required to spend at least half of the funds on emergency financial aid grants to students.

When you can say you're sticking it to The Man, you get to be the anti-Man, the little guy. The unspoken message is that there are rock 'n' roll things you'd like to do (single-payer health care, instituting a value-added tax) but that some stuffy group of squares is keeping you down.
SAGAL: It turns out - we were surprised, too.
This is the sixth statewide teacher protest since February. With the broad support of parents and other members of the public, teachers, through grassroots organizing, have notched some victories in a group of mostly Republican right-to-work states.
Democrats decided their top priority wasn't pandemic relief, he said. It was their Washington wish list. It was jamming through unrelated policy changes they couldn't pass honestly. A colossal missed opportunity for our nation.
GURIAN: Senator Lautenberg estimates his bill would generate up to $2 billion a year of much-needed revenue for the Superfund trust fund. He's working with the Senate Finance Committee to get it included with a package of energy taxes after Congress returns in mid-September from its summer recess.
That's because it doesn't create new tax incentives that specifically encourage companies to hire workers and create jobs, some employers and economists say. But it does expand incentives for companies to buy robots and machines that replace workers.
So could everyday Internet users get sued for sharing memes on social media? The possibilities worry Meredith Rose, policy counsel for the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge.
It's up to us to help remake that system. And that means we have to set priorities.
Have the Papers changed the way Africans view corruption?
The White House maintains that Biden is deeply committed to raising the minimum wage. We were disappointed that the parliamentarian ruled against included minimum wage, said Ruiz. What the president has said, and what we are all incredibly committed to, is finding other avenues and other lanes for accomplishing this goal of reaching an increase in the minimum wage.
MARTIN: Jay Inslee is the governor of Washington and the latest Democratic presidential contender to give us his opening argument.

ELVING: Well, you know, we just saw the national security adviser fired, and we have just had this extraordinary, phenomenal spectacle of watching the president say, you know, I had a secret meeting coming up at Camp David to settle that whole Afghanistan war thing, and now I called it off because one of our soldiers got killed. Clearly they were going to have to get around to talking a little bit about foreign policy tonight. And they did talk about Afghanistan. They did talk, of course, about Iraq.

Tapper went on to ask other candidates to weigh in on the same question on taxes. Sanders envisions that those taxes would be replacing other health spending. The broader question here is how much people would end up spending in total on health care.

In addition to the antibiotics for her pneumonia, Clinton takes three regular medications — Armour Thyroid, used to treat hypothyroidism and other thyroid disorders; Coumadin, which can prevent and treat blood clots; and Clarinex, an allergy medication — and vitamin B-12 as needed.

We want to put the brakes on globalization a little bit and reassert control over our country, our borders, our economic policy, our tax policy, with the recognition that the distinction of citizenship means something and citizens are in it together fundamentally in a way that the world community is not, Anton says.

Unlike a tax deduction, a tax credit reduces the tax bill dollar for dollar. And that's what makes it very powerful, Marr adds.
ELVING: As of this morning, the president seems to be at war with Congresswoman Wilson. He is going on Twitter, as you say, to call her wacky and saying he hopes that the fake media will continue to pay attention to her because he says that she's destroying the Democratic Party. So what should've been a moment of shared mourning and tribute to Sgt. Johnson this week and today has turned into another difficult and depressing episode. And this one has ensnared even the chief of staff, John Kelly, in ways that he surely did not wish.
The top House and Senate law enforcement officials announced Thursday that there would be a temporary closure of all tours of the Capitol. They also said the Capitol building and House and Senate office buildings would be limited to members, staff, press and official visitors starting at 5 p.m. on Thursday. The measures are in effect until April 1.
Unions don't want a repeat of previous bailouts. After Sept. 11, airlines got cash assistance but several airlines still filed for bankruptcy and were able to cut jobs, wages and pensions. After the great recession of 2007-2009, when passengers and profits returned, airlines pumped much of the extra cash into executive bonuses and buying back stock to boost shareholder value instead of building up their reserves for a rainy day.

COHN: So on Day 1, the Biden administration got to work undoing changes that the Trump administration had made to the Affordable Care Act. You know, the Republican effort at repeal failed, but the Trump administration was very good at finding small, technical ways of changing the law so that, for example, the financial assistance that people got buying insurance was lower. And this involves things like adjusting the formula for actuarial value. And just sort of saying that phrase I think puts people to sleep, but it's important. And there are, you know, a dozen or so of these changes that the Trump administration made.
America has been through big changes before – wars and depression, the influx of immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, and movements to expand civil rights. Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change, promising to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. And each time, we overcame those fears. We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the dogmas of the quiet past. Instead we thought anew, and acted anew. We made change work for us, always extending America's promise outward, to the next frontier, to more and more people. And because we did – because we saw opportunity where others saw only peril – we emerged stronger and better than before.

OCASIO-CORTEZ: I think that - well, I don't think trust is the right word for it. But I do think that when there's a wide spectrum of debate on an issue, that is where the public plays a role.

Corrections Departments in Arizona, California, Florida, New Mexico and New York all report receiving the cards for inmates who qualify CARES Act payments. The states have communicated the problem to the IRS, but it's unclear what steps the federal agency will take to fix it.
HORSLEY: That's right. He was really responsible for this standoff this afternoon. And Trump fancies himself a good negotiator. Part of the art of deal making, he would say, is knowing when to walk away. So yes, during the last two and a half weeks, he had a lot of meetings. He made a lot of phone calls trying to sell this bill.
The campaign strategy was audacious, too. Jeb! 2016, the official campaign committee, essentially outsourced its media operation to the supposedly independent superPAC. This was more responsibility than any other presidential superPAC had, either this cycle or in 2012, the first presidential election after federal courts sanctioned superPACs.

And the recently-strong economy is a particularly appropriate topic in South Carolina, which is tied with two other states for the lowest unemployment rate in the nation, at 2.3%. And two of the other three early states, New Hampshire and Iowa, are also among the 10 states with the lowest unemployment. That has made these early states a test for Democrats of their economic messages amid a good job market in particular.
Miller says increased household responsibilities have forced many working mothers -- and especially Black and Latinx mothers — to scale back on their hours or leave the workforce entirely during the pandemic, further widening economic and racial disparities.
On Tuesday, D.C. Attorney General Racine accused Pack of establishing the non-profit Public Media Lab for the sole purpose of self-enrichment, shielding $4.1 million in tax-protected funds over 12 years to Manifold, his for-profit film venture.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has argued that a blanket tariff fails to directly punish countries like China for dumping low-cost steel in the American market. Graham said Sunday that Trump would let China off the hook while punishing U.S. companies that sell goods abroad by inviting retaliatory tariffs from other global trading partners. The reason our steel industry has been decimated is because of China dumping, Graham said in an interview on CBS's Face the Nation. China produces more steel than the world consumes for several years in a row. China is your problem, Mr. President.

That will change the economy more than anything.

SNELL: Well, they're saying that, first things first, they need to vote on that House bill that passed last week that they had to do some corrections to.

After that, he wants to work on getting consensus among Republicans and with the White House on the bigger package before they move on, and then they're going to present it to the Democrats. He says they want to move as fast as possible. And he compared this moment to 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis when he was asked about it today in a press conference. And he says, these are the kinds of moments that Congress can overcome, and they can, you know, get past what divides them.

Trump attempted to assuage concerns that fears about the virus were spreading to the stock market, which has been battered in recent weeks. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 5.9%. The slide moved the market decline from a correction to a bear market, which traders usually define as a drop of 20% or more from a recent high point. It marks the first time since the 2008 financial crisis that the Dow dipped into bear market territory.

Many congressional Republicans see an opening politically to tag the package as corrupt or stuffed with pet projects. They think pointing out hundreds of millions of dollars on items they argue aren't directly related to the pandemic, such as improvements to the transit system in Northern California, or tax credits that wouldn't go into effect until next year, could cause Democrats in swing states or purple House districts heartburn heading into the 2022 midterm elections.
Then there are the usual suspects: excess of bureaucracy, one of the slowest civil justice processes in Europe, high levels of tax avoidance, high levels of corruption, a crippling economic division between North and South, and one of the lowest fertility rates in the world. All these things, including an underfunded public education, condition the country's growth.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome are also diseases caused by a coronavirus that caused deadly global outbreaks.
It wasn't terribly interested in making deals: In the old days, the political establishment — the 'bosses,' the big contributors, the party's leading politicians — generally decided the party nominee, wrote Richard Strout in the Christian Science Monitor in 1980. The new system favors a new kind of candidate — not one schooled in compromise, in party unity, in consensus seeking like Lyndon Johnson, but one who is independent, strongly committed, and perhaps an outsider type.
We can't make those judgments yet about exactly what it's going to take and how we're going to get there, he said on ABC's This Week. But we do not have a choice about this as a country. If we want an economy that's going to grow in the future, we have to bring those deficits down.
In fact, you know, one of the things that was really surprising to me when I first began looking at the American Legislative Exchange Council, which, you know, is involved in these fights, was that not only did they oppose increasing the minimum wage, they opposed even having a minimum wage. And we've certainly seen some of that rhetoric on a campaign trail in this primary season as well.
Several of her top staff picks signal her priorities — reducing segregation, building up neighborhoods, tackling police reform — and some department heads will be kept on from Emanuel's administration.
Similar to the earlier ruling in California, the judge also found that including the question would be unconstitutional because, at a time of increased immigration enforcement and anti-immigrant rhetoric, it hinders the government's ability to count every person living in the U.S. once a decade as the Constitution requires.
FOWLER: So Delta actually lost that tax break in 2015 after it came out against a bill that some people said would discriminate against same-sex couples in Georgia. The last straw was when Delta's CEO at the time suggested that Georgia needed to do more and raise its taxes to help fund transportation initiatives. Delta was doing OK financially at the time, so state lawmakers had zero hesitation pulling the plug on that tax break.
INSKEEP: Although this doesn't actually do any of those things. It just sets a framework for what ought to be done.
If you are a strict utilitarian on this and you only care about whether there is good produced on the ground from the gift, then it becomes very important to make sure that the benefit from the gift is a large and substantial one, says Robert Reich, associate professor of political science at Stanford University and co-director of the Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society.
PLUTA: Polls show once again the president could face a tight race in a state that's politically divided and emblematic of the challenges facing working-class Americans.

To figure out whether the minimum wage was related to suicide rates, Kaufman and his coauthors looked at both numbers, by state, for every month between 1990 to 2015. They ran the numbers through a mathematical model which showed, on average, that for every $1 increase in the minimum wage, the suicide rate lowered by somewhere from 3.5% to 6%. When they added unemployment rates into the model, they found that the effect of each $1 increase appeared to be greater when more people were out of work.

I think it's now patently undeniable that the inclusion of the citizenship question was completely illegitimate, Saenz said. The federal government should do the right thing and remove the citizenship question.
MONTANARO: No. I mean, first, we should say there are things that do benefit the middle class. The biggest thing - a doubling of the standard deduction, so most people, you know, wouldn't have to figure out all those pesky itemized deductions, most likely. And some people would see a reduction in their tax rate, but some will likely pay more because of the new structure.
But, rate cuts without that revenue, would mean a major increase in federal deficits, causing heartburn for the party's deficit hawks.

WARREN: It could be. It's also not as far reaching as it could've been. I think the margins for Republicans in the Senate and the problems that they have in their house conference mean that it's not as big as maybe Paul Ryan always dreamed it would be. It could be significant. And it could be in many ways very similar to what Obamacare was for Democrats and the way that legislation didn't go as far as the party wanted it to go but could have far-reaching consequences. It could also be problematic for the Republican Party as Obamacare was for the Democrats.
BEARDSLEY: You know, they were able to save a crown of thorns and Saint Louis' tunic, those are two big things they're naming. They've stacked what they've saved next door in the Hotel de Ville.

So we don't know the - you know, exactly what's (inaudible) right now.

INSKEEP: Yeah. The military detained the country's civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, and her top officials. She's a popular leader who has been through this before. Way back in the 1980s, her party won elections, but the military took over and detained her. She eventually received a Nobel Peace Prize and after many years of protest became a democratically elected leader again. But now the military has taken over again after the results of an election they did not like.
Tunisia was the starting place of the Arab Spring of 2011 and is considered the only relative democratic success story of the movement. Large protests that year forced the ouster of longtime dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali.

Do I relax? I have a high energy level, and so I get restless. And I read. And I try to hike and get some exercise in and that kind of stuff. And I, you know, work late and get up early, but that's not because I don't - haven't got the ability to enjoy myself. I always have this kind of a feeling deep down that I want to seize the moment and do whatever I can while I have the opportunity to do it.
It's not yet clear which, if any, of these requests will make it into a final stimulus bill. But given the significant effect the coronavirus pandemic is having on the U.S. economy, this likely won't be the last stimulus package lawmakers will consider.
But as New York joins Oregon in trying to solve the housing affordability issue, landlords say the laws will shrink the market of affordable housing.
Aid will become even more political
Protests have rocked Iraq over the past year and a half. The largest have been in Baghdad, but the southern city of Nasiriyah has also seen large demonstrations and a months-long sit-in. A forceful crackdown has dampened the protests, but anger continues to simmer and activists say growing poverty is one factor that keeps it going.
The most pronounced swing seen in the poll was among independents. Over the past four months, their approval of the president has dissipated. In February, 40 percent of independents said they approved of the job Trump was doing, with 51 percent disapproving. Four months later in June, just 31 percent say they approve of the president with 59 percent of independents disapproving — a 17-point net-negative drop.
GREENE: OK. So given that, I mean, he does this interview. And we should say what he said, you know, much - some of it we know is true, some of it are allegations coming from him. But he makes these blunt claims on MSNBC. What exactly is he saying here?
PLUTA: Whitmer says she's glad to serve as Trump's State of the Union bete noire. She expects she may be rewriting her response until the last minute.
Obamacare includes a tax on health insurance companies to help offset the costs of federal subsidies that help people buy policies on the ACA markets. It was in place from 2014 through 2016, but then Congress passed a moratorium on the levy for this year. Insurance companies are lobbying hard to ensure it doesn't return next year. Oliver Wyman's analysis shows that continuing that moratorium would cut premiums by about 3 percent next year.
Both the technology itself, and the way we choose to use the technology, makes it so that what ought to be a conversation is just a set of Post-it notes that are scattered.

And it would allow businesses to immediately deduct the costs of business investments from their taxable income, a practice called full expensing — likewise, for five years.
HORSLEY: That's right. And the administration seems to be trying to address Main Street here as well as Wall Street, although House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took a swipe at the president's proposals, saying they seem more targeted propping up the Dow Jones than helping the Jones family.
MARTIN: President Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu signed the, quote, phase one deal, during a White House ceremony yesterday. Both sides promise stronger protections against economic misbehavior, like currency manipulation and technology theft. China also said it would buy about $200 billion more of American goods over the next two years. President Trump told Americans the deal is momentous. How is China presenting the agreement to its people?
Thank you both so much for your time and for all the work you're doing.
TRUMP: The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots. As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.
BURKE: (As Anthony) You're not trying to document some received idea of life out there on the docks - the daily grind, huddled listening to the wireless.
Those measures include promoting tax-free health savings accounts that might help individuals save money to pay for health care costs and allowing people to deduct the cost of their premiums on their personal income tax returns. Trump has said he also wants to allow insurers to sell policies across state lines to boost competition.

Trump Plan Emphasizes Child Care Tax Breaks President-elect Donald Trump's website says working- and middle-class taxpayers would see the biggest tax cuts, in percentage terms, under his plan. A married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses would see a 35 percent cut.
Gohad pays a special tax on all of his transactions for the privilege of buying from farmers there.
The fact that individuals, rather than governments, could take these actions on their own is one of the features making this study so interesting. When I contacted Louail, he spoke of the possibility of developing apps that might give people different shopping options to rewire the economic health of different neighborhoods.
University of Pennsylvania researcher Jalil Mustaffa Bishop studies the experiences of student borrowers. He says, What we know from research is that those who borrowed student loan debt [did it] because they come from households or personal financial situations where they don't have the assets or the income to afford higher education.
A middle ground, proposed by many of the Democratic presidential candidates, might be a public option, a government-run health plan that individuals — or their employers — could pay to join if they didn't like their other options.

Specter was a moderate Republican senator who eventually became a Democrat. In contrast, Ham points to the Arizona GOP's recent decision to censure several of its most visible members, including conservative Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey.
MANN: Yeah. It's really hard. The streets are empty, shops empty. The cost of managing this outbreak is spiraling upward. I spoke with New Rochelle's mayor, Noam Bramson, yesterday. And he says as this drags on, it's getting harder and harder on people.
MANDEL: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And I don't think that the Trump administration is beyond pushing us to a constitutional crisis, and I am afraid that House Democrats are blowing all of their authority on a story that is just politicking. This is just Washington as usual.
But because of the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, he actually ended up paying $38 million.
INSKEEP: If I may, I think Pete Buttigieg is one of the candidates that you or others have described as sucking up to billionaires in different ways. But as we have noted, after doing very well in Iowa, Buttigieg seems to be getting a lot of attention from New Hampshire voters. What's wrong with his argument that, well, he's a young guy and people should give a new generation a chance?
The United States is only just starting to get periods — or, at least, acknowledging that products for that time of the month aren't optional for menstruating women.
KASICH: ...Look, I've been - yes. And I've been, you know, involved in military reform for long enough to know that it is not my job to draw up the battle plan. It's my job to get the military experts to draw up a couple scenarios for me where I would then choose. That's the way it works. And when people who run for president start trying to tell you what the troop level ought to be, you better find out what they know about stuff.
He said his next step will be pushing for permanent protection for the Arctic refuge. He's likely to have support from a Biden administration. The president-elect and his appointee to lead the Interior Department have both said they oppose drilling there, and Georgia's run-off elections give Democrats control of the Senate along with the House.
Opponents of the Johnson Amendment say such punishment is rarely seen because pastors are intimidated into silence.

Graduating with degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics (STEM) leads to better employment prospects. But my father's reminder that it would be best to study engineering fell on deaf years when I was 19 and fresh out of high school. I enrolled in the Humanities, as many other Italians before and after me.
Which is why I alone can fix it.

Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, has a competing plan for a monthly child benefit for families. His plan would increase the monthly payments for younger children to $350 and would include expecting parents. The maximum monthly payment would $1,250 per family and would start to phase out for single tax filers earning more than $200,000 and joint filers earning over $400,000.
But unlike some of her rivals, she's mainly stuck with a positive message so far and stayed out of the fray, seeking to position herself as a unifying candidate.
[A large body of academic research suggests that labor unions do raise the overall level of wages and benefits in the economy. An influential 2011 research paper found that declines in union membership since 1973 accounted for a third of the increase in wage inequality for male workers and a fifth of the increase in wage inequality for female workers. -Brett Neely]

The company would not offer its own estimate on the number of bots on its app, or any on-the-record rebuttal to the study's findings, besides the following statement: Anyone claiming that spam accounts on Twitter are distorting the national, political conversation is misinformed.
Talking to Latino audiences about immigration isn't pandering. We know that is an issue that matters to this electorate. It disproportionately affects this electorate. So, if candidates are talking about immigration, that's the right thing to do, says Manzano. She says that while clunky overtures like visiting taquerias or speaking in broken Spanish can appear cringeworthy, they don't all come from a bad place.
In a series of tweets on Saturday, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont called it the most significant piece of legislation to benefit working families in the modern history of this country.
He also called for an increase in military spending, including efforts to modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression.
Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed a bill Monday that makes Illinois the first state in the country to abolish cash bail payments for jail release for people who have been arrested and are waiting for their case to be heard.
In the end, thousands of prosecutions could stem from the Panama Papers, if only law enforcement could access and evaluate the actual documents, Doe said.
MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: In Virginia, the results were stunning. The liberal base was energized. The Democrats' 2008 coalition - educated suburbanites, millennials and single women - turned out in ways they hadn't for many cycles. But if the Democrats' goal is to take back the House and limit their losses in the Senate, they need to figure out whether they can replicate their Virginia win.
[A recent Pew poll found that just 9 percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning Sanders supporters said they planned to vote for Trump in the general election. 85% say they plan to vote for Clinton in the general election, compared with 9% who say they will vote for Trump and 6% who volunteer that they will vote for another candidate or don't know. [Sanders got approximately 12 million popular votes. Back-of-the-envelope calculation, 9 percent of 12 million is a bit more than 1 million, not millions. And that poll was taken before Sanders endorsed Clinton. — Tamara Keith]
In example, sort of a parallel situation is one we've written about a couple of weeks ago where this illegal campaign donation - the Donald J. Trump Foundation is prohibited from giving political gifts, but Trump used it to give a gift to Pam Bondi...
WARREN: Look - I'm talking about generally in this race. Take a look at it. But ultimately, we have one job, and that is to beat Donald Trump in November. And to do that, we're going to have to pull our party together. And I think I am the best person to do that because I'm trying to reach out to everyone. I've run a campaign that's open, that respects everyone.
You know what's interesting? President Obama beat Biden in every state other than the swing states where Biden killed them, but the swing states were the ones that mattered.
U.K. Lawmakers Want To Battle Waste With A 'Latte Levy' On Disposable Cups
The 135-bed hospital on Dorchester Avenue will be converted immediately to enhance 'patient isolation protocols' and to marshal equipment such as ventilators and personal protective equipment on site, member station WBUR reports.
Many progressive lawmakers and activists say they're largely pleased with the early weeks of Biden's presidency, and the open doors, phone lines and Zoom sessions they've been met with by the White House.
Here's a chart showing what this looks like. Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis illustrated the difference in growth between those high-, middle-, and low-skill jobs. That top line is professional jobs, which the folks at the bank label nonroutine cognitive — things that aren't rote repetition and require a fair amount of thinking and training (being a surgeon or an architect, for example).
Fossil fuel companies face an existential threat as more governments and businesses tackle climate change and vow to zero-out carbon emissions. President Biden has a plan to do that in the U.S., and some gas companies are recognizing they need a survival plan for the future.
And Brandwatch, another company that tracks social media trends, found that on Twitter, from the time Trump and Clinton formally began their campaigns for president, aside from conversation around the three presidential debates, only two policy-driven conversations were in their top 10 most-tweeted days. Those were Trump calling for a complete ban on Muslims entering the United States, and Trump visiting Mexico and delivering a fiery immigration speech in Arizona in the span of 24 hours. Brandwatch found that none of Clinton's 10 biggest days on Twitter centered on policy, save for the debates. (And even in that debate conversation, topics like nasty woman and bad hombres outpaced others.)
Other legal observers point out that's not how the lawmaking process works.
I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all Americans.
WARREN: Probably politically for them. I'm not so sure for the good of the country.

Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico more than three weeks ago, and residents of the territory have been frustrated with the federal government's response. Mainland politicians have also been urging the president to do more to help, such as New York Rep. Nydia Velazquez, who represents a large Puerto Rican constituency. She told NPR last month that the government's response has not been proportional to the extent of the disaster.
DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Evan Osnos. He is a staff writer for The New Yorker. A few weeks ago, he wrote a piece about what a Trump administration might look like, what powers it would have to act immediately on his policy initiatives. And we're consulting with him now to look ahead at what a Trump administration might look like.
While following social distancing guidelines may be important to mitigate the spread of the virus, it creates potentially grave economic challenges for American workers who are not easily able to telework or who do not have access to paid leave, the senators wrote. Further limitations on travel, access to more common general services, and cancellation of major events will potentially hurt a large number of Americans who work or depend upon hospitality, travel, tourism, and retail businesses.
If Michael Flynn had not lied about exactly what had gone on, I'm not sure he would have survived, but they just can't seem to talk straight about this. And so they create a strong sense that they're hiding something. And Trump contributes to that by blowing up every time that the Russia story comes up. He had actually maintained a Lenten fast on Twitter, and it just blew apart with this story.
SIMON: So someone selling 100 potholders a year on an online platform wouldn't have to pay it.
So how does that all fit into his talk about America first? But that is just the start. This is a man who plays coy with white supremacists and mocks people with disabilities, who talks about banning an entire religion from entering our country, who advocates getting rid of gun-free zones in schools, letting more countries have nuclear weapons, defaulting on our national debt, turning back the clock on marriage equality — and just like Elizabeth, I could go on and on.
With your help over the last four years, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country and nobody even challenges that.
I'm outraged at how slow the investigation of the Trump-Russian possible collusion has been going. And the fact that the GOP is completely complicit.
A source close to Clinton says she will be releasing her 2015 tax returns in the coming days (all of her tax returns dating back to the 1970s have been released to the public) and her running mate Tim Kaine will be releasing ten years of his family's tax returns as well. This is intended to put additional pressure on Trump, who has said he won't release his taxes while they are under audit, something he claims is ongoing.

MCCAIN: For a while. For a while, yeah. But mainly, what they wanted is what you can get out of torture. Mainly, what they wanted was to get war crimes, confessions, statements criticizing your country, those kinds of things. It all started, really, as a science back in the Bolshevik days when they would have the show trials where these people would literally condemn themselves to death in Soviet Russia and confess to crimes that they couldn't possibly have committed because they'd been tortured to the point where they'd do anything to relieve the pain. You see my point?

Hansen used the term secular not in the way normal people use it. He didn't mean nonreligious. He meant the third definition provided by Merriam-Webster: of or relating to a long term of indefinite duration. And so by secular stagnation, he meant a long-term period of crappy economic growth.
The study also needs more detailed data before it can rule out the potential impact of programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, which she says could possibly help protect against suicide.

BEARDSLEY: It's very somber. You know, I got up this morning, and I thought, Notre Dame has been ravaged. And it was a weird feeling knowing that. And I came down here, and I'm sitting on a bench beside the river. And I'm looking at the charred stone of a stained glass window. And there's no spire anymore. And there's hundreds of people out, Parisians and tourists, just standing here, solemnly taking pictures and looking at the damage.
MCCAIN: Well, I believe that the process should be that Roe v. Wade be overturned. That would not change very much because it would then return the issue to the states. That's when those like me who believe in the sanctity of the unborn begin then the great debate to convince the hearts and minds of people that abortion is wrong. That is - the whole battleground is to have a debate and discussion respecting the views of others but trying to convince people that it is wrong.
And some labor economists agree. Daron Acemoglu is an economist at MIT who researches automation and robots and their impact on the labor market. He says automation is often a good thing. It can increase productivity and be an important part of keeping the U.S. economy competitive.
Small to moderate doses of caffeine haven't had a huge effect on kids in Temple's research, but she's not enthusiastic about supplying children with energy drinks.

At the same time, Kehoe set off firebombs on his property, burning the corpse of his wife, whom he had murdered sometime before.

SMITH: It's because the bill has changed so many times throughout the process that once the American people see everything that's in it, the popularity will not be there. It - as what I've said all along, it's the wrong plan at the wrong time. If this bill was about direct payments to people and putting shots in the arms and vaccines, you would have strong bipartisan support across this Congress, across this country. But less than 9% of the entire spending in this bill actually goes to crushing the virus and helping distribute vaccines and putting shots in arms.

KEY QUESTIONS Would you say it on an NPR program? This is the key test for helping us sort through what's acceptable to say in public settings: In appearing on TV or other media including electronic Web-based forums, we should not express views we would not air in our roles as NPR journalists. We avoid participating in shows, forums, or other venues that encourage punditry and speculation rather than fact-based analysis.
There were also more than 42,000 double votes in Nevada. Over 150,000 people were hurt so badly by what took place. And 1,500 ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match Nevada residents who died in 2020 prior to November 3 election. More than 8,000 votes were cast by individuals who had no address and probably didn't live there.
SHAPIRO: All right. Well, this bill, even without the minimum wage hike, has a lot in it. And it's going to the Senate after the House vote. What is the timeline there?
It's happening ... again. We have a presidential primary field full of candidates who (with one exception) aren't Latinx, trying to demonstrate how down they are with Hispanic and Latinx voters. Sure, politicians have to reach out to voters from across the cultural and racial spectrum — it's part of the job. But if that outreach is all style and little substance, it can come across as what some people call Hispandering.
M: Well, I think that is true. I mean, I think that's not the main argument because frankly, there's a lot of other things that does discourage employers from hiring workers, because they know that they might have higher taxes.

What Gives: Singh had purchased her Aetna insurance plan through Hofstra, paying $1,107 for the fall term. Aetna markets the plan specifically for students. Under its terms, students can be on the hook for up to $7,350 of the costs of medical care during a year, according to plan documents. Singh's Northwell bill of around $3,413 reflects the plan's requirement that she pay for 20% of the costs of her hospital stay.
If it's organized crime, building operations made to look like [legal grows], in order to export out, I'm much more concerned, he says. Obviously this is what the feds are mostly concerned about.

So I don't think that there's any kind of moral obligation to do this.
Climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world. And that's why the third big question we have to answer is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there's a problem.
AHLUWALIA: If you see, the media has played a huge role on that. And, of course, the narrative of that has been coming out of the media. I think that's the reason why he has pushed the fake news out at the same time. And he tweets directly. And mind you, look at his actions. We all knew what we signed up for and who we voted. And he became elected president. Let's not forget that. American people...
Raising The Minimum Wage By $1 May Prevent Thousands Of Suicides, Study Shows
Trump called his proposed defense increase historic, and that it will send a message to the world in these dangerous times, of American strength, security and resolve.
Extra stabilization money, in part for high-risk customers. The original version of the BCRA provided $112 billion that would have allowed states to stabilize their markets or help high-risk customers in a wide variety of ways. In this version, that is bumped up to $182 billion. One function of this money is to mitigate some of the two-tier issues created by new, nonqualified plans. If an insurer offers a plan that meets the Obamacare criteria, that insurer would be eligible for money to help high-risk customers.
GROSS: In the book, you describe the ACA as a highly flawed, distressingly compromised, woefully incomplete attempt to establish a basic right that already exists in every other developed nation. It's also the most ambitious and significant piece of domestic legislation to pass in half a century. It's not nearly good enough, and yet so much better than what came before.
In fact, just one state legislature has changed how its primaries work in recent years, and Sanders fans wouldn't much care for it: Idaho went from an open system to a closed one.
The White House and Congress negotiated a two-year spending deal last year that sets overall spending numbers for 2020 and 2021, another factor that will curb Trump's ambitions.
As President, I'll stand up to China and anyone else who tries to take advantage of American workers and companies.
Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders spoke with NPR's Ari Shapiro. The transcript below has been edited for clarity.
POWELL: We do recognize that a rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection. It won't fix a broken supply chain. We get that. We don't think we have all the answers.
KELLY: Before we let you go, we've been talking about Donald Trump's tax plans for the nation. How about his own taxes? He says his tax rate is none of our business. Should it be?
It's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people.
MCCAIN: Well, I would've had concerns. Look; we had doubts on board the ship. I'll never forget one time I had - was assigned a target that came from - directly from the basement of the White House that had been bombed 37 times before. A hundred yards down the road was a bridge that was not on the target list that, clearly, the trucks were going over. We all remember watching, in the port of Hai Phong, the Russian ships come in, offload the missiles, the missiles trucked up, put into place, and then being fired at us. And we couldn't do anything to stop that from happening. It was - some of it was so insane, it was almost ludicrous. And so we could see, those of us who were in combat, how crazy the tactics were and how they really were not hurting the Vietnamese. The only time the North Vietnamese got hurt was the Christmas bombing of 1972 when we virtually paralyzed them with B-52 bombing.
The poll gave respondents four options — 39 percent said that only 11 percent of Americans pay zero or negative income tax, and 31 percent said that only 27 percent pay zero or negative income tax. Only 21 percent got it right — right now, around 45 percent pay no federal income tax.
In the days and months ahead, I'd like to see less predictive punditry and much more reporting. God knows, the press has much to be humble about. I'd like to see much more careful coverage of Trump's actual policies and the rules, regulations and laws that emerge. Now is the time to capture not just what Trump has to say, but what people are doing in his name.
RASCOE: Yeah, that reaction kind of said it all when he said that - did you just forget what you just said? And everybody's like, oh.
Biden said meeting a goal of small family gatherings will make this Independence Day truly special. It would not only mark our independence as a nation, but mark our independence from this virus, the president said.
News Brief: Trump Impeachment, Russian Government, U.S-China Trade
Now panel it is time for you to answer some questions about the week's news. Greg, The Wall Street Journal is reporting in a growing trend among users of the Apple Watch - these people, some of them are using what to operate their watches?
MARTIN: So President Trump is also expected to, in this address, talk about the threat from North Korea and the new sanctions that his administration has placed on the regime there. I mean, we have heard sanctions package after sanctions package. Is there anything left to sanction in North Korea?
ROB STEIN, BYLINE: NPR health correspondent Rob Stein joins us now to explain. Rob, the worst may be over a year into this. I feel like you are about to play a really, really mean practical joke on me.
Presidents generally try to deliver on campaign promises — and in many cases they succeed. So like them or not, voters should take these pledges seriously.
KENNEDY: There are really three buckets that the restaurant industry is looking at right now. One is just immediate access to cash, second is medium and long-term access to credit and then tax relief for the industry when we come back online. This is really the perfect storm for the restaurant industry.
The tone — given the usual sobriety and apolitical nature of the gathering of religious leaders, lawmakers and other dignitaries — was stunning, if not unsurprising given how Trump has long ignored the usual rules.
YOUNG: Executive orders, regulatory actions that were unconstitutional and, very frankly, that we had to do it because otherwise they could undo it. And it could have been done again by another president in the future. So I think that site is very productive. And you look at the stock market where it was before, where it is now. And general attitude, regardless of what you in the media may think, the general attitude in the public's arena think that this country is on the road back to greatness again.
So think of what they did. No longer is there signature verification. Oh, that's OK. We want voter ID by the way. But no longer is there a signature verification. Eleven days before the election they say we don't want it. You know why they don't want to? Because they want to cheat. That's the only reason.
FOWLER: You know, you're right, Ailsa. It's not about the money. It's about the national conversation surrounding gun control, Delta not wanting to be a part of that conversation but ultimately not having a choice. And it's also a part of the conversation about Georgia politics. Georgia is electing a new governor in November, and Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle is a candidate running for governor, so this has quickly become a campaign issue.
COLEMAN: Now, it's not just Pruitt. There have been similar complaints about other members of President Trump's Cabinet. And it's cost some of them their jobs. Can you tell us about that?
Lightfoot not only must learn now to navigate a new political landscape at City Hall, but she also immediately has to deal with the city's serious financial problems and the onset of summer gun violence.
But when it comes to these other issues like immigration and sort of what we might describe as sort of political culture issues, things like treatment of the press and also his dealings in foreign affairs, on those matters, that's, I think, where we should expect him to be more like the candidate Trump than like a traditional Republican president.
States like Nevada and Hawaii and Alaska and Texas are not doing very well, said Goldwein. States like California have a $25 billion surplus. Idaho has had the fastest revenue growth it's seen in years. So there really are big differences between the states.
That's why it's important that the SSA pays attention to long-haulers, Larson says. In his view, the SSA faces a fundamental question: What do we have to do to make sure that we're there for these individuals?
Many opponents of the stimulus did criticize its efficiency, pointing out that many of the infrastructure projects it promised weren't shovel ready. And that's true, as investigative journalist Michael Grabell told NPR's Fresh Air in 2012.
The House and Senate bills both change or eliminate more than a dozen taxes that were levied to help pay for the Affordable Care Act's insurance subsidies and to bolster Medicare and expand Medicaid. Republicans and other ACA critics have argued that the taxes are onerous for businesses and families.
The cancel culture attacks have also happened within the party, and have been aimed by moderates toward more conservative Republicans. Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger slammed Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz recently for the Donald Trump loyalist's attacks on House GOP conference chair Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who voted to impeach the former president.​

Currently, he says, the child tax credit is a $2,000 credit, and it's very simple for middle-class children and higher-income children. They just get $2,000 per year per child.
I cussed that frickin' wind for 50 years, retired farmer Gary Scheid told the Mercer County commissioners at a meeting last July. This is an opportunity to maybe cash in a little bit on that wind.

We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs way down.
And we are going to fight climate change by making America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.
Here's what each state has done so far, by region:
One place where Trump is losing GOP support is over his Twitter habit. Sixty-nine percent of Americans say Trump's use of Twitter is reckless and distracting, while only 21 percent say it's effective and informative. Even among Republicans, only a narrow plurality (43 percent) say the president's use of Twitter is positive, while 42 percent agree it's reckless and distracting.
We're not turning @McFaul or any other American public servant over to Russia to be prosecuted for non-existent crimes. The White House should make that clear immediately, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee wrote on Twitter. Similar sentiments were expressed by Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., former Florida GOP Gov. Jeb Bush, and former Obama U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power.
The success of the term is, in part, a response to a desire to explain our politics in terms of conspiracy, he wrote.
We need to write a new chapter in the American dream — and it sure cannot be Chapter 11.
In a speech to farmers in Georgia this month, the President talked about his push to increase rural broadband and promoted the recent tax cuts that he says will spur investment in rural America.

BEARDSLEY: You know, every week, it's been a different thing. They wax and wane depending on the mood of the country that week. And yeah, the country's divided. I mean, half the country thinks these people are a nuisance, and they need to go away. But they don't go away, Scott. And it's like a little, small dog yipping at Macron's heel - actually, not so small sometimes. He can't really proceed with anything else until he solves this crisis. And it will not go away. And I think probably half the country doesn't like them. But they still have public support because I think a lot of people do see there's inequalities. And people can't, you know, really make ends meet. And - so it's a very mixed bag. I keep waiting for the poll that will say, you know, 80% of the French want the yellow vests to go home. But it doesn't come.
So I'm proposing a new tax credit to encourage more companies to share profits with workers.
The roots are that the structure of the economy has been wonky for decades, he says. Iraq depends on oil for as much as 98% of its revenue, he explains, almost all of which goes to the state. It basically means that the state has grown larger than it needs to be, that the private sector hasn't grown as large as it should be, and that the government is relied upon for creating jobs.
The oil industry says it's already reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the electricity sector as coal plants switch to natural gas.
SAGAL: Bill, how did Mo do on our quiz?
DETROW: ...In terms of this widespread spending, we have this interesting situation now where a lot of Republicans are making criticisms, and Democrats aren't saying that those criticisms are wrong; they're saying, yes, we're happy about that. I mean, just for example, the child tax credit, you have progressives like Bernie Sanders, the Biden administration, saying this certainly isn't targeted to COVID specific, but so many families are suffering because of this economic situation and the uncertainty that this makes sense. Why is something like that, for example - or more broadly - why is that broad approach wrong in a moment like this of such uncertainty, with health and the economy and everything else?
OCASIO-CORTEZ: Because I think we do. And if we want the United States to continue to be a global leader then that means we have to lead on the solution of this issue. And I think that it is completely wrong to point fingers at other developing nations and to say, well, China's doing this and India's doing that and Russia is doing this, when we can just choose to lead and we don't have to hold ourselves to a lower bar.
HORSLEY: Trump acknowledged that he built his casino empire with a lot of borrowed money, and he cheerfully referred to himself as the king of debt.

He first spoke to me about his desire to join a litigation team in his first year and I joked that he might want to find out where his locker is before he joined a litigation team, Turley told NPR.
LIASSON: Yes, presumably any company that produces something in Mexico and sends it to the U.S. would be subject to this tax, and they presumably would pass the cost of that onto the consumer. So yes, they - the consumers would probably bear the brunt of this tax. That is why so many interests in the United States' retailers, agriculture, oil refiners don't like this. And many Republican senators have a lot of questions about it. This is very preliminary. The White House is emphasizing that nothing is settled. This is one idea they're looking at.
REP. REID RIBBLE: I think the rest of this fall, the remainder of the fall is going to be centered around issues of the budget and how the conference committee is doing. Maybe there'll be some other lighter legislative initiatives that take place, but I'm a little bit skeptical. And then, if immigration reform is not done by the end of this year, it is highly unlikely that it would be done next year because it's an election year.
Otherwise, Birol says, carbon dioxide emissions — which have dropped off amid the pandemic — will rebound when economies recover.
That looked like it might have been a mistake as legislation bogged down at various points — especially when it appeared to have been nearly derailed by the special election of Republican Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts in January, costing Democrats their 60-vote, filibuster-proof majority in the Senate.
A week in which a political dispute may have overshadowed the memory of a soldier who gave his life. President Trump got into an ugly public battle over what he did or didn't say to the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, who died on duty in Niger. This morning on Twitter, the president said the Florida congresswoman who criticized him was quote, wacky. Former President George W. Bush gave a speech that seemed a direct rebuke of President Trump's leadership. And the Senate passed a budget blueprint, possibly a first step to a tax overhaul.

But it appears most likely, particularly in the case of the employer requirement, the administration probably does have the authority. And even if it doesn't, it's not clear who would be able to show enough harm to go to court to stop it.
But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America's soul, and the steel in America's spine. Each test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are, and show us what we can be, the president continued.

Overall, it's probably a good idea to pause energy drink sales to children, says Jennifer Temple, a nutrition researcher at the University of Buffalo who has studied how caffeine affects kids. We've seen kind of an explosion of energy drinks on the market over the past decade and a half, without really a whole lot of empirical data to understand what consuming these high amounts of caffeine can do, especially to children and adolescents, she says.

Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that no people on earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans. If there is a mountain, we climb it. If there's a frontier, we cross it. If there's a challenge, we tame it. If there is an opportunity, we seize it, Trump said. So let's begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our union is strong because our people are strong. And together, we are building a safe, strong and proud America.

Republicans have already told Biden they won't go that big, but in an effort to seek bipartisanship, Biden had a group of 10 Republicans to the White House Monday. Ten is an important number, because it's exactly the number of Republicans that Democrats would need to end a filibuster and pass the legislation.
But she says it's clearly a big challenge for the IRS to carry out all that has been put on its plate with the new legislation, and it's going to take some time for the agency to come with procedures to carry it out.

In the cheers after the second, a shooting safety officer in a lime green shirt and red hat said: Can you hear us now, Hillary?
Mottice is the kind of voter that Democrats count on in Ohio and that Clinton needs if she is to carry the state.

And Trump said today that they agreed mutually to cancel the meeting, and when he spoke to Republican lawmakers in Philadelphia as you just heard Scott talking about, he said unless Mexico treats the U.S. fairly and with respect, the meeting would be fruitless. So I guess the definition of treating U.S. - the U.S. fairly is paying for a wall on the U.S. side of the border, which Mexico says it will never do. And Trump in essence portrayed the U.S. as the victim of its poorer, smaller, less-powerful neighbor to the south.

He was happy to see that I got out of the woods, Borders says. He spent his whole life working in the woods, and there's not much for retirement.
We need not to discourage them, she says. They have an energy and will to innovation that is not only infectious, but inspiring.
Meanwhile, the U.S. faces an equally difficult question: How to provide decent jobs for workers who once would have been employed in manufacturing?
That announcement has not satisfied Trump and other Republicans, who are now calling — on a near-daily basis — for the Clintons to shut the entire foundation down.
Many Republicans at Wednesday's hearing used their allotted time to probe Cohen's motives for shifting his loyalty away from Trump after years of dedicated service — and the financial gain Cohen could potentially reap from telling his story.
Ways and Means Committee member Bill Pascrell spoke at the hearing to insist that Democrats have a right and a responsibility to provide direct oversight of any president. He maintained that part of that oversight is releasing tax returns that show whether the president is in compliance with tax laws.
America is already great, President Obama said. America is already strong. And I promise you, our strength, our greatness does not depend on Donald Trump.
That is not tax relief for working parents, Rubio said in a statement. It is welfare assistance.
Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, is also expected to send a letter to the president this week asking him to reconsider his position. Hatch opposes new tariffs because he believes they will undermine any economic boost delivered by the GOP's tax cuts. Should the administration opt to move forward with tariffs on steel and aluminum, American manufacturers, businesses, and consumers would be forced to bear the brunt paying more for steel and steel products. Such action could very well undercut the benefits of the pro-growth tax reform we fought to get on the books, Hatch said in a weekend statement.
Lebanon's worsening economic crisis has had dire consequences for the country's medical care. Doctors have staged sit-ins at hospitals to warn of shortages of lifesaving medicines and supplies, which can no longer be obtained from international suppliers due to a shortage of U.S. dollars.
SANDERS: Good. Well, that's a good question. And what you can do is use the carrot and the stick of the federal government. You're quite right. A lot of these decisions are being made at the local and the state level. But what we want certainly with federal law enforcement - our federal prisons - is we want it to be a model in order to have an impact on state and local government. And we also want to use federal funding to help move local police departments in a more positive direction.
Trump had picked Mulvaney as his acting chief of staff on December 14, 2018, after his first choice to replace John Kelly backed out of the job. Unlike Kelly, a former Marine general, Mulvaney took a more hands-off approach in managing the White House and the various competing factions within it.
Those sentiments are ones Flake has expressed before, particularly in his book Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle.

The answer from the airlines is not long: a couple of months or maybe even just weeks before the industry is crippled and tens of thousands of workers may be laid off or furloughed. The industry is being crushed by a huge drop in travel. Airports and airplanes are nearly empty, with some flights carrying fewer than a dozen passengers and many others canceled because hardly anyone is flying. The TSA only screened about 331,000 people nationwide Monday, compared to more than 2.4 million on the same day last year, a drop of 86 percent.
HORSLEY: The big thing in this bill is what Corker likes - that's a deep cut in the corporate tax rate. It comes all the way down from 35 percent to 21 percent. Both the House and Senate had initially wanted a 20 percent corporate tax rate, but negotiators nudged that up just a little bit to free up money for other things, including that cut in the top tax rate for wealthy people.
Above all, Bush seemed to be the victim of a Republican Party that may be fundamentally changed from the one that elected his father and brother president. But Wareham still felt, maybe wished, the campaign could have done something, anything to change the dynamic.
SCHRAGER: Stay safe. Protect vulnerable people - the elderly, people with medical conditions. Wash your hands.

You know, we're happy to do it as health care workers. We're happy to help you. But please support us and our families by listening to us.
Goldwater's candidacy was sort of the beginning of the end for the Eastern establishment, said Marty Cohen, co-author of The Party Decides, a 2008 book that argues that political insiders still play a huge part in selecting a party nominee.

POPE: That is correct. What I have actually recommended is that we just take one big step back and study the matter in a calm, reasonable manner. So Charlotte were to send its ordinance that started this and then the general assembly would either repeal or modify or put a moratorium on its law and have a commission come up with a workable statute.
That doesn't necessarily mean Washington could influence events in Russia in the same way Moscow has in the United States. Russia has no free press or open Internet in the way the West does, for example. So if the CIA stole information about Putin and tried to release it inside Russia — in the way Russian cyberspies allegedly did about American targets in 2016 — the Russian government could likely exercise much tighter control over it spreading.
On Tuesday, the Supreme Court threw out the suit entirely and went much further, cutting the heart out of much of the court's 1971 decision.
Not only have they lost millions of jobs due to growing trade deficits, said economist Robert Scott of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. But there has been downward pressure on the wages of a much, much larger number of Americans: nearly two-thirds of the labor force.

ROBERTS: Anybody who did that would be doing it for the purpose of saying we just can't stomach Donald Trump. And we're giving people an opportunity to vote for neither him nor Hillary Clinton, knowing that Hillary Clinton would then win. So the Democrats are dying for it to happen. But I think the likelihood is slim to none.

Sendhil Mullainathan is a behavioral economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, and he outlined early evidence for this theory in Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much, co-authored with Princeton psychologist Eldar Shafir. Poverty, they find, is like a parasite, consuming mental energy that could be put to more beneficial use. Put simply, being poor is like having just pulled an all-nighter, Mullainathan once told NPR. And that, he says, hurts their ability to escape poverty.

ROBERTS: Well, his - he points to polls that show that - that he is running ahead of Clinton against Trump. The reason, however, that he doesn't bring it up is that nobody has done any negative campaigning against him. There have been no negative ads against Bernie Sanders. Nobody has gone back and looked at his somewhat colorful past. And no one has really examined his policies in-depth.
HORSLEY: Yes. He had the job in Obama's administration that Kevin Hassett has now, and actually, there was a poignant moment yesterday, as Mr. Hassett was briefing a bunch of reporters about their forecast. We were sitting in the conference room with the Council of Economic Advisers, and there's photos of all the past chairmen hanging on the wall - Alan Krueger's, along with all of his predecessors - and it was a poignant moment.
PALMIERI: Single-payer is not my preference, but I do think that the Democrats in the House are going to have to come together to figure out which proposal they think is best and put that forward.

And that is going to be a place where they can make an enormous difference and they can do that right away.
Eighty-three percent of people who bought a plan during the open-enrollment period for 2018 qualified for premium tax credits. The average monthly premium per subsidized enrollee was $639; after accounting for premium tax credits, however, enrollees owed just $89 on average. That amount was 16 percent lower than the monthly premium the year before.

TOTENBERG: Well, she said a number of things. The first interview she gave, she said she couldn't imagine - she didn't even want to think what the country would be like with Donald Trump as president. That raised a few eyebrows. Then she gave two more interviews where she expanded on that and finally said in an interview with CNN online that Trump was a faker, who said totally inconsistent things and that the press was letting him get away with not releasing his press - his tax returns when every other candidate does that.
And the state legislature, which is, you know, dominated by Republicans and ALEC members, the members of American Legislative Exchange Council, have basically come forward and said if a city passes such a measure, the state will basically hold back funds for firefighters, for police. And so it will basically not do the revenue sharing that is traditional in Arizona between the state and the cities for providing funding for emergency services if a city dares to adopt a paid sick measure. And that basically stopped that measure in its tracks.
The other important issue is all the cancellations of travel and now conventions that we're seeing. That's going to have ripple effects on communities that are really big - like Orlando, Las Vegas - that have these conventions where large people gather. Of course, we're seeing in other countries even sports stadiums are being closed down so that they don't spread the infection. You can't regain that sale later on. So rate cuts alone can't hit either side of this equation, what's going on in production plans or what's happening with consumer behavior. But once - if we can bridge this - once we get to the other side, those lower rates will help us get out of the hole that we've dug by having this stop in economic activity.
When casinos are giving money to one of those groups right before an election that the casino has a vested interest in — like the governor's race — and then the DGA or RGA spends the money in that race, says Paul Seamus Ryan, an executive at the campaign finance watchdog Common Cause.

SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Noel.
Congressional Republicans appear to be on track to pass their $1.5 trillion tax cut. They would like it to be on the president's desk by Christmas Day. House and Senate negotiators released a final draft of the bill late yesterday, and two senators who had been undecided or even opposed announced their support. And that removes a potential roadblock in time for a vote next week. NPR's Scott Horsley joins us. Scott, thanks for being with us.
FURMAN: I think that is part of the story. Last week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that for private sector workers, wages were up 2.9 percent for the year. The market appeared to have taken that quite seriously. I'm a little bit less certain because they reported some other wage data that showed slower growth than that. But looking at the totality of recent releases, it does seem that wage growth probably has firmed somewhat - maybe not as much as that headline indicator would lead one to think.
Yesterday some observers said that we pulled off one of the biggest political upsets in the history of American politics. So stay tuned.

I think we have the momentum. We're looking forward to a victory.

Additionally, Biden is expected to increase the number of vaccinators, broadening the pool of those qualified to give shots to include dentists, paramedics, veterinarians, medical students and others.
HORSLEY: Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says that's especially true for upper-income workers, who've generally managed to keep working and who pay the lion's share of state taxes. Goldwein admits, though, there's a lot of variation around the country, and it doesn't break neatly along party lines. Tourism and oil prices both took a beating during the pandemic, so states that rely heavily on those industries suffered a much bigger blow.

He convinced other people that his Atlantic City properties were a great investment, so they would put in their own hard-earned money. But he always rigged it so he got paid, no matter how his companies performed. When this casino collapsed because of how badly he managed it, hundreds of people lost their jobs; shareholders were wiped out; lenders lost money; contractors — many of them small businesses — took heavy losses. And many themselves went bust.
Newsom also signed an executive order directing agencies to locate public properties near state roads and highways that can be used for short-term emergency shelters. The order additionally calls for using 100 camping trailers for temporary housing and the development of a multiagency strike team to help get people off the streets.
In the Rose Garden on Thursday, Trump said the rule threatens the tax-exempt status of a church if a leader speaks about issues of public or political importance. That is false: The amendment applies only to advocating for or against a specific candidate. Taking positions on issues is permitted.

So the politics of that are unclear. But the bottom line is America's roads and bridges are crumbling, and nothing is happening about it in Washington.

JUSTIN CHANG, BYLINE: The English filmmaker Joanna Hogg is not as well-known in this country as she should be.

But her new film, The Souvenir, represents a decisive breakthrough. This is her first picture drawn directly from her own experience. And while it's as dramatically restrained as her earlier work, it also has a startling emotional directness. It's a personal memoir that opens up into a piercing and beautifully acted love story.
James Klein, president of the American Benefits Council, which represents large employers, said they would look on such a proposal as potentially more damaging to the future of employer-provided insurance than the so-called Cadillac Tax, which his group has lobbied hard against.
And there is a pool of former ERS and NIFA staffers in Washington who refused to move, often because they had family connections and spouses with good jobs in the area. Many of the former USDA researchers simply took jobs with other agencies or even other departments within USDA.
Trump, GOP At Odds Over 'Border Adjustment' Tax
But in 2018, the Providence chef and restaurateur spent almost double his personal income on health insurance for his employees: $54,000 to cover a dozen or so people, compared with the $35,000 he paid himself as a salary.
The company did not say where production would be shifted, or how many jobs might be affected, but said the move would take nine to 18 months to complete.
WU: Exactly and also finding that he had lied during his cooperation agreement as the prosecutors had implied. You know, those situations are kind of deck is stacked against the defendants because it's the prosecutor's word for the most part, but she has made that finding against him. And actually there he - in a odd sense, he's lucky he faces a statutory cap of 10 years. The guidelines that she has available actually go beyond that but at worst they're 10 years. A lot of speculation on will she go concurrent or consecutive.
Support for low-income families: $4.5 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to help families with home heating and cooling costs. One provision would give the secretary of agriculture the authority and funding to temporarily boost the value of cash vouchers for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) up to $35 per month for women and children for a four-month period during the pandemic.

Every former president has set up some sort of foundation and aggressively raised money to fund it. Only one former president — Bill Clinton — has been married to someone eyeing her own run for the White House.

Most people in the U.S. who are being held in jail have not been convicted of a crime. Instead, they are awaiting trial. For some, that wait can take weeks or even years if they can't afford to pay a cash bail to be released. That practice is controversial. While a few states have taken steps to change their cash bail system, Illinois will become the first to ditch it entirely. NPR's Cheryl Corley reports.
MARTIN: That was the president yesterday speaking in Ohio, airing his grievances with John McCain again. The Arizona senator died seven months ago. Few elected Republicans are willing to criticize President Trump directly about these remarks. But Georgia Senator Johnny Isakson told Georgia Public Broadcasting President Trump has crossed a line.
BENSON: Well, I think that there were Republicans on the dais asking questions about Russian meddling. It is a bipartisan consensus that the Russian government at the highest levels, as Comey said, tried to interfere in our election. And that's unacceptable to all Americans across the political spectrum. I don't think that Republicans are saying that doesn't matter or it's a fairy tale. They concede it. I think that they are questioning how much was Trump involved, is there any evidence of collusion, and is some of this hysteria around the White House vis-a-vis Russia overblown and unfair?
Used to take 20 years to get a highway approved, now we're down to two. I want to get it down to one, but we're down to two. And it may get rejected for environmental or safety reasons, but we got it down to safety.
Overall, Madden pointed out, We're talking about a legislative agenda that, if you include tax reform, immigration, infrastructure and other priorities, would ordinarily consume two full terms. Passing this first test with health care reform will be an important gauge for the prospects of that larger agenda.
As for Trump, he said, anyone who has ever believed his promises has been hurt.

Instead, the bill entices people to voluntarily buy a policy by offering them tax credits based on age and income to help pay premiums.

Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace.
KHALID: You know, Noel, it's always hard to gauge the impact of endorsements. But we do know from polls that there have been a large share of late-deciding voters and that they have been going more for Joe Biden. So what I will say is it's unclear, but we will have more clarity after tonight.
Public opinion has grown more favorable as major changes appeared imminent. A Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll in late February found 48 percent having a favorable opinion versus 42 percent viewing the law unfavorably. Kaiser says the shift is due largely to a change in the view of political independents, among which 50 percent now view the law favorably.
It's not a familiar world for Julie, with her privileged upbringing and posh London apartment. Her desire to shed light on the lives of the less fortunate is nothing if not well-intentioned and spurred, in part, by the harsh deprivations of the Thatcher regime. But it also runs the risk of seeming both inauthentic and condescending. The question of who has the right to tell whose story is one that artists seem to be asking themselves a lot these days. And Hogg gently and sympathetically critiques her own youthful naivete in the matter.
ORNSTEIN: If we're talking about the general issue of whether there should be things like earmarks, targeted programs through direct funding or authorizing things or through tax legislation that can benefit a particular industry or a particular district or state, you can make a strong case - and I've made it before - that these are not illegitimate things to do. What happened is that the earmarking process, which goes back right to the beginning of the Republic, worked reasonably well because most of the lawmakers put some boundaries around it. They made sure it wasn't abused.
INSKEEP: Do you feel that you know how to take the great fame that you have won over the last several months and turn that fame into power?
[There was no official determination that the private server was illegal, although the State Department inspector general found it was not approved and would not have been had Clinton asked. — Carrie Johnson]
FAHRENTHOLD: Sure. The Palm Beach Police Foundation is a client of Trump's. They pay to rent out Mar-a-Lago every year. So a few years ago he decided to give them a donation, but he didn't actually use his money or even the money in his foundation. Instead, he approached another foundation, the foundation of a deceased friend, and asked them. He said, look; I'm collecting money for the Palm Beach Police Foundation; can you give me some?
And here's the bonus ... and one of the keys to tax reform. A 20 percent tax on all imports would produce an estimated $1.2 trillion over 10 years, enough to offset much of the loss in revenue from the big reduction in tax rates that Republicans want, including dropping from a 35 percent rate to 20 percent for corporations.
NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro spoke to a variety of people in different cities about what their lives look like on $100,000 a year. On paper, that kind of salary is considered well-off. But as we heard from many, it often takes just one major expense for that to not feel like enough: student loans, health care, childcare or housing costs.
I'm hell bent on making these credits permanent, Neal said.
First, they'd capture the methane or biogas that's being emitted from rotting food, cow manure, wastewater and sewage treatment plants. They'd clean it and put the resulting biomethane, or renewable natural gas, into the company's pipelines.
Trump and House leaders are setting this up as a binary choice for Republicans: Do you want to keep Obamacare and break your pledge to your voters to repeal it? Or do you want to vote for this bill, which they admit isn't perfect, but which they promise will get better as the legislative process moves along, and which GOP leaders insist is far better than the Affordable Care Act.
Because congressional rules limit the overall size of the tax cut, tax relief for businesses and the wealthy leaves fewer savings to spread around to everyone else.

Seated at the same table as him at the union hall in Canton was another veteran steelworker, 53-year-old Trisha Hostetler. She jumped in with a litany of concerns she has about Trump, starting with his comments about women and minorities.
Seeking to help them, Modi's government in September passed three new agriculture laws: The Farmers Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, The Farmers' Produce Trade & Commerce Act, and The Essential Commodities Act. The preamble to the first law says it aims to protect and empower farmers to engage with wholesalers, exporters and retailers in a fair and transparent manner.
That's not a huge amount spent on infrastructure, which may be why Trump seems to believe that no building happened.
The Ohio governor and Florida senator are drawing support from many mainstream Republicans. What about Trump?
SNELL: Right now it seems like there is not much of a question about if they will do that; it's just a matter of how much they will send. And it goes, actually, back to your question of whether or not this will go to everybody or if it'll have to be tailored in some way. Republicans are saying that, you know, there might need to be some sort of income cutoff and maybe have the check be related to how large the family size is or how much income you are losing out on.

Trump just happens to have won counties that have a large share of routine jobs, as economist Jed Kolko pointed out at FiveThirtyEight last month. And while it's true that many factors beyond economic anxiety clearly played into people's votes for Trump, anxiety about the future of these jobs may have helped push people into his camp, Kolko writes.
They may not choose candidates in smoke-filled convention rooms, but they have their own way of pushing particular candidates. (Limiting the number of primary debates or deliberately putting them on low-TV-viewership nights are a couple of examples Cohen cites.)

Together, the expansive funding network revealed in this report demonstrates that the Islamophobia Network cannot be considered a marginal or passing phenomenon in American society. Rather, it is a prominent and shameful institutional feature of American philanthropy, the report said. These foundations have donated across a wide range, from the [minuscule] amount of $20 to the staggering sum of $32 million.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor followed up: It has been used to create a watchlist at the border for charitable organizations, people who were giving legal advice at the border ... because they potentially violated this encouragement provision. And, noted Sotomayor, there was a prosecution in the case of a woman who advised her housekeeper that if you return to your home country, you may not get back.

The deal was reached after a flurry of closed-door meetings between Republican negotiators that began last week and continued around the clock in recent days. The talks centered on resolving differences between the two largely similar tax bills that passed the House and the Senate over the past several weeks.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right, let's talk about the things that the president promised on the campaign trail - building the border wall, affordable health care, bringing back jobs. There's a lot there, but I'd like to know where you think he's done well and where you'd still like to see him do more. Let's start with you, Rena.
DETROW: I think it's notable that nobody else followed Castro's lead, and Castro dropped that after that first back-and-forth and did not return to that line of attack.
GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: David Blumberg runs a venture capital fund with hundreds of millions of dollars in assets. He's a fourth-generation Californian with deep roots in the San Francisco Bay Area. But late last year, like many active in California's tech scene, he decided it was time to move - in his case, to Florida.
KING: As you mentioned, after Super Tuesday, Joe Biden definitely looks like the front-runner. Has Bernie Sanders done anything to try to change the momentum?
Since vaccine distribution began in the U.S. in December, more than 93 million doses have been administered, reaching about 18.4% of the U.S. population. The first two vaccines, approved late last year, require two shots. Last month, the Food and Drug Administration authorized emergency use of a third vaccine option that requires just one shot.
Biden's move is in stark contrast to the Trump administration's approach. As COVID-19 took hold last spring and the economy imploded, health experts pleaded with the Trump administration to open up the federal marketplace so people could buy insurance to protect themselves during the worst public health emergency in a century. The administration declined, noting that people who suddenly found themselves without coverage because they lost their jobs were able to sign up on the marketplace under ordinary rules. They also cited concerns that sick people who had resisted buying insurance before would buy coverage and drive up premiums.
There is no greater joy. But to see young parents struggling so hard, and to see older people taking care of their parents. We've got work to do. We shouldn't make it so difficult to do your job at home and to do the job that puts food on the table and a roof over your head.
In 2010, eight farmers in the grape-growing region of Nashik, in western India, banded together to create a collective called Sahyadri Farms, to sell their produce directly to retailers. It's now co-owned by more than 10,000 farmers, and is India's biggest exporter of grapes, with 17% of the European market for table grapes, the company claims.
INSKEEP: Indeed. Thanks very much, Cokie.
KING: Italy has these restrictions now where people's travel is limited except for work or for emergencies. Do you envision the same thing happening in the United States?
Bus service was canceled in Detroit on Tuesday, after many drivers refused to work out of concern for the coronavirus. Their complaints range from the capacity of buses to carry far more than the 10 people federal health experts currently recommend as a maximum for public gatherings to insufficient cleaning and sanitizing measures.
But it's also not a guarantee of future success, and if Ossoff wins, for example, he'd start out with a target on his back in 2018, when the weird dynamics of a multicandidate field aren't in play and he'd have much more trouble raising millions of dollars if he isn't the only game in town.
And then there's big city public transit agencies.

If the market is ready to pay me a better price, I should capture that instead of depending on government, Shinde says. Another real game-changer is technology. E-commerce is becoming a common thing, auction platforms are becoming a common thing, even for our smaller farmers – especially for them.
To support the transportation sector, the legislation allocates nearly $30 billion for transit costs, including payroll and personal protective equipment; $8 billion for airports; $3 billion for a temporary payroll support program to help support the aerospace manufacturing industry; and $1.5 billion to recall and pay Amtrak employees who were furloughed because of the pandemic and to restore various daily routes. Another $15 billion will also be allocated to support workers in the airline industry.
HORSLEY: It looks like it. The House is scheduled to vote on Tuesday and the Senate on Wednesday. President Trump said this week, as long as he gets the bill before Christmas, the IRS will have withholding tables ready by February. So paychecks or direct deposits should begin to reflect the new tax rates by then.
RAZ: Ah, the sound of an Internet modem. Sounds quaint now, doesn't it? And yet, that was how most people got online just a few short years ago. Today for most of us, connecting to the Internet sounds like this.
KELLY: Why do Republicans in your states say changes like this are necessary given that there were no major issues with absentee voting in the 2020 election, given that federal officials have confirmed it was the most secure election in American history? Steven, Ben, do one of you want to take that one?
It seems remarkably simple, which is [that] one of the best ways of increasing the likelihood that people will show up to court once they're released is to send them a reminder. I think that's the first piece. A lot of people with community ties can be released without bail, and they will show up to court if you are providing reminders to do it.
When the tax overhaul passed in 2017, fewer than half of Americans approved of it. Then-House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, promised that more people would grow to like the tax plan once it took effect.
DETROW: What's a top-line number of a bill that you could have supported? This, of course, is $1.9 trillion.

Week In Politics: Biden And 2020
Among Republicans — even those worried about climate change — the package, with its liberal economic ideas, will also likely be a nonstarter.
BROWN: Now, marginal tax rates went as high as 94 percent in the mid-'40s. It was also 91 percent as late as 1963. We had a 70 percent marginal tax rate as late as 1980. And currently, our marginal tax rate is 37 percent. So we've had very high marginal tax rates for many, many years, and we've had lower marginal tax rates.
LIASSON: So a border adjustment tax or a tax on imports, not exports, is like a tax on the trade deficit. It's something that over 160 countries already do, including Mexico. But it's something that just two weeks ago Trump criticized as being too complicated. Now it sounds like Trump is admitting that the Mexican government is not going to pay for the wall, and Paul Ryan's plan is a way to get himself out of that box. So score one for Paul Ryan and the Mexican government.
We will work with House Republicans on this plan, using the same brackets they have proposed: 12, 25 and 33 percent.
Republicans used the hearing to try to undercut Cohen, who has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and will soon begin serving a three-year prison sentence. While Cohen tried to show he was a changed man who regretted protecting Trump — whom he branded a racist, con man and cheat in his testimony — GOP lawmakers argued that Cohen was more interested in rebuilding his image and setting himself up for financial profit post-incarceration.
In Pennsylvania, a decades-old law guarantees a minimum 12.5 percent royalty. But the state's Supreme Court has ruled that deductions can still be taken, even if they cut into that rate. For four years, mineral owners have pushed to keep that from happening, but so far the Legislature has not passed a bill.
Afraid of upsetting their base, though, Republicans have refused to work with Democrats on health care in any serious way.

The plan would allow corporations to subtract export sales when calculating their tax bill, but companies would not be allowed to deduct the cost of imports. Under the current tax code, export sales are taxed, and import costs are deductible.
Buttigieg's national press secretary, Chris Meagher, added in a statement: The Vice President's decision to run this ad speaks more to where he currently stands in this race than it does about Pete's perspective as a mayor and a veteran.
PLUTA: Her efforts to force Republicans to adopt her ideas led to a standoff that delayed adopting a state budget by the constitutional deadline. There are still hard feelings, but the governor has not given up on her efforts to raise the fuel tax.
LAFFER: There's a risk in all policy going forward. But when you look at tax policy, what you really want to do is try to get bipartisan support, like we had under Reagan, with both our sets of tax bills.

LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: That's right, Renee. It's actually a makeshift courthouse because this trial had to be moved to a convention center. The regular courthouse simply isn't big enough to house such an unprecedented trial. With 18 defendants, TV crews are here from all over the world. The whole trial is airing live on Spanish TV. There's a cordon of hundreds of police here circling the building. They had to clear a path between all the TV cameras for the princess and her husband to walk into the building this morning. Inside, they're sitting in a bank of defendants' chairs with cameras pointed at them from all sides. I'm in an overflow press room next door. You can hear one of the defendants testifying behind me. The princess is staring straight ahead. She is dressed quite casually in a navy blue sweater and slacks. She's not allowed to sit next to her codefendant husband. He's three chairs over. And there are no windows in this courtroom, which may be just as well, because if the defendants could look outside, they'd see barbed wire and a watchtower. We're actually right across the street from Majorca's prison, where Cristina and her husband could end up if convicted.

CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: Critics of cash bail have a name for it. They call it the poor people's tax, leaving those who can't come up with the money for bail stuck in jail while they wait for their case to be heard. Fifty-seven-year-old Flonard Wrencher says he knows all about that.
So the total and complete thing is sort of hyperbolic bravado, which is very Trumpian. But Comey did confirm that on three occasions he told Trump that he was not under investigation, something that Trump desperately wanted the American people to hear from someone other than himself, someone with credibility in law enforcement. And I think that was a source of one of his major frustrations...

A number of advocates for legalization have also criticized the bill, saying it would lead to new categories of crime that would fall disproportionately on communities of color.

President Trump's first two weeks in office have been a sprint, not the start of a marathon. If the rapid pace and, sometimes, hourly developments of executive orders, news, controversies and more have left you exhausted, you're not alone. If you're finding it hard to remember just everything that's transpired too, we're here for that as well.
ELVING: Which can sometimes be a great unifying strategy. It just didn't seem to catch tonight.
TANKERSLEY: That's going to be, I think, the central fight of this bill, the question of will big tax cuts - and it's a very big tax cut for corporations - turn into higher wages for middle-class families? The argument on the Republican side of that is that if you give companies more money and higher profits, they will invest it. They'll invest it in their workers, and their workers will see wage gains. The argument against that is that, no, corporations will pass most of that money on to their shareholders in terms of dividends, or they'll just pocket the money - sit on the profits. And that, I think, will be one of the big debate points as we move forward here.
GREENE: So could all this affect the impeachment trial in the Senate?

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer has said the president's refusal to release his taxes could undercut his push for tax reform.

In West Palm Beach, some of those marching said they'd taken part in protests almost every weekend since Trump was sworn in.

Instead, they retreated from their battle positions for a few hours at best, never getting to know the stranger they insulted. And I moved on, and just kept tweeting.
HOULAHAN: So actually, in talking to a lot of people who are, I guess, would be self-described as Republicans or independents, I actually haven't found a whole lot of people who fit that bill. Most of the folks in my community particularly, who may have voted for President Trump, have now realized that the tax bill that did pass is not necessarily one that is good for them personally, particularly in Pennsylvania. As you probably know, we are one of those state and local tax places. And so that tax bill isn't particularly good for our community, for property values, for schools and that sort of thing. I think also, increasingly, people have come to, relatively speaking, embrace the Affordable Care Act more certainly than they had in the beginning. They, at least in my conversations with them, would like to see the Affordable Care Act shored up to some degree to make sure that we have affordable care. And so I don't think that I have personally run into a lot of people who are Republicans or independents who necessarily have that narrative of why they voted for President Trump.
TRUMP: In other words, if interest rates go up and we can buy bonds back at a discount - if we are liquid enough as a country, we should do that.

It's only wrong 93% of the time in the scanning of ballots requiring a review panel to adjudicate or determine the voter's interest in over 106,000 ballots out of a total of 113,000.
Bringing America together when the trials it faces are, in many cases, the most dire they've been in recent history will prove difficult. And Biden is not shying away from bold initiatives, many of which Republicans are sure to disagree with.
The party was not dominant in the South, as it is today. In fact, it had a strong foothold in the Northeast. It was Democrats who had long dominated in the South — Dixie-crats, they were sometimes called.
Since the 1994 takeover, Democrats have controlled the House in just two sessions of Congress, from 2007 to 2011. That was when the Iraq War was raging and the economy collapsed under a Republican president and then in the first two years of the historic Obama presidency.
That process allows the party in control of Congress to pass most big-dollar legislation with a simple 51-vote majority in the Senate without having to worry about a filibuster.
He is a personal assistant to Bill Clinton. He ran a consulting company that paid Bill Clinton a lot of money until 2012. He is also the head of Clinton's Global Initiative which gets together muckety mucks from all over the world for big charity events, and he's with the Clinton Foundation. So to figure out at any one time which hat someone like Doug Band is wearing when he communicates with aides to Hillary Clinton is a bit of a puzzle.
As a parent, I can tell you it's a really very difficult decision. It's not clear cut. It doesn't really matter — and I empathize with the teachers too — what scientists and doctors say if you feel that this is too much of a risk to your health or your family's health to do. ... People are really polarized and they're really hardened, and I get it. On the one hand, it's really terrifying that your kids could get sick. And on the other hand, it's really, really hard to have your kids out of school, not just in terms of your day and getting your work done, but in terms of how obvious it is what we're seeing happen with the kids who are struggling. They're lonely; they're anxious. Their entire lives — in some cases, a quarter or an eighth of their entire lives — has just been upended.
Transcript: NPR's Interview With Bernie Sanders
Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small business, to lower tax rates for hard-working Americans, Trump said in touting the new tax law. The president also promised that this year will be the last time you will ever file under the old and very broken system. And millions of Americans will have more take-home pay, starting next month. A lot more.
RAZ: So a smaller computer, Bolt, Beranek and Newman, got the contract, and it built a device called the IMP, the Interface Message Processor. It was as big as two full-sized gym lockers. Charlie Kline explains how it worked.
The International Monetary Fund gave Tunisia a loan worth $2.9 billion in 2015. The organization frequently imposes conditions on loans to recipient countries, such as lowering the budget deficit.
KEITH: Yes. That was his mild cursing.
Still, Sanjay Gohad is worried. He's a middleman whose family has spent 40 years paying into the APMC system. He buys produce in bulk from farmers and sells it onward to retail outlets. He thinks the government's reforms will lead to less competition, not more.
The Claim: There was a very large infrastructure bill that was approved during the Obama administration, $1 trillion, and nobody ever saw anything being built. To this day I haven't heard of anything that's been built. They took this money and used it on social programs.
Also in the bill is $25 billion for emergency rental assistance and an expanded tax credit for low-income workers without children.
Trump spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham issued a statement saying the president hasn't been tested because he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms.
SCHUMER: No, here is what we're proposing, which is to greatly expand unemployment benefits. Right now unemployment benefits are limited. Only a limited number of people can get them. Gig workers and many others can't get them. When you get them, they don't pay very high percentage of your salary. And it's cumbersome, takes a long time to apply and to get them.
But without an individual mandate bringing enough people into the insurance pool and no financial assistance, she adds, the price of plans is just out of reach financially for many consumers.
SCHRAGER: (Laughter) Hang in there, Rach (ph). It's going to be OK. I love you.
A Trump Administration will end this war on the American worker, and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country. According to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on all sources of American energy will: Increase GDP by more than $100 billion dollars annually, add over 500,000 new jobs annually, and increase annual wages by more than $30 billion dollars over the next 7 years; Increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion dollars over 4 decades; Increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion dollars over the next 40 years. The reforms I have outlined today are only the beginning When we reform our tax, trade, energy and regulatory policies, we will open a new chapter in American Prosperity. We can use this new wealth to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.
--Trump himself stands to gain tens of millions: This plan would be a windfall for Trump. He pays taxes for his businesses through the income tax code, so his plan would slash his own tax liability potentially in half, saving himself tens of millions of dollars.
What lessons could both disasters learn from each other?
We never had the authority to have a grant program like this, nor ever one so large, Carson says.
There's a huge return in it for me, McCall says. I get happier employees. My CFO feels great about doing the books for this cool nonprofit, and that makes him want to stay with us. We get all sorts of props around town for starting this cool nonprofit. That's great. I love that. Does it help us get business? It probably has helped us get business. There's no shame in that, either.
An analysis of Trump's plan by The Commonwealth Fund estimates it would increase the number of people who lack health insurance by as many as 25 million, and increase the federal budget by as much as $41 billion. That's because much of Trump's plan involves giving tax breaks to encourage people to buy insurance while taking away the requirement to buy insurance — a mandate embedded in Obamacare.

Capping the amount of health benefits that workers can accept free of taxes would reduce incentives for employers to continue to offer coverage, said Georgetown University's Sabrina Corlette.
HASSETT: You're right to focus on the deficit in the long run, but I think that the policies that we've pursued are sound ones.
We have about 1.4 million Californians shopping in our marketplace picking private plans with the leg up of federal tax credits that make health care affordable to 90 percent of them, Lee says.
INSKEEP: Domenico, thanks very much for the insight. Really appreciate it.
It's a basic human right to manage your body with dignity, she says. In Kenya, the lack of sex education means girls are often shocked when they first get their period. Mukuria met one who thought she'd contracted Ebola, while Onyango tells the story of another who assumed someone had pricked her in the middle of the night.
There have been pushes by the NRA and Republican lawmakers to allow more military personnel to carry firearms on base, following mass shootings at Fort Hood in 2009 and the Washington, D.C., Navy Yard in 2013, but the Department of Defense has not changed its position. Under Trump, it might.
And, you know, I feel very - sometimes, you know, I am telling the right thing because a lot of people - it's not just myself - a lot of people are in my situation, that you follow the American dream. You do the correct things, and in the end, maybe it doesn't work for you, and why, you know. So I don't think blame should be the word I should use. But I think - I think at least, you know, the president is trying to address the immigration reform. That's a positive thing.
Laszlo Keri, who is a former political science professor of Orbán's, agreed. He said he's sure his former pupil will do whatever it takes to win another term as prime minister during upcoming national elections on April 8.

The American Rescue Plan is one of the most popular bills in decades for a reason, wrote Schumer. It's one of the most significant anti-poverty bills in modern American history that will help millions and millions who are struggling just to get by.
MCEVERS: So how is the Trump Foundation different from other family foundations?
Democrats Unveil Measure To Help Communities Impacted By Coronavirus
The new Trump ad, called Two Americas: Economy, portrays Clinton's policies as bad for the middle class, while promising new jobs if Trump is elected.
Even as he prepares to step aside, Vance hinted at the continuing work in the investigation of Trump. Our investigations and trials – from the high-profile to the ones that never make the newspaper – will proceed, Vance wrote in a memo to prosecutors and staff.
Over in Bradford County, Barrett just wants to protect his family's legacy. Every farmer would say they want their farm to continue, he says.
Even after that, Biden's environmental rules are likely to be challenged by lawsuits, potentially reaching the Supreme Court and adding years to the process. Future administrations could also undo those rules, just as the Trump administration did.
: There is another argument made on behalf of unemployment benefits. It runs roughly this way: Give an unemployed worker a check, and it goes straightaway to buying food and children's shoes and gasoline. Give an employed person the same amount in, say, a tax break, and it could just sit in the bank and wouldn't stimulate the economy. Is that true?
If you look at the most wealthy, the top 1 percent would get about half of the benefits of his tax cuts, and a millionaire, for example, would get an average tax cut of $317,000, she says.
2018 Administration Priority: Overhauling U.S. Trade Policy
SAGAL: No because I - this is - one of the great things about your career as the mayor of Newark is you were constantly, like, doing stuff for people. You were out shoveling walks and - but there was an incident during - it was during Hurricane Sandy, right?
There are 20 leaders on the steering committee of the RSC, which has a membership of the majority of GOP members — 150.
The right-leaning Tax Foundation released an analysis Monday that said Trump's campaign would shrink federal revenues by as much as $5.9 trillion over 10 years. His former plan would have done so by up to $12.3 trillion.
The government hasn't helped: It's ordered Twitter to suspend accounts that tweeted support for the farmers or criticism of its treatment of them. It arrested a young climate activist on suspicion of sedition for allegedly sharing tips on how to drum up support for the protests online. Its authoritarian tactics have grabbed headlines, burying the agriculture debate even further.
On the mortgage interest deduction, the House wanted to limit that to mortgages of half a million dollars. The Senate wanted to leave the cap where it was at a million dollars. They split the difference, so interest is going to be deductible on mortgages up to $750,000. The bill also doubles the size of estates that can be passed on to heirs tax-free. That means it's a $22 million exemption for couples. And a provision in the House bill that would've taxed graduate students on the value of tuition waivers - that's now gone.
NPR's politics team has annotated Clinton's portion of the speech below. Portions we commented on are in boldface, followed by analysis and fact check in italics.
Earlier in the day, President Trump praised Justice for his handling of the spread of the virus, by treating it differently than a New York or California. Calling him Big Jim, Trump said Justice must be doing a good job of that. ... West Virginia is the only one that has no cases.
He basically took the money they gave him - $150,000 - and passed it directly onto the Palm Beach Police Foundation without adding any money of his own. As a result, Trump wins an award for his philanthropy, and the Charles Evans Foundation doesn't get any recognition in that transaction.
I think the financial system of the US is in great shape and is prepared to handle this problem Mnuchin said.
In the months leading up to the vote in Philadelphia, the American Beverage Association spent more than $4.2 million in media buys to turn public opinion against the tax. The ABA is currently supporting a campaign to defeat the initiatives in California.
NPR's Rachel Martin talks to Michelle Singletary, who writes about personal finance for The Washington Post, about what people can do during the coronavirus outbreak to ensure more financial security.
ROBERT COSTA: Great to be here.
INSKEEP: When we last heard from Scott Horsley, he was NPR's White House correspondent - now chief economics correspondent. Scott, thanks so much.
We have [solutions], Rodriguez says, but it requires citizens to have the compassion and the empathy to work with us to help address this problem.
Let's look at the map going forward. Even though your surprise win in Michigan was the big headline of the night, Secretary Clinton actually came out of last night's contests with a wider delegate lead than before after her strong win in Mississippi. She's now more than 200 pledged delegates ahead of you, not including the superdelegates.
GROSS: Another issue related to nursing homes and to hospital care and to home health care is that a lot of the nurses and home health care workers, I think, are really underpaid. And I think it's a weakness in the system. We expect, we demand so much of them. And some of them are making so little in return. And I think it sometimes shows up in the care that you get.
In a statement, the Coalition welcomed the fee as a boost to communities. Unique to our state, Pennsylvania's impact tax continues to be a winning policy solution for the Commonwealth, it said.
They gave these people bad things to vote for and they voted because what did they know? And then when they found out a few weeks later, again, it took them four years to devise this screen.
KING: Diane Swonk is an adviser to the Federal Reserve and the chief economist of Grant Thornton. Thank you, Diane.
GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Jonathan Cohn. He's the author of the new book called The Ten Year War: Obamacare And The Unfinished Crusade For Universal Coverage. Jonathan, we have to take another break here. And then we'll talk some more. So we'll be right back. I'm Terry Gross. And this is FRESH AIR.
SAGAL: ...You'd be wearing a touch-sensitive screen on your wrist, right, of one your hands. So people...
Biden is aiming to at least bring down the temperature and bring back a degree of traditional Washington comity. That was evident not just in his inaugural address, but Tuesday night in the somber ceremony in front of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, remembering the 400,000 Americans who have died from COVID-19.
Note: This post reflects earlier tax overhaul bills as passed by the House and Senate. For a look at the final version of the bill as passed by the House and Senate conference committee, go here.
As a leader of the globalist wing in the White House, Cohn was also overruled when the president announced plans to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord.
PROOPS: Oh, I thank you, Peter. You've given me a wonderful clue. I'm going to say their tongues.
Kennedy also mentioned the #MeToo movement borne out of the growing disclosures about sexual harassment and sexual assault in multiple industries and talked of the efforts of Black Lives Matter — two things Trump did not touch on.
In terms of sustained costs, birth control is probably the biggest, said Caroline Pearson, a senior vice president at Avalere Health.
Progressives Show Patience With Biden, At Least Until Relief Bill Passes
OCASIO-CORTEZ: Exactly. That's exactly the choice I made. (Laughter).
SHAPIRO: I know you have a reputation for modesty, but you have put a lot of effort, muscle, time and also dollars into conservative causes in the state of North Carolina. So I'm curious why you're not going to put that effort, time and dollars into the Donald Trump campaign.
But it's still another big blow for the tourist industry. Europeans account for about 30% of international visitors at this time of year. So it's going to be another hit for airlines, hotels, tourist attractions and the notion of international commerce.
So as an example, in Pennsylvania, or whatever, you have a Republican legislature, you have a Democrat mayor, and you have a lot of Democrats all over the place. They go to the legislature. The legislature laughs at them, says we're not going to do that. They say, thank you very much and they go and make the changes themselves, they do it anyway. And that's totally illegal. That's totally illegal. You can't do that.
President-elect Donald Trump met Wednesday afternoon with a who's-who of the tech industry. They came from Silicon Valley and elsewhere to Trump Tower in Manhattan, where they talked about jobs and innovation.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. So we're going to have congressional Republicans now meet to try and hash out the differences between the House and the Senate plans. Can't some of these problems be resolved then?
The poll shows that 70 percent of Americans believe taxes should be raised on people making $250,000 to just under $1 million, and that 75 percent believe they should be raised on people making $1 million or more.
A House Democratic aide said the package was valued at $2.5 trillion and focused on boosting healthcare access, unemployment insurance, the healthcare industry and payments to workers, among other issues. Pelosi has not said whether the House would move forward with its proposal. The chamber could take up the Senate bill if more changes are made to it that satisfy Democrats' concerns.

On Jan. 25, the 100th day of anti-government protests, Khairallah was back on the streets, weaving his way through thousands of people waving Lebanese flags and chanting slogans against the government, to show the power that we are here and we are not afraid.
INSKEEP: And Robert, let's begin with you. We reported elsewhere that Republicans are speaking today before a pro-Israel group. But who else is Donald Trump meeting today?
SHIELDS: (As narrator) Taxes will keep democracy on the march.
ELVING: Yes, absolutely. Now, of course, this is necessary to set guidelines. The actual spending bills will come later. But the reason they were so eager to get this done is that it sets the stage and the rules for the tax overhaul bill that is going to dominate the rest of the year on Capitol Hill. And now, because of the rules that they pass, it is immune from a filibuster. And that means it can pass with just 50 votes, where they use vice president's tiebreaking vote to win. And that means that this tax bill actually has a fighting chance of happening later this year or early in 2018.
Still, no longer having to deal with the confusing paperwork of the current system, and knowing his employees are covered, sounds really good, Wall says. Orman calls it a step in the right direction.
Baylor called that sort of self-evident, rather than the kind of shift in policy his organization is advocating.
There are sometimes policy reasons for temporary provisions, said Doug Holtz-Eakin, director of the Congressional Budget Office during the George W. Bush administration and now the president of the right-leaning American Action Forum. In this case, I think it's fair to say this is largely driven by the requirement that you cannot create $1.5 trillion in additional deficits over 10 years.

FOWLER: Well, Mary Louise, after the last couple months of hand-wringing over votes, we've seen top Republican lawmakers in Georgia say that they're not going to do some of the more extreme proposals. They're not for cutting no-excuse absentee voting, and many of these bills are likely just to appease their constituents who say that more needs to be done.
In a statement Monday, Trump denounced the case as political persecution and said, The Supreme Court never should have let this 'fishing expedition' happen, but they did.
We can both stimulate the economy ... and we can lay the foundation for a lower-carbon future.

The system is supposed to prevent a felon or someone who is mentally ill from purchasing a gun, but it has obstacles like underfunding and inaccurate, out-of-date data.

Today in a major state-run editorial, they said they'll buy $200 billion worth of U.S. goods over the next two years, but only if those goods are priced competitively and that they benefit the companies.

Mr. McALLISTER: Well, there's been a buildup. People forget that George W. Bush wasn't popular in 2004. 2006 and 2008, Republicans were so disgusted with Republicans in Washington that they stayed home or they voted for the other side of the aisle, which is why the proof is in the pudding that there were conservatives that were highly upset with the Bush administration, particularly the second half of the Bush administration.

Yes, Africans are named in the the Panama Papers. Some 18 public officials, ranging from the former president of Sudan, Ahmed Ali al-Mirghani, to the son of former U.N. secretary general Kofi Annan have been linked to the scandal.
[This is a frequent campaign promise from Trump, but his own hiring practices haven't always reflected this view. A recent Buzzfeed article detailed Trump's effort to bring in foreign guest workers for his Mar-a-Lago resort.

WU: I don't know that they played a bad hand. They played the hand that they had. Judge Ellis - I've been before him, and he is a little bit territorial - doesn't necessarily like outsiders coming into the Eastern District of Virginia and doing their cases that way. So there may have been a little bit of a sense that these were carpetbaggers coming in, but I don't know that Manafort's attorneys looked like local Virginia attorneys either.
MONTANARO: Well, they're going to start work on this next week, and that's kind of the big piece of it. Of course, this is already shaping up to be a big partisan fight. You know, there's money - money is always a sharp dividing line within the parties. It indicates priorities, and Democratic leaders are calling this a big giveaway to the rich.

The opportunity lay in a high-capacity transmission line that runs all the way from Coal Creek Station to Minneapolis. Closing Coal Creek would free up that line, sweeping aside one of the key roadblocks that have slowed the growth of wind energy in North Dakota.
In the House version of the tax bill, these bonds lose their tax exempt status. So Yantel says this bedrock funding mechanism gets destroyed. This essentially eliminates nearly half of the affordable homes that can be developed or preserved throughout the country with the low-income tax credit program.

What Does Being A U.S. Territory Mean For Puerto Rico?
I like conflict, the president told reporters at a news conference Thursday afternoon. I like having people with two different points of view. And I certainly have that. And then I make a decision. But I like watching it. I like seeing it. I think it's the best way to go. I like different points of view.
TANKERSLEY: I think it's very unlikely that this particular package exactly as it's proposed will pass. We know it's going to change to some degree. But will it change dramatically where a lot of the popular deductions end up staying? Will it change and scale back the rate cuts because Republicans, particularly in the Senate, are worried about adding $1.5 trillion to deficits? We don't know. This is a first discussion point and that there will be a lot of negotiations between Republicans with each other and with business lobbyists in particular over the next few weeks as they try to speed this through Congress.
Let's get to work, Ohio. Let's knock on doors and register voters. Let's send Ted Strickland to the Senate with Sherrod Brown. Let's send Alicia Reece back to Columbus. Let's get more strong progressive leaders like Sen. Warren in Washington and statehouses.
Then, as Avenatti and Daniels's lawsuit worked its way forward, the FBI raided Cohen's hotel room, office and home in New York City. Prosecutors revealed they'd been conducting a criminal investigation for months into his business dealings.
What's more, next year is an election year, and the campaign for 2020, believe it or not, is right around the corner. The likelihood is if Democrats want to take down Trump, they're going to have to do it at the ballot box.
Many elements of the bill, aside from a $15 minimum wage, have widespread support among Democrats and are expected to become law at least temporarily.
The group says the grants are needed to defray the costs of paid leave and ensure the workforce is available to continue working on the project in Waynesboro, Ga., later.
Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive and free trade advocate, announced his plans to resign Tuesday, less than a week after Trump called for stiff tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.

Last month, Vance's office received Trump's tax returns following a years-long battle with the former president, after the Supreme Court paved the way for a New York grand jury to obtain and review the financial documents. Trump broke decades of precedent when he refused to release his tax returns during and after the 2016 presidential campaign after first pledging to do so.
Numerous countries already have financial transaction taxes, and, we should note, their track record is mixed. Sweden adopted one in 1984, which they kept tweaking to try to get to work. By 1986, if you bought or sold a stock through a Swedish brokerage firm, you faced a 1% tax. Foreign brokerage firms, however, were exempt — as a result half of all stock trading moved from Sweden to London. Meanwhile, the tax never raised much revenue, so it was eliminated in the early 1990s.
Biden also denied that progressives are frustrated with the series of compromises that led to the bill's approval. Notably, House Democrats' original version of the bill included a since-scrapped provision to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025, while Senate Democrats agreed to lower the income cutoff for stimulus checks to meet the demands of moderate members of the party.
MONTAGNE: Well, let's talk about the Democrats for a few minutes now. Who ever would've thought, really, that this would be the second nominating contest to be decided this year after the Republicans? But as Paul Ryan points out, speaker of the House, Bernie Sanders keeps winning primaries, as Bernie Sanders would point out as well. He also is making the argument that he would do better with Clinton against Trump in a national election. Does he - is there something to that, Cokie?
Around the time of the standoff though, the Bundys frequently said they didn't recognize the federal government, let alone its legal right to control public land. A trove of TV news footage from the time shows militiamen pointing assault-style rifles at federal agents.

And she said, well, I'm coming over there and wash your mouth out with soap. I said, Mom, these were bad people; they were hurting me and my friends; they were very bad people. She said, that's no excuse; under no circumstances did I ever teach you to use language like that (laughter).
Starting a car company from scratch isn't easy. Just ask Tesla. That company has hemorrhaged money, missed deadlines and freaked out investors. And it's considered a success. Other EV startups haven't even made it to market.
People who believe in the filibuster system say it would disincentivize negotiation and bipartisanship — and would make the laws Congress passes nothing more than partisan whims.
KAHN: Well, first of all, it's unclear if it would come to that. With Mexico, just the threat of tariffs worked. The threats got them to jump into action and send new National Guard force to the southern and northern borders. And they began deporting tens of thousands of Central Americans. But if tariffs did go into place, it would be devastating to Guatemala's already fragile economy. The U.S. is its No. 1 trading partner. And then if remittances were taxed, too, that would be a big blow. Money sent home to Guatemala - get ready - was $9.5 billion last year. And that's nearly 12% of the country's economic activity, their GDP. So it would be cutting a lifeline from them.
Not many physicians have worked with patients at dozens of hospitals throughout the country. Miller has. You pick where you want to go, and you pick where you want to work, she says. Miller does shift work at hospitals that are short on emergency physicians; she lands her gigs through a staffing agency. She has spent quick weekends in North Dakota and New York City, and weeks on a merchant marine ship teaching CPR. The flexibility has allowed her to build up savings and travel frequently. Later this year, she plans to pick up a part-time position for its benefits.
INSKEEP: He also said, we will be back in some form. But Franco, what was left out of that speech?
Major fundraisers are among the people who are key in creating a campaign. And when campaigns fold, they talk sometimes — usually in blind quotes.
Then on Jan. 13, two days after the announcement about Cohen joining the board, GameStop stock jumped 57% — from $19.95 per share to $31.40. The stock got its big kick when Reddit's r/wallstreetbets community — now with more than 4 million members — fawned over a Nov. 16 letter from Cohen to the GameStop board he would later join.
Plus, he thinks the president is receptive to feedback.
We can sit on community advisory boards, act as trustees at educational institutions and serve on the boards of religious organizations and nonprofit groups — so long as those organizations do not engage in significant lobbying or other political activity. We tell our supervisors about such activities and understand that NPR may revoke its approval if there are actual or perceived conflicts of interest.
4. Revamping federal background check process
Among the evidence federal prosecutors gathered on Blagojevich was his now-famous profanity on a phone call, secretly recorded by the FBI, about his attempt to profit from Obama's vacated Illinois Senate seat.
The New Mexico bill also would provide some relief for Leah Steimel's family. Neither she nor her husband has employer-sponsored coverage, and with a family income of about $100,000, they don't qualify for tax credits that would reduce their ACA premiums. They now pay more than $1,900 per month for a silver-level plan with a $10,000 deductible to cover themselves and two of their kids (the third is older than 26).
While Charen still worries about that, she also feels the phrase cancel culture has outgrown its usefulness.

So far the plan's biggest success may be that it's energizing thousands of young activists.
GREENE: Could this turn ugly, I mean, if Mugabe does not step down and the military keeps pressuring him?
We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy.

SCHNEIDER: On the west side of the city, outlet shops are doing brisk business, too. Bridget Sheets is here shopping with her children.
INSKEEP: Good to talk with you, too - our first listener wants to know what the law requires here. Susan Diskin asks, does the Ethics in Government Act require disclosure of tax returns? And if so, why do we not have Trump's?
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will be seated over President Trump's left shoulder Tuesday, less than two months after the Democratic-controlled House impeached him — and just as the Republican-controlled Senate will be deciding whether to keep or remove him from office. (Trump is widely expected to be acquitted because a two-thirds majority is needed to remove a president, and there is no indication that 20 Republicans would side with the Democrats and independents who caucus with them.)
Environmentalists have support from the International Energy Agency (IEA), whose executive director, Fatih Birol, also urged policy-makers to consider climate change when they draft economic stimulus packages.
Americans also appear to have strong views on how people earn their money. We asked people to what degree they agreed with this statement: The tax rate on income from work should be lower than the tax rate on income from wealth.
But there are other areas where it's been more difficult to find agreement over the last seven years – namely what role the government should play in making sure the system's not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations. And here, the American people have a choice to make.
That's the opportunity we have, is to show the world that this is a space that badly needs electrification. Electrification can make those products better than what their gasoline and diesel counterparts had been in the past, Scaringe said.
But even McMullin is clear-eyed about whether, or when, the party will dump Trump. It may take years, if ever, for the Trump fever to break, he said.
I don't think it's a question of us winning over black voters. I think it is a question of Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton having very strong support in the African-American community. And I congratulate them for that.
If they rule something like that, that starts taking away some of the benefits teachers got in the 1960s, you could end up having a wave of strikes in a lot more states.
Lee Miringoff, the director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, said the scope of the shift over the past few months among independents should cause alarm bells to go off at the White House.
The conservatives from within, though, are not necessarily aligned with Trump. In fact, they have shown they are not afraid of either Trump or McConnell. That could mean big problems ahead for what Republicans can get done. Tax reform is a priority for McConnell and Trump. Trump also said he wants to address the nation's aging, crumbling and, in places, dangerous infrastructure and has talked about doing so with a mix of public and private funding intended to generate $1 trillion in infrastructure spending.
For years the political network funded by billionaires Charles and David Koch funded politicians on the right, laying the foundation for the libertarian causes the two support. Their support has gone almost exclusively to Republican candidates, with rare exception.
Mexico perceives cross-border shootings like this one to be a persistent problem. The Mexican government, in a brief filed with the Supreme Court, cited U.S. Customs and Border Protection's own statistics showing that its officers reported use of deadly force involving firearms over 200 times through October 2018, with nearly all of the deadly shootings near the U.S.-Mexico border, and many killings that involved shots fired across the border.
The American Beverage Association, which represents all the big soda brands, led the effort to oppose the soda tax measures. The group spent upwards of $9.5 million on a ad campaign, dubbed Don't Tax Our Groceries.
For decades, oil helped the Saudi royal family keep a compact with the population: Saudis would be taken care of — free health care and education through college, cheap utilities and gasoline, often a government job, and, until recently, no taxes. In return, they did not challenge the royal family's absolute rule.
But for most big legislative items the new president wants, it will require 60 votes from those senators to overcome a filibuster. And McConnell used the filibuster more than any minority leader in history during the Obama years.
In his address to the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday, President Trump vowed to get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution.
This is landmark legislation that would really slash child poverty and target benefits to the lowest-income families that need them the most, says Kris Cox, deputy director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Politics was a very minor consideration for Jim Gauer, a 63-year-old architect and writer, who moved to Canada in 2004. That was right in that prime, Bush-era, emigration wave — but he said the reasons behind moving to Canada weren't very political. Rather, he was tired of New York City's high cost of living. He had recently been to Victoria, in British Columbia, on vacation and had always thought it was a nice city. But he added that today's politics have cemented that his decision was the right one.
KING: What does the president need in order to get this done? Would he have to work with Congress?
The hate groups benefiting include ACT for America, the largest anti-Muslim group in the country and a registered nonprofit. The group is described by the Anti-Defamation League as an organization that stokes irrational fear of Muslims. Others, like CAIR, call it a hate group for its spreading of misinformation about Islam and fearmongering around the principles Muslims live by.
In addition to the Toronto Star, which is Canada's largest daily newspaper, Torstar owns six regional daily newspapers in Ontario and more than 70 weekly community newspapers in the province. It has also made a number of digital investments.
KEITH: Democrats have been talking about using a parliamentary procedure known as the budget reconciliation process, which would allow them to evade the filibuster and pass the package, potentially with a simple majority. And Democrats are preparing this week to begin the first step in that process - working on a budget. Democrats have cited the beginning of the Obama presidency when he was trying to pass a big economic bailout and they tried to get Republican support and they really felt like they ultimately got burned on it, got a smaller package than they wanted, and it took too long. But Republicans have been critical of threats from Democrats to go it alone, saying that Biden promised bipartisanship and unity in his campaign and in his inaugural address. Here is Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, one of the 10 senators in the letter, on Fox News Sunday.
Responding to the newspaper's story Sunday, the California National Guard points out that the repayments are part of a federal program run by the National Guard Bureau and the Department of the Army.
Despite Legalization, Marijuana Black Market Hides In Plain Sight
The bill, drafted by Ryan and other House Republican leaders, cleared a key hurdle Thursday, passing two House committees after marathon markup sessions. But many members from the Tea Party wing are upset that it keeps too much of the Affordable Care Act in place and effectively replaces the law's signature tax with a heavy surcharge assessed to people who forgo health insurance.
ROBERTS: His supporters probably don't, but other people do. Look, this idea that it's none of your business is really not something that a presidential candidate can say. Everything is our business when somebody is running for president. What we know about the vote for president is that it is for the person, not for the policies.
Who Is Stormy Daniels Lawyer Michael Avenatti — And Who Is Helping Him?
Before the provision allowing courts to waive or reduce fees, some activists likened the law to a poll tax.
The answer to this problem has been quite obvious all along, Baylor said. What the administration needs to do is to craft an exemption that prohibits everyone who objects on moral grounds from violating their convictions through the content of their health plan.
ROXANNE ROBERTS: No Peter, what the senator is too modest to say is that everybody likes him. He likes everybody. He's little Mr. Sunshine. He's gorgeous.
I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers or that diminishes our freedom or independence. We will never sign bad trade deals. America First again. America First.
KRISTIN DUNCANSON: We're optimistic that signing the agreement will reopen some opportunities, especially for the upper Midwest. But I'm also a realist enough to know until those beans are actually shipped to customers that we can't count our chickens before they're hatched.
But even before the ban, companies were scaling back from drilling in western towns like Pinedale, if not pulling out all together because it's cheaper to do business on private land in states like Texas or North Dakota.
He cites a study from 2010 that looked at the impact of demographic change on global carbon emissions. It found that slowing population growth could eliminate one-fifth to one-quarter of all the carbon emissions that need to be cut by midcentury to avoid that potentially catastrophic tipping point.
None of this will happen overnight, and yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo. But the jobs we'll create, the money we'll save, and the planet we'll preserve – that's the kind of future our kids and grandkids deserve.

The minimum federal minimum wage is $7.25, though many states have set it higher. Between 1990 and 2015, raising the minimum wage by $1 in each state might have saved more than 27,000 lives, according to a report published this week in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health. An increase of $2 in each state's minimum wage could have prevented more than 57,000 suicides.
WILL STONE, BYLINE: Hello. Great to be here.
That why it's being left out, because it's seen as too controversial right now. The last thing Trump wants is to have the narrative hijacked and turned into how he's proposing to increase the cost of everyone's avocados.
ROMER: The conversation eventually turned to the question of the federal income tax and whether there was some way you can get out of paying it. One of the men around the fire was a lawyer, a man named Jim Knowles.
The man who's recycling this plant and trying to make the first electric truck is Rivian founder and CEO R.J. Scaringe, a 36-year-old car geek with a Ph.D. from MIT in mechanical engineering.
There are a lot of differences between cities and towns and communities in our states and in our country. And I think that this idea that the cities have to be uniform is just not really the American way. Now, that said, there are certain rules that have been passed over time that are national rules, like this national minimum wage. That's a floor, not a ceiling. In the area of civil rights, there are national civil rights laws to prevent discrimination, but that's a floor and not a ceiling.
It was a speech and an ideology that permeated not just that speech and Reagan's presidency, but also marked a bright line and solidified an ideology for generations of conservatives to come.
Has to be about government spending
SWINTON BYRNE: (As Julie) So the material is real. Those people exist. But I am designing new ones to fit what I want to make.
All of which is to say that it's not clear the Trump campaign has settled positions on a range of economic policy issues. These kinds of clarifications and policy shifts give the Clinton campaign ample ammunition for attacking Trump in two ways: one, for potentially harmful economic policies, and two, for not having firm policy principles.
This isn't about Democrats versus Republicans. This goes far beyond that. Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be president of the United States.
Detroit tops the list of the most dangerous cities in terms of violent crime.
JOHNSON: Tomorrow we're going to hear more from this accountant, maybe two hours more, although the judge is trying to get the government to sharpen its questioning. And then I think we're going to hear from at least one more accounting witness as the government tries to roll through the counts in this indictment that deal with tax fraud.
In a statement, the White House also called the meeting productive, but also said the president reiterated his view that Congress must respond boldly and urgently, and noted many areas which the Republican senators' proposal does not address.
But for watchdogs such as Ryan at Common Cause, this casino money — despite these precautions — still ends up helping the DGA's political efforts in Louisiana.
But Romney said he will speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions.
BASS: I remember the meeting extremely well. And I do think it's important to say what led to the meeting because, you remember, there was a press conference in which he was asked about his urban agenda. And a reporter said, have you consulted the Congressional Black Caucus? He didn't know who the CBC was. But he did say to the reporter, who happened to be African-American, well, do you know them? You know, can you organize the meeting? As, of course, all black people do know each other.
DETROW: That's NPR health correspondent Rob Stein.
INSLEE: Well, of course not. Nobody who is going to run for office can make any statement about the future like that, and they're responsible if they do. But what I can say is that the majority of the investment will be private, in part because it will be required. Much of our plan does not involve public investment directly. It is a requirement that the public utilities get off fossil fuels. It is a requirement that the auto industry provide cars for us that don't pollute anymore.
If the virus does spread and consumers and customers stop going out as frequently, he said, I think that's when we'll see a big shift to food delivery, sort of like what we've already seen happen in China.
A new report from Oxfam says that just 1 percent of Amazon owner Jeff Bezos' fortune — estimated at $112 billion — would cover Ethiopia's entire annual health budget. That's health care for 105 million people.
Italy has also been walloped by the virus, with 2,263 confirmed cases, according to its health ministry. COVID-19 is also linked to 79 deaths.

Over the past 18 months, with a decline in oil prices, remittances from Lebanese working in the Gulf also have shrunk. It's causing a reverse sucking motion, Salem says, with people not sending money and trying to pull their money out.
Mona Charen is policy editor at the right-leaning magazine The Bulwark, and worries people canceling each other stifles free expression. She wrote, for example, in defense of former New York Times writer Bari Weiss, after Weiss became the focus of the cancel culture debate when she resigned from the paper after outcry over some of her writings and online statements.

At issue was a statute that makes it a crime to encourage or advise immigrants in the country illegally to stay. Critics say the law could ensnare grandparents, ministers, lawyers and human rights activists.
The other states on Hansen's list, if you're curious, included Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, New Mexico, South Carolina, South Dakota and Utah.
MONTAGNE: NPR's political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thanks very much.
Some lawmakers are outraged by the strategy. A letter sent to Cardinal Health last week by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform said the company doesn't appear to need financial relief.
CASTRO: Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?
Barr originally tapped Durham in 2019, and expected his work to be completed by last summer. But the timeline was pushed back, and Barr said he wanted to make the appointment before the election to ensure he could complete his work without regard to the outcome of the election.
MIKE THOMAS: I just feel like me and people like me deserve to be in this business. You know, I've risked my life for the plant, basically. I've done time for the plant.

Landry says there are three things, in general, that you need to qualify for benefits: First, a medical diagnosis. Second, evidence that the condition affects your ability to work. And third, the disability has to last for a while.

Now, he rails against other countries, doesn't he? He says he's for our workers, but Trump's own products are made in a lot of countries that aren't named America.
It turns out, she's probably right.
The foundation agreed to disclose its donors on an annual basis. It also spun off the Clinton Global Initiative — that annual confab of world leaders — and its HIV/AIDS Initiative into separate, but still related, entities. The foundation also agreed to inform the State Department of any foreign contributions.
SCHUMER: That's a very important and very difficult question. You know, I lived through the Sept. 11 crisis in New York. I lost three friends. This crisis is so different because what New Yorkers and Americans like to do during a time of crisis is come together, but because this - of the nature of this crisis, we have to remain apart. And that means, of course, visiting loved ones who are sick or very ill. It means all kinds of things, you know, that are less severe but very heartbreaking to people - weddings and family celebrations and things like that. And that's something that has to be weighed.
The Trump administration is asking Congress for roughly $1 trillion in new economic relief as lawmakers begin work on the next phase of coronavirus relief efforts.
And by the way, these numbers are what they call outcome-determinative, meaning these numbers far surpass. I lost by a very little bit. These numbers are massive, massive.
Democrats called on Americans to reject what they called the politics of fear and division of the GOP and elect Hillary Clinton during the third day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.
And while Trump will have an unfiltered platform to lay out his agenda, any proposals or promises to reach across the aisle could be undone by a tonal change in a tweet or in unscripted remarks.
SIMON: Income tax, I believe, is that percentage.
Seamus Kenney, a middle school band and chorus teacher from Chapel Hill, will be there. So will his wife, Kerri Lockwood, who teaches elementary school art. Kenney comes from a family of teachers, he told NPR. Falling wages have driven some of his colleagues out of the profession, but others, like himself, are hunkering down and saying, 'No, I'm staying,' and demanding that it be improved.
KELLY: If you just look at the top tax rate that he's proposing...
Trump had previously proposed a payroll tax cut to boost the economy, but both House and Senate Democrats rejected that proposal, arguing it does not provide help to those hit hardest by the pandemic. They said that tax relief is geared too much toward wealthier Americans who aren't feeling the pain as acutely as restaurant, hotel and others in the retail sector.
In addition, Trump came out against the proposed AT&T takeover of Time Warner (parent company of CNN). He also said as president he would have federal antitrust lawyers reconsider their 2011 approval of Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal as part of an assault on media concentration. Such a position is defensible but appears aimed at those owners of media outlets that he sees as providing hostile coverage. Trump has made no such remarks about the Murdochs' twin media empires at News Corp. and 21st Century Fox, for example.
Then Ryan applied some public pressure. We as Republicans have been waiting seven years to do this. We as Republicans, who fought the creation of [Obamacare], and accurately predicted it would not work, ran for office in 2010, in 2012, in 2014, in 2016, on a promise that if given the ability we would repeal and replace this law.
Today you have a very young crown prince who is ambitious who needs to push the envelope ... because demand is changing for oil, technology is changing, he says.
Despite plenty of Black people wanting to farm after the end of slavery, white people worked to prevent them from owning land. Black farmers could be pushed off their lands by force or through tax fraud. Banks were unwilling to lend and farm equipment sellers wouldn't sell to Black farmers.
You know, he went after Bernie Sanders when it came to the health care debate, saying, oh you think that once employers don't have to provide health care or aren't providing health care that they're just going to give those savings back to the employers. You know, you say you're a socialist. You have a lot of faith in the private sector. I'm paraphrasing.
What is art? Well, the answer may be in Rhode Island's tax code. The state offers a sales tax exemption to resident writers, composers and artists who sell what they call original and creative works of art there. What is original and creative?
California Sen. Kamala Harris says she was bent toward a career fighting for civil rights almost since birth.
Why Trump got hit by the AMT in 2005 isn't clear without more details than were included in the two-page return released Tuesday night by journalist David Cay Johnston.
PARKER: I really don't. I mean, I think this was something for the social conservatives in the Republican Party to grasp onto. I mean, you know, how else can Tony Perkins sent out email blasts asking for $5 donations? You have to have something to sink your teeth into. And people probably are...
My view is that it's the right thing to do, but also that it's sound economic policy.
Others argue that $1,000 checks aren't going to fix crumbling supply chains in China or revive our face-to-face service industry in the era of social distancing. Nathaniel Hendren, another economist at Harvard, argues that this money would be better spent directly fighting the virus. Universal $1,000 checks won't get people back to the restaurants, Hendren says. Universal testing will get us back to the restaurants. As for the millions of workers laid off or furloughed, Hendren believes a big expansion of unemployment insurance would be a more direct and less wasteful way to help them.
Under the deal, Manafort agrees to cooperate in any and all matters as to which the government deems the cooperation relevant. That includes testifying fully and completely before a grand jury in Washington, D.C., or elsewhere, according to the plea agreement.

Facebook fares no better in garnering scathing critique of its influence on the political conversation. At its core, it's a platform meant to connect users with people they already like, not to foster discussion with those you might disagree with.
CORNISH: So what's your response to critics of progressive candidates like yourself, where that answer is almost always, it's going to be taxes?
And throughout, Trump highlighted his America First agenda. For example, in terms of legal immigration, Trump wants to end the visa lottery system, limit family reunification policies to spouses and children only and build a great wall along the Southern border, which was a signature campaign promise.

Then there's Trump's tax plan. He would give trillions in tax cuts to big corporations, millionaires, and Wall Street money managers. That would explode our national debt and lead to massive cuts in priorities like education, healthcare, and environmental protection.
FACT CHECK: How Does Paul Ryan's Case For Tax Cuts Match The Facts?
HORSLEY: ...When the stock market had one of its worst days in history. Yesterday, the Dow plunged almost 3,000 points, the biggest point drop ever, the second-biggest percentage drop ever. So far this morning, trading at least has gone smoothly. We have not had to see the kind of temporary halt to trading to let investors catch their breath that we saw yesterday.
When Mark and John were giving me the tour and I was talking to some of the workers along the way and asking them where some of the precision machinery came from that is being used here at Futuramic, what I hear all over the country - Germany, Japan, Italy - I want to bring that precision manufacturing back to the United States. There is no reason we can't begin to make those machines ourselves and supply the rest of the world instead of buying from somewhere else.
Axelrod Says Clinton 'Penchant For Privacy' Made Health Concerns A Bigger Story
ESPUELAS: Yeah. I mean, I think this is the fallacy of polling, which is that if you ask any human being what is the most important thing that they're thinking about, obviously they're going to think about their first needs - jobs, housing, health. And so that's what comes across in polling. But very quickly thereafter, you're going to hit those issues which are emotional markers. And for, I think, Latinos in general, but immigrants in particular - or the other way around - basically, immigration is a proxy for how we are being seen in this society.
POPE: I think Donald Trump will hurt the down-ballot races. That's why I think it's even more important to put efforts into Republican races for the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Congress, as well as for governors in the state legislature.

The most reliable independent estimates of what it would cost to build a wall are somewhere between 25 and $40 billion. Michael Chertoff who was secretary of Homeland Security under George W. Bush has been very opposed to Donald Trump's presidency said to me, look, I think the wall is a ridiculous idea, but it's not logistically impossible.
Without strong union structures in place, educators are winning concessions through grassroots and online organizing. This, Paglayan says, is a fascinating development considering the case now before the Supreme Court that would hobble the power of unions to collect any fees from nonmembers.

The U.S. Supreme Court this week sided with states that want online businesses to collect state sales taxes - used to be if a business sold something online then shipped the merchandise to the customer in a state where the company didn't have a physical presence, the customer was supposed to find out if he or she owed sales tax and then pay it. Well, that often didn't happen. Now, the justices say that collecting that tax for the state is the responsibility of businesses. South Dakota brought this case to court. Attorney General Marty Jackley argued the case and joins us now from Brookings, S.D. Thanks very much for being with us.
House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi has said she wants to push for a vote every week on a resolution that would force disclosure of Trump's tax returns between 2006 and 2015. The resolution, sponsored by Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., has already gone down on party-line votes in the Ways and Means Committee and on the House floor. Senate Democrats have a companion measure.
The bigger question, though, is not what Trump could do to cripple the health law — it's what he would do. He has addressed the issue only rarely — characterizing the health law as, simply, a disaster — and his plans for it aren't clear. It's one thing to talk about ripping insurance from 20 million people who are newly covered, Bagley said. It's another to actually do it.
The owner of one small cellphone accessory shop on the ground floor sits at a desk, enjoying a cup of cardamom-laced Saudi coffee and some dates. The owner, who goes by the name Abu Saud, has three shops in this mall. He says he was a happy man, and business was good, until the Saudi government told him to replace his foreign workers. For years he hired mostly South Asians who are skilled at fixing cellphones.
Even if Trump fails to repeal the law, Frakt says, he could easily destroy it from within by refusing to fund it through the budget process.

For the first time in many years, I would say in decades, it's not clear to us what the president-elect thinks about federal nutrition programs, and they are essential for people facing hunger, says Diana Aviv, CEO of Feeding America, a network of 200 food banks around the country. The Census Bureau says that last year alone, 4.7 million Americans were kept out of poverty by food stamps.
HORSLEY: One thing to keep in mind is that the administration forecast is assuming some positive things - for example, that an infrastructure bill gets passed, that the president's individual tax cuts are made permanent - all that sort of baked into their forecast. On the positive side, they are also assuming that more people come off the sidelines and enter the workforce, that businesses invest more in capital goods and that boosts productivity.

EVANS: Both the House and Senate bills have a framework for throwing out previous marijuana-related offenses, and this has happened to some degree in other states that have legalized. Right now the plans differ on when those records should be expunged and whether they should go away automatically or if people should have to go to court and ask a judge to toss them out. Most experts agree that automating the expungement process helps the largest number of people get a clean slate. But it's also expensive and requires a major technology overhaul in Virginia. The alternative, a petition-based process, ends up being more expensive and time-consuming for individuals.

The transition and the start to the Trump presidency should be great for ratings in the same way the invasion of Iraq was: A strong contingent of the country will cheer it on. Another segment will look on with grave misgivings. And the stakes are enormous. Yet that's just ratings and clicks. If Trump holds to campaign form — which is not certain, but there's no reason to expect otherwise — news organizations will have to choose whether to lurch from outrage to outrage rather than identifying what's actually occurring in the new Trump administration.
SAGAL: Thank you, sir. Take care.
The labor force participation rate measures the share of people 16 and older who either have work or are looking for work. After years of decline, the figure has stabilized in the past year or so. Some of that decline wasn't good — that is, it reflected people getting discouraged and giving up on the job search. However, some of the decline reflects demographic realities — in this case, the fact that baby boomers have started edging into retirement. That's not a bad thing.

Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad. Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they've lived through one international humiliation after another.One after another. We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint. This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absolutely nothing – it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated.

BIDEN: They do not have to buy in.
I could make a lot more money if I didn't have to pay that, he acknowledges. But the greater burden, he says, are the hours of administrative paperwork he has to deal with — and all the confounding choices from insurers. Though he tries to pick a good option, he says, I have no idea if it's a good [health] plan or a bad plan, in comparison to everything else.
He was released from prison again earlier this year, just weeks after Trump signed the First Step Act into law. The criminal justice law, which reduced sentences for certain federal drug crimes, among other provisions, may be Trump's crowning bipartisan achievement from his first two years in office.
ELVING: Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned under pressure. The undersecretary for management resigned. Trump also removed the Secret Service director. Acting is, as you suggest, now the first word in the title for much of the cabinet, too. And that's far from ideal for those officials or for the government. But they also do not have to go before the Senate for confirmation hearings or to answer questions. And that's a trade-off that the president apparently likes.
And that's a big deal because a lot of the problems we're seeing in terms of being able to get shots, not people get shots, is that there's just - there's a lot of miscommunication between the states and the local departments and the hospitals. And that comes from the fact that the states are not sure what they're getting a week from now. So it's hard to make plans. So they're working on all of these things. They're also paying a lot of attention to equity. You know, they're making - you know, it's not just how quickly shots are getting into arms. But are they going into everybody's arms? In particular, are they going to the sort of people who are most at risk? I mean, it's sort of - it's sad. But, you know, in general, higher income groups are doing a much better job of getting shots than lower income groups. But lower income groups, in general, they're the essential workers. They're the ones in overcrowded housing. They're at the greatest risk. So the Biden administration is trying to do something about that.
FOLKENFLIK: Oh, it's like trying to keep hold of an eel or something. I mean, he's very slippery about answering actual questions. There's subterfuge. There's imprecision of language. Sometimes the sentences aren't fully coherent when he's being pinned down on something. Or he just changes gears and talks about something entirely different. All politicians are capable of doing this. But Trump is a master of this, as he is in so many ways, of eluding the press's grasp. I mean, if you think about the fact that Trump has not released his tax returns yet, this is something a presumptive nominee of a major American political party might be expected to do in a presidential race. His earlier financial disclosure forms are all over the map - very amorphous in terms of what they actually reveal. So Trump does not like having the details of his actions and transactions pinned down.
Prosecutors for special counsel Robert Mueller say they take no position on what Paul Manafort's prison sentence should be, but say President Trump's former campaign chairman acted in bold fashion to commit a multitude of crimes.

There truly were 15 years ago differences of policy for which people would say, 'Hey,' for instance, 'Arlen Specter, at what point are you still a Republican?

President Trump has repeatedly attacked state lawmakers' inability to curb the state's homelessness problem, vowing to enlist the federal government to get involved if the crisis does not start turning the corner.
He was angry about this. He missed the competition, says Mukuria, noting that the experience made him want to do something about the issue, especially when it continued to be a problem more than half a century later.
In very broad strokes, the Green New Deal legislation laid out by Ocasio-Cortez and Markey sets goals for some drastic measures to cut carbon emissions across the economy, from electricity generation to transportation to agriculture. In the process, it aims to create jobs and boost the economy.

Facing A Reckoning, Wyoming Wrestles With A Transition From Fossil Fuels
Toward the end of his own speech, Obama tied together all of the big themes of this election: Trump, he said, doesn't adhere to that common creed. Clinton, on the other hand, does, he argued.
That's something Congress, not Palantir, will have to fix.
CASE STUDIES The evolution of our guidance on marches, rallies and public events. In 2010, the NPR News Code of Ethics included a concise, seemingly straightforward rule concerning marches and rallies. It read, in its entirety: NPR journalists may not participate in marches and rallies involving causes or issues that NPR covers, nor should they sign petitions or otherwise lend their name to such causes, or contribute money to them. When satirical newscasters Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert announced they were going to hold a rally on the Mall in Washington, D.C., in October 2010, many employees wondered how the ethics policy applied to the event. The gathering – a mashup of Stewart's Rally to Restore Sanity and Colbert's March to Keep Fear Alive – was clearly satirical. But it wasn't an apolitical comedy show, either. The comedians would use the occasion to extend critiques they often make on their shows, criticisms of our political system, media, and culture. Certainly these are issues that NPR covers. And a bystander who spotted an NPR journalist cheering along with the comedians' barbs at various news subjects could fairly assume that the journalist shared the comedians' views, undermining our impartiality. So memos went out reminding staff of the ethics policy, and clarifying that it did apply to the Stewart/Colbert event.
FAUCI: He does now. I mean, I believe, in fairness to him, what he was doing when we were talking about vaccine, he was saying that we were going into trial really soon - within a matter of - at that time, it was like two to three months. Now it's down to about four to five weeks. That's different from getting a vaccine available to deploy, and he does understand that now.
Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Saturday accused Democrats of exploit[ing] the crisis by jamming through unrelated liberal policies they couldn't pass honestly. Among other criticisms, he said it does not include not enough money for vaccinations and ignores the science on reopening schools.
Real Estate Firm With Ties To Trump May Build The New FBI Headquarters

This is the essence of secular stagnation, Hansen said, sick recoveries which die in their infancy and depressions which feed on themselves and leave a hard and seemingly immovable core of unemployment.
Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, thank you for your time.
I am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans. This will lead to millions of new and really good-paying jobs. The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs, or undermines our ability as a nation to compete.
SYMMES: If I choose not to vote then I feel like that abstaining helps Trump. And there's nothing about me that wants to help Trump.
SANDERS: ...Say it was - no, I didn't say it was a good compromise. What I said is that - on the floor of the House when I voted for that, I knew it was a bad bill, but I made a promise to the people of the state of Vermont that I would vote to ban assault weapons. I ran for the United States Congress on that. And it would have been totally hypocritical of me to suddenly not vote for that legislation as bad as it was.
TOLSON: I think that there's a overanalysis (laughter) of all of that and that he...
Mr. TAYLOR: I don't think anyone will talk about me next year.
Shaken By Protests ... And The Pandemic
ELVING: Well, you know, it seemed like there was Mueller news pretty much every day this week, Scott. On Friday, we learned that Trump's chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, has been subpoenaed in the Mueller probe. Now, this is a man who has the keys to the kingdom, if anyone does. We also got a list of 35 witnesses who are expected to be called in the trial of Paul Manafort. Now, that's Trump's 2016 campaign manager. He is accused of money laundering and deceiving the U.S. government. That trial was delayed until next week. But we do expect this is going to be the new refocusing of the Mueller probe in the days ahead.
So I think initially there may have been dissatisfaction, but there was no active opposition. That changed about five or 10 years ago when people began advocating that pastors advocate on behalf of particular candidates from the pulpit. And that job has been going on for a number of years with more and more pastors doing it.

By having so much real data about the real economic life of cities, Louail and Lenormand could ask what would happen if things were different.

They will significantly expand the pace and intensity of deportations. They will seek to, if not formally remove the United States from the Paris climate agreement, then they will be able to take steps that basically undermine it so they can make sure the United States is not enforcing restrictions on carbon output. They can restrict funding and so on. So they can do things right away with the stroke of a pen that would pretty significantly undermine the legacy of the Obama presidency.
Ashenfelter is an economist at Princeton University, and he has spent a couple of decades studying McDonald's. Back in 2012, when he was president of the American Economic Association, he even dedicated part of his big presidential address to the company. And it wasn't just because, as he told us, his favorite meal is fries, a chocolate shake and a Big Mac. He views McDonald's as a kind of natural laboratory to compare and contrast different labor markets. I mean, think about it: Each McDonald's restaurant is pretty much the same. The workers have almost identical jobs, regardless of which part of the world they're in; the food they make is generally the same; and McDonald's restaurants are basically everywhere.

Now, I'm guessing we won't agree on health care anytime soon. But there should be other ways both parties can improve economic security. Say a hardworking American loses his job – we shouldn't just make sure he can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that's ready to hire him. If that new job doesn't pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills. And even if he's going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him. That's the way we make the new economy work better for everyone.
Even the most generous plans often had lifetime maximum coverage limits of a few million dollars before the health law passed, and some plans also imposed annual coverage limits. The health law eliminated those dollar coverage limits.
You know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago. Before being elected President, Mr. Trump was one of the most successful businessmen in the world with a responsibility to his company, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required. That being said, Mr. Trump paid $38 million dollars even after taking into account large scale depreciation for construction, on an income of more than $150 million dollars, as well as paying tens of millions of dollars in other taxes such as sales and excise taxes and employment taxes and this illegally published return proves just that. Despite this substantial income figure and tax paid, it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns. The dishonest media can continue to make this part of their agenda, while the President will focus on his, which includes tax reform that will benefit all Americans.
Mr. McALLISTER: First it goes to honor, education, activism. If we can debate with honor, and we can be more educated on the issues and we can stay active, the conservative movement can have a rightful place in America. I think we can take back seats as Republicans and as conservatives. And furthermore, I think that we can start going to some of these minority areas and to start going into these urban areas and saying, look, we have solutions to offer. Let's have an honest debate about this.
On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants: Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and my friend Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so greatly. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more, nothing even close I have to tell you, than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our borders which we can solve. We have to solve it.
On abolishing the death penalty at the federal level
GREENE: I want to make sure our listeners understand what you're talking about because - I was mentioning the Affordable Care Act because Republicans had those close votes that failed to repeal and replace. But now in this Senate bill, there is language that would basically end part of the Affordable Care Act.
LEVINE: Big donors can give hundreds of millions of dollars. They can really get into just huge sums of money. And so this year, when you're talking about a mid-term congressional election instead of a presidential election, that money is going to play out across 50 states. It's going to play out across hot Senate races. And it's going to play out in little, mini, pitched battles across House races. And so it has a very different impact than it does in the presidential.

One example of this would be the old advertising strategy shrink it and pink it. This phrase refers to the popular marketing strategy of taking a men's or gender-neutral product, reducing the size of the packaging, and turning the bottle pink to target women, and then charging the same price or more than the comparable product. Although this idea may seem arcane, there is evidence to suggest some manufactures are still doing it.
TOM BEWECK: There definitely was hostility in the Trump administration towards federal workers. And there was also hostility in the Trump administration towards science. And so if you're a federal employee and a science agency, that was the double whammy.
The unreasonableness of Defendants' addition of a citizenship question to the Census is underscored by the lack of any genuine need for the citizenship question, the woefully deficient process that led to it, the mysterious and potentially improper political considerations that motivated the decision and the clear pretext offered to the public, wrote U.S. District Judge George Hazel of Maryland in a 119-page opinion released on April 5.
JENNER: They can, and they will. But, you know, I've described this process - it's like peeling an onion. There's going to be layer after layer after layer of nuance that are - that's only discovered over time and with multiple readings. So those - and those nuances tend to be discovered as you have time to work on the bill. But this is going into law immediately and will take effect on January 1. So there are going to be a lot of things that are not discovered in time and can only be worked out over time.
Steve Calk, a Trump economic adviser, says the loss of the exemption is partially offset by other changes in Trump's plan. He takes issue with the Tax Policy Center's analysis and argues that there will be big tax cuts for middle-income families.

Some in the GOP believed the way to a majority was through a Southern Strategy. It used appeals to fear and white racial grievances, which began a long arc of an American political crackup centering around race and culture.
Perhaps most important, Cato's Cannon says, is not whether Trump could single-handedly undo the health law, but whether he could undermine it enough to force Congress to take action. If Trump were to do just enough to cause the insurance exchanges to fail, he said, that would put pressure on Congress ... to reopen the law.

But privately expressing our political choices at the ballot box doesn't negate our commitment to keeping our opinions to ourselves. This means that public expressions of those choices – such as taking a position in a public political caucus that chooses candidates – can be problematic. And while it may be appropriate for most NPR employees to affiliate with a particular political party when registering to vote, some NPR journalists who are responsible for coverage of politics or government should consider any ramifications of such party affiliation. If you find yourself having to publicly state your political preferences or affiliation as part of the voting process, talk with your supervisor about the issues this raises and how we might resolve them.

Right-leaning economists and think tanks tend to argue that it will cause trading to move to other nations, discourage trades that benefit the overall economy, and fail to raise much money.
Righter's reference was to several local affiliates of Indivisible, an anti-Trump organization. The Indivisible groups filed slips of support for Munoz's legislation ahead of Thursday's floor vote.
DETROW: Rob, thank you very much for this report.
But journalism is at the core of our enterprise. We should weigh the effect of all our actions on its credibility and integrity.
You can also find documentation online: All nonprofit hospitals are required to post financial assistance policies on their websites. They must provide summaries written in plain language and versions translated into foreign languages spoken by significant portions of their communities. Be aware that financial assistance is distinct from paying your full debt off in installments, which is what hospitals sometimes first propose.

There's a time limit on debate in the Senate, and there's no filibuster when the clock runs out.
Donald Trump is trying to clarify a remark that caused some angst in financial circles. He first seemed to suggest that the federal government could renegotiate its debt. He has since walked that back. NPR's Scott Horsley reports.

EVANS: Well, over the last year, we've seen Democrats in Virginia focus on addressing the legacies of racism, and that's in large part due to calls for criminal justice reform during Black Lives Matter protests. It's also driven by Governor Ralph Northam. It's his last year in office, and he's really trying to restore his reputation. And if you'll remember, reporters found a racist photo in his yearbook two years ago. Here's - here he is in his speech last month.
It's obviously disappointing, Bob Brockway, president and COO of Canada Dry Delaware Valley told us. He says bottled water sales have grown, but not nearly enough to offset losses.
Republicans Worry Trump Is Falling Into The Arms Of 'Chuck And Nancy'
Only 15 percent of private-sector and state and local government workers had access to paid family and medical leave in 2017, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' National Compensation Survey. Eighty-eight percent, however, had access to unpaid leave.

CHANG: Well, let's talk about some of those Band-Aids. We got a little more detail today about direct payments that the administration wants to send to people. What can you tell us about those?
Problems on the site surfaced early Tuesday and key services remained inaccessible for most of the day. But according to the IRS, the site was fully functional by evening Eastern time.
I could go on for another hour reading this stuff to you and telling you about it. There's never been anything like it.
There is a big catch in California — the state's upcoming presidential primary is still partially closed. That could cause confusion for independent Sanders supporters, who will have to specifically ask for a separate Democratic ballot.
Prosecutors working for Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller, however, have signaled they are ready to start their case in Virginia on July 25 as planned.
Essentially, what they did was, they said, 'We'll give you a massive cut in the property taxes you have to pay, said Timothy O'Brien, author of TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald.
Federal pandemic relief is sometimes compared to a bridge to help struggling families and businesses get to the other side of the crisis. Now, as Congress weighs adding new planks to that bridge, some are questioning how wide the chasm really is. The House is expected to vote tomorrow on President Biden's $1.9 trillion rescue package. NPR's Scott Horsley reports on one of the more contentious elements in that plan.

He went on to lay out the traditional Republican argument about how the parties aim to balance the budget — Republicans want to cut spending, while Democrats seek more revenue, which means increasing taxes.
Now, there is a debate over whether it was the right thing to do and the merits of the policy. But this is what they promised voters. And this is what they won an election on. And they failed to meet that promise. And there may be consequences for that.
I need you, Biden stressed, calling for Americans to come together in unity of purpose and describing his approach as a putting the country on a war footing to get the job done.
SIMON: Well, at the same time, Representative, were you comfortable with getting rid of the deduction for medical expenses? Because we - a lot of news organizations have been reporting about how hard that would hit a number of families with major medical problems.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #8: Mr. President, what's your reaction to George Papadopoulos's guilty plea?

Despite the huge numbers of infected people, Italy's 24-hour rise of 3,500 new cases is the slowest rate of increase the country has seen in weeks.
ELVING: You know, every once in a while.
This is going to be the biggest tax cut and the largest tax reform in the history of our country, Trump's Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said at a panel Wednesday morning.
This is our New American Moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American dream, the president will also say.
You have 27 million children in our country who do not get the full maximum amount [of the tax credit] because their parents do not make enough money, says Chuck Marr, the center's director of federal tax policy, in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition.
So let's carry that message all across America. Let's fight hard and win in November. And then let's get to work delivering results for the American people. We are stronger together. Thank you all so much.
Texas doesn't give families an extra break on their income taxes when they contribute to a 529 because Texas doesn't have an income tax.
Most Americans send their kids to public schools. And there's little concern that this change will drive many of them into private schools, since using a 529 to save for the early grades just doesn't make a lot of sense. For early grades, the funds simply don't have enough time to grow — except for high-income savers who can afford to set aside a lot of money from the get-go.
Yentel thinks it's a reflection of the severity of the problem. Rents around the country have been rising faster than wages and almost half of all renters now have to spend more than 30% of their incomes on housing. About 11 million of those households spend more than 50% of their incomes on rent. Low-income families feel the most pain, but the problem has also started to creep up into the middle class.
The meeting ventured into other topics besides infrastructure, according to a Democratic aide. The president brought up trade and immigration, calling the U.S. border with Mexico a disaster and asking Democrats to work with him to address the situation there. Pelosi said Democrats wanted to work on comprehensive immigration policy change.
I have no patience for injustice. No tolerance for government incompetence of which there is so much, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens. When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or still worse, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the other way. And I won't look the other way.
ORDOÑEZ: Well, it was a somber scene, you know. I mean, this is the last day of the administration. I mean, throughout the White House today, you know, there are people saying goodbyes, taking pictures. There's a lot of tears. There's bare walls with no pictures on them. So when President Trump came out, there was a lot of anticipation about whether he would talk. And it was interesting that he didn't come out in ways that he - you know, he often would in the past. He actually stood a few steps back away from, you know, the press and answered questions - and did not answer questions, excuse me, and just thanked the press, thanked supporters and said it was an honor to do this.
Schwarzenegger responded in a video on Twitter with a provocative proposal:
DETROW: So those are obviously big and really important ifs. But if they do happen, can you walk us through what the next few months could look like?
Singh's family has paid off her fall tuition and half of her spring tuition so far. She still owes $16,565.
They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible, terrible crimes.
ZARROLI: And that's only the initial impact of the shutdown. Macroeconomic Advisers founder Joel Prakken says sooner or later, the suspension of so many government services begins to affect the broader economy. Federal workers process housing loans, pay tax refunds and approve food labels. The fact that they're not doing that now keeps businesses from operating.
Individuals would also get to keep deductions for excessive health care bills, a break that would be expanded for two years to let people write off medical costs that exceed 7.5 percent of their income. Under the deal, graduate students would not be taxed if their university decides to waive tuition costs.
FRANK THOMPSON: So over winter break, I've been campaigning for Bernie, canvassing, putting up signs. Right now, you know, I'm just kind of...
We have 12 years, according to science, if we're going to meet the challenge of the climate crisis. And to do that we have to tackle fossil fuels head-on. And the resolution just doesn't quite get us there, says Nicole Ghio, senior fossil fuel program manager at Friends of the Earth.
President Trump was the better candidate, he says flatly.
At the protest's heart are escalating frustrations with pay and financial support for schools — similar to those that have motivated teachers in several other states to walk out since a showdown in West Virginia ended with a salary bump for educators there. In Colorado, teachers are also mounting protests Thursday and Friday, which have already resulted in the closure of a handful of that state's large school districts.
But if his idea seems like a last-ditch Hail Mary play, he wouldn't disagree.
But the idea behind equal marginal sacrifice is that that 40 cents would be harder to part with for the poor woman than 40 cents would be for the rich woman. A progressive tax system, giving that poorer woman a lower tax rate, tries to balance out that pain.
MARTIN: OK. Omar Green is the CEO and cofounder of wallet.AI. He joined us from San Francisco, California. Omar Green, thank you.
After Wednesday's meeting, while en route to North Dakota for a speech on his call for tax cuts, it was an elated and self-satisfied Republican president, who casually referred to the leaders of the Democratic opposition as Chuck and Nancy, while chatting up reporters in the press cabin of Air Force One.
Congress has subpoena power, which means that something could come out of the investigation that hasn't been in the public domain as yet. So far, there has been some smoke between Trump and Russia, but no fire. And for liberals thinking (hoping) Trump will be impeached because of it, that's highly unlikely. Short of Trump being found to be on the payroll of the Kremlin, don't expect a Republican Congress to impeach a president of its own party.
His biggest personal tragedy was losing the 2002 election, Keri explained. So I daresay there is no connection between the real Soros and the Hungarian campaign production version.
MONTAGNE: Well, thank you very much.
You've got other people in jail in large numbers because they're dealing with mental illness. In fact, jails are probably the major recipients or treaters of mental illness in this country. That is absurd. We ask police officers today to act as psychiatrists, to act - do all kinds of work that really is beyond the training that they have.
Separately, authorities in New York are preparing charges against Manafort for violating state tax laws and other financial crimes, according to reports by Bloomberg News and The New York Times on Friday.
On a recent afternoon on L.A.'s westside, about a half dozen homeless men spread their belongings across picnic tables and on the lawn of a busy park. Nearby, children swarmed a playground. One of the men, 59-year-old Filipe Calderon, says he knows people judge him.
SAGAL: This week, an independent investigation revealed that employees at blank had opened an additional 1.4 million unauthorized accounts.
They're going to have to be accommodated, and they're going to have to find a way, if they want to be effective, to hewn off some of the rough edges, Reed said. But our attitude needs to be one of welcoming, not pushing them away.
They cannot escape it because it is here, Mills said. It is everywhere.
Former FBI agent Mike German says accountability is a start, but intelligence agencies won't be able to invent their way out of the data mining problem. German, who is now with the ACLU, says the rules governing private information need to be beefed up.
The section only got written into the statute because of Republicans Rep. Jamie Grant and Sen. Jeff Brandes, in addition to a push from Democrats, Meade said.
His eyes were glazed over and he was muttering to himself, Peace says. That was the point at which I went 'OK, this is really a safety issue. This is somebody who potentially has mental illness — potentially has a substance abuse problem.'
Musk is known for his bombast — tweets that move stock prices and promotions like shooting a car into space.
CENSKY: Yeah, absolutely. I think that the 2020 election will ultimately have a great amount of impact on how accessible voting remains in Michigan or if it gets harder again.
Your simple participation in some online groups could be seen to indicate that you endorse their views. Consider whether you can accomplish your purposes by just observing a group's activity, rather than becoming a member. If you do join, be clear that you've done so to seek information or story ideas. And if you friend or join a group representing one side of an issue, do so for groups representing other viewpoints.
And then when the first debate started up again this year, a couple listeners remembered it, and they said, hey, are you still doing debate dogs? And I was, like, you're right. We are still doing debate dogs. So every debate night, I encourage people to tweet pictures of their dog watching the debate on TV with the hashtag #debatedogs. I retweet as many as I can when I am, of course, not working very hard focusing on my day job. But...
Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, setting us back in Latin America. That's why we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and commerce, and positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people. You want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere? Recognize that the Cold War is over. Lift the embargo.
JERRY NADLER: We've talked for a long time about approaching a constitutional crisis. We are now in it.
What we do know is that Torstar is looking at diversifying the revenue model of how we fund and pay for reporters, columnists, and editorial staff, he said.

MITCH MCCONNELL: Because these are not ordinary times. This is not an ordinary situation, and so it requires extraordinary measures.
I said, But why don't they make it four or five points? Because then people vote. But when you're down 17, they say, Hey, I'm not going to waste my time. I love the president, but there's no way.
Yet the farmers are not a monolith, as Sanap's case shows.
Northwell said in a statement that after KHN contacted it about Singh's case, Northwell dispatched a caseworker to contact her. Singh says the caseworker helped Singh enroll in Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for low-income people. Foreign students are not generally eligible for Medicaid, but in New York they can get coverage for emergency services. With the addition of Medicaid's coverage, Singh should end up paying nothing if the stay is retroactively approved, Northwell said.
Clark is leased to a company called Chief Oil and Gas. The company gets gas it needs, and Clark gets paid. But he knows other people with similar gas wells are striking out.
I'll tell you, I have a message to those who bid today, there were only three. But here's the message: 'You will never ever drill in the Arctic Refuge. We'll stop you.'
DETROW: And that is #debatedogs. This actually started in 2016 during the general election debate. Sam Sanders and I - just at one point, when they were really grim and really toxic, we were just, like, hey, everybody. Just tweet a picture - if your dog is watching the debate, tweet us a picture of your dog watching the debate. And people did that.
GERRI KING: I think he's asked himself that question.
AHLUWALIA: Look. First thing is President Trump has done a tremendous job in one year. You have to give that and recognize that. And then at the same time, we have seen the Democrats time and again try to push him back and try to obstruct every aspect of things which he wants to and the Republicans. So people who are in the Washington, D.C., area are very smart. They see a doer and person who's looking to solve things and make their life better. You saw the tax break, which they will see and start reflecting in their paychecks. And you saw how Apple gave a huge bonus to that.
U.S. markets fell sharply Monday amid widening concern that the continuing spread of cases could lead to a global pandemic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled nearly 1032 points, or 3.56% All of the major market indexes were down more than 3%.
KELLY: The deal in question would have designated Guatemala as a safe third country, making Hondurans and Salvadorans apply for asylum there instead of here in the U.S. Do we know, Carrie, if there was such a deal?
But that application is still pending. The Commerce Department has said the review process should take roughly 90 days and it will consider requests for exclusions of certain products determined not to be produced in the United States in a sufficient and reasonably available amount.
A significant clue comes from the American Federation for Children, the advocacy organization DeVos chaired until she was nominated. AFC supports both publicly funded charter schools and even more so, private school choice — publicly sponsored programs that give families money to spend on tuition at private schools.
The Nuclear Energy Institute has asked the Trump administration to temporarily waive fees for nuclear power plants. The trade group also asked for grants from the Energy Department to pay for COVID-19-related leave for those working on the Vogtle nuclear power plants under construction in Georgia.
Like Pasciuto, Acemoglu would like to see incentives for hiring and training.
So maybe it makes sense that Americans think all that work they put into filling out their forms ends up doing the lion's share of funding the government.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is set to receive $7.5 billion to track, administer and distribute COVID-19 vaccines. Another $46 billion will go toward diagnosing and tracing coronavirus infections, and $2 billion will go toward buying and distributing various testing supplies and personal protective equipment.
By the end of the week, we will be finished with the budget resolution, which will be about reconciliation, if needed, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters last week. I hope we don't need it. But if we need it, we will have it.
If fewer insurers add the CSR load to silver plans sold off the exchange, those plans may be more affordable next year than they were in 2018.
GROSS: Evan Osnos is a staff writer for The New Yorker. He spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies. The article they discussed in The New Yorker is titled President Trump's First Term.
Another round of stimulus checks: The latest round of direct payments would send $1,400 per person for people earning up to $75,000 and couples earning $150,000. The payments would be reduced for individuals earning over that amount but under $100,000 or more per year. The legislation also includes an additional $1,400 per dependent regardless of age.
Jackson found Manafort broke the agreement after he lied about his interactions with Konstantin Kilimnik, who has also been indicted by the special counsel and whom the FBI believes has ties to Russian intelligence. Authorities said Manafort was also untruthful in response to questions about his finances and his contacts with members of the Trump administration. Manafort's attorneys say he did not intentionally give false information.
Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries. No longer will we enter into these massive transactions, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long – and which no one from our country even reads or understands.
Club For Growth Action spent $1 million advertising in Iowa, $1.5 million in South Carolina, and $1 million in Oklahoma and Arkansas. Sachtleben said the ads helped to drive Trump's poll numbers below Ted Cruz's in Iowa and Oklahoma, and helped to narrow his winning margins in South Carolina and Arkansas.
Democrats spent hours on Thursday reading stories from their constituents about how the Affordable Care Act helped them, and tried to make the case that Price is a threat to Medicare, Medicaid and health care for people who have ongoing medical conditions.
Darren Arnold lights the burners on a natural gas stove at a testing facility near Portland, Ore. He's using a new, lower-carbon gas mixture for NW Natural, a gas utility that serves 770,000 customers across the region.
DE SOUZA: Yes, it's mixing feelings, you know, frustration, stress, anxiety from my family, myself because I think the government - the Democrats and Republicans - they still do not have anything set up, planned, for people that, you know, came to the United States in the legal path. So we talk a lot about illegal immigrants, and we have the rights to talk about them, and they have their own stories. But I don't see much, you know, people address this issue because, you know, think about it. I came by invitation to the United States. I play sports here. I was a scholarship athlete here. Then, you know, passing 12 years, I'm still jumping from visa to visa to visa.
These figures started to decline at the end of the Obama presidency and further nosedived under Trump, who stoked racial divisions.

Second, the Department of Health and Human Services gave grants to the hot spots around the country where most new infections happen so that those places could begin to create locally customized plans for ending the epidemic. Now that the first year of funding has come through, the hope is that those places can hit the ground running. — Selena Simmons-Duffin, health policy reporter
The average yearly number of these disasters, ranging from hurricanes to wildfires to prolonged heat waves, has quadrupled in the last three decades, NPR's Rebecca Hersher and Lauren Sommer report.

His response to Hurricane Harvey had its odd moments — calling out crowd size and wondering publicly about how the recovery efforts would be viewed in five or 10 years. But so far, local officials have praised his administration's response to help the recovery. It's still very early to know how well it will be handled long term, as the waters in Texas are only starting to recede.
TREVOR ROBINSON: For those who are afraid that this tax would result in losing your jobs, your fear is absolutely valid. And when Amazon has that much power over you, we have a very serious systemic problem.
MOORE: I like the Trump tax plan. I wouldn't have helped him if I didn't feel like he wanted to go in the right direction. When Larry Kudlow and I met with Mr. Trump, he and I basically said, we like the direction you want to go. We want to kind of refine it for you. And he said, I'm open to the suggestions.
That's where the CASE Act comes in. When Congress passed the massive stimulus bill in late December, it was — like lots of legislation — packed to the gills with stuff that had nothing to do with government funding. Tucked among tax breaks for various industries were a few provisions intended to counter online piracy, including the CASE Act, standing for Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement. Sound dull? Read on.

Punjab is a rich agricultural area, long known as the breadbasket of India. It has about 3% of India's arable land but grows nearly 20% of the country's wheat and 12% of its rice. It was ground zero for India's Green Revolution, and it's where farmers have benefitted most from the status quo.

Christina Simeone, a doctoral student at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, has studied the nuclear issue at the University of Pennsylvania's Kleinman Center for Energy Policy. She called it unfortunate the House and Senate bills are so similar, and thinks the true fix is a market-wide price on carbon — which means power plants would have to pay for the pollution they emit.
And they already have a backlog of more than 400 asylum-seekers. More than half of those applicants are from last year, which cases still haven't been resolved. But yesterday, President Trump was very pleased with the agreement. All weekend, he'd been berating the Guatemalan president. But yesterday, Trump said Morales is now a friend of the U.S. instead of being an enemy.
BEARDSLEY: Yes, it's degenerated. Actually, it's a strange city today. I was just in Saint-Germain-des-Pres, where people were sitting at cafes and shopping. But now I'm at Place de la Republique where the yellow vest protest march ended. And the police are here. And I think they were trying to keep them from taking over the square.
HORSLEY: Right. We don't know all the details, but we do know there are various measures included to help struggling industries, including airlines, for example. Airlines say they've seen a bigger drop in traffic from the coronavirus than they did after 9/11. They were among the first businesses in the country to really feel the effects. Now, of course, that pain is spreading to a lot of smaller businesses. So the plan also includes some support for them. And then maybe the centerpiece of this is just direct payments to individuals. So many people have had their hours cut back or been laid off, so the package includes money directly to go to the hands of Americans.
Things like, 'Oh, I thought we were gonna blow ourselves up in nuclear war, but it didn't happen. And therefore, just be quiet and have some babies, and, see, everything will be all right,'  she says.

More Democratic representatives are moving to support an impeachment inquiry. NPR's Susan Davis talks to Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., about why he is now calling for an impeachment inquiry.
Accustomed to strong central direction and a command economy, the Center found it difficult to fathom how the United States could achieve such high levels of economic production and technological innovation with so little apparent regulation. The gap in its understanding of what made the United States tick tended to be filled by conspiracy theory. The diplomat and later defector, Arkadi Shevchenko noted of his Soviet colleagues: Many are inclined to the fantastic notion that there must be a secret control center somewhere in the United States. They themselves, after all, are used to a system ruled by a small group working in secrecy in one place ... However much the Center learned about the West, it never truly understood it. Worse still, it thought it did.
In Louisiana, casinos are prohibited from making campaign contributions to state politicians or campaigns. But casinos can donate money to federal groups such as the Democratic and Republican governors associations. And these outside groups can spend freely on state races.
The GOP, in the partial repeal bill that passed in January and was vetoed by President Obama, proposed to cancel the tax increases in the health law, as well as the health premium subsidies and Medicaid expansion. But it would have kept the Medicare and Medicaid payment reductions. Because the benefits that would be repealed cost more than the revenue being lost through the repeal of the taxes, the result would have been net savings to the federal government — to the tune of about $317.5 billion over 10 years, said CBO.
INSKEEP: And it does point to the way these things sort of work. When you campaign against the elites and get them out of power, you tend to bring in your own elites. But how did he end up connected with Donald Trump?
Hillary Clinton got side-eyed after blasting Jennifer Lopez's Let's Get Loud at a campaign stop in San Antonio where she called herself La Hillary and Tu Hillary. Jeb Bush earned eye rolls after debuting a Spanish-language ad celebrating Cinco de Mayo.

KAHN: It's unclear. We asked for clarification of the tweet and comments from the White House, but we didn't hear anything back. Secretary of State Pompeo did just get back to Washington after a trip through Latin America with stops in Mexico and El Salvador. He praised both of those countries' progress on curbing migration, so it appears that President Trump has now turned his attention and his threats to Guatemala.
So, this is an opportunity for me as an African-American conservative to have a platform to say, look, let's talk about the right things that we need to take America from, and let's not let the message get to a point where it promotes hatred, versus healthy debate within America, and an embracing of American values.

It's unclear whether Trump is negotiating for additional changes now, as he looks to close the deal with House conservatives before Thursday's vote, or whether any changes would come in the Senate, which would take up the House bill once it passes, if it passes.
Harris here takes a page from Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who recently announced a moratorium on the death penalty in his state, saying it was a personal and moral issue for him.

Big tech is now coming into their own. We beat them four years ago. We surprised them. We took them by surprise and this year they rigged an election. They rigged it like they've never rigged an election before. And by the way, last night they didn't do a bad job either if you notice.
DETROW: So he didn't say anything about the Trump Foundation or what Attorney General Schneiderman is doing, but he did talk at length about taxes. Trump did not directly deny the story. In fact he said fixing the broken tax code is a main reason why he's running for president, that he understands the tax code himself, and he's taken advantage of it.
Many workers cite frustration and stagnation as reasons for abandoning traditional, permanent positions. Many of them love the flexibility that such jobs offered. Some make close to $250,000 a year; others, $11 an hour. Those without benefits say they prayed not to get sick and feel stress over planning for retirement. Here are some of the workers NPR spoke to, in their own voices:
About 90% of all of Sublette County's budget comes from taxes on fossil fuels. And he wishes the new administration would have signaled a willingness for more dialogue and a slow 'winding down' of drilling. Instead, he says, the new leasing moratorium was handed down in the first few days after President Biden took office.

It's really disheartening to watch how many people are putting the debt second to their desire for big tax cuts when what we need to do is reform the tax code, said Maya MacGuineas, who runs the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group. If we have a tax cut right now at a time when the economy doesn't need stimulus and our debt is at near record levels, that will do a lot of damage for the economy and it will be a huge missed opportunity.
It was a low blow. I felt very used and very kicked to the curb.
KING: This is a developing story. And reporter Michael Sullivan in Thailand is following it. Hey, Michael.
KURTZLEBEN: Right, and to add in there - it just hasn't served Clinton or Trump to really attack Sanders yet. Clinton wants his supporters eventually, and Donald Trump has an interest in boosting him to prolong the Democratic race.
Tom Vilsack, the former Democratic Iowa governor and USDA secretary under President Obama, says what's often lost in the conversation is that without the federal government, many isolated, rural communities couldn't exist today.
Wave Of Capitalist Optimism Sweeps Across Paris
If 90 percent of your GDP, 80 percent of your exports, 60 percent of your fiscal revenues is from one source, it's going to take you a decade or more to make significant transformation, he says.
That's a concern for Charise Genas of Boston, who was at a candidate forum in Washington, D.C., this week sponsored by the Poor People's Campaign.
But it's complicated — and some of Democrats' priorities might not qualify under this process. So what is reconciliation, how does it work, and what are the challenges? We explain:
BOWMAN: Now, there's no sense where the drones came from. But speculation is they were from Syrian government militias which were operating about a half-hour away. But obviously there's great worry now that this is a new and possibly growing threat to U.S. troops.
Ellis concluded that Manafort's ability to prepare for trial trumps his personal comfort. He instructed the U.S. Marshals Service to move Manafort to Alexandria, as he initially planned.
A spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons refused to confirm or deny that any inmates at federal facilities have received stimulus payment debit cards from the IRS.
I was really surprised because from the outside, it looks like we have plenty of money, she says. But then when you really look underneath it all, you see that people are working overtime. They're working second jobs and even third jobs to try to put together the money just to stay in the middle class where they've been in the past.
Everybody wants to think that their new job is going to be great and their new boss that hired you is going to be genuine, Wilkenfeld said. There's a psychological impediment to saying, 'Hey, Brand New Boss, you've made some promises, can you put them in writing?' Unfortunately, the new boss probably knows that. That's why they make promises in writing that they're willing to commit to, and verbally ones that they're not sure of or can't commit to.
The Vera Institute's report documents that there are almost 12 million admissions to local jails each year, representing about 9 million people. Most of those jailed, she says, are being held for low-level offenses, such as drug misdemeanors, traffic offenses or nonviolent property crimes. And, she adds, the majority are poor.
It's worth remembering that McDonald's was also at the center of the famous study by David Card and Alan Krueger that revolutionized economic thinking about the minimum wage. Card and Krueger found no evidence that New Jersey's hike of the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.05 an hour reduced employment at fast-food restaurants there. Would the same happen in the entire nation if the federal government raised it from $7.25 to $15? Last week, the Congressional Budget Office, while saying a $15 minimum wage would reduce poverty, cast doubt on the idea that there would be no substantial job losses.
HASSETT: Yeah. So think about it this way; the current CBO forecast over the next 10 years is that GDP is going to be about $7 trillion higher cumulatively, I think, in part because of all of the policy changes. And so the deficit is a trillion dollars higher, but I'm asking, is that a trade that you would take? So suppose that you're a pessimist about the deficit. Should you trade a trillion-dollar deficit for $7 trillion more in GDP? Would you trade it for having 5 million people get lifted off of food stamps, you know, for wage growth in the bottom decile, north of 6 percent? You know, I think that the policies are really working to improve Americans' lives.
5. If nothing is going to happen right away, why is this such a big deal?
And so one thing I've tried to focus with my own children is obviously encourage them to do well but not in any way exhibit any pressure towards a military career. And I hope that one of them chooses it. But I hope it would be out of their own desire rather than the pressures that - look; I love my parents, but it was sort of a thing that was kind of expected in those days. And obviously I'd like to have my children be - make more of a choice on their own initiative rather than what they might think I would want them to do.
The trial is expected to last into next year.
Trump went on the attack on the top election issue of health care, labeling Democrats who support universal health care socialists.
Schumer said the group would meet again in three weeks to get the president's funding ideas.
For a nonbinding resolution with an uncertain future, the Green New Deal is getting a lot of attention, along with a decidedly mixed reaction.
Sixty-six thousand votes, each one of these is far more than we need. Sixty-six thousand votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.
When child poverty is compared across wealthy countries and before taking into account government assistance programs, he says, there's not that much difference between child poverty in the U.S. and child poverty in the well-off nations.
Without financial support from the federal government, premiums may increase.
In other student debt news, the Education Department suggested in a court filing that some nonprofit and public sector workers who signed up to have their loans erased after a decade of public service and on-time payments may not be approved for the program after all.
If we can do a better job enforcing the special enrollment, we think we can reduce the premiums by potentially 6 percent to 10 percent, he says.
Instead of shipping profits and jobs overseas. We have got the greatest country and the greatest economy in the world — let's start acting like it, and let's make it clear that the companies have to be part of that greatness.
Roberts wrote in a 5-4 ruling that the requirement for most Americans to either have insurance or pay a fine constitutes a tax — even though Democrats had gone to great lengths to not call it a tax — and was therefore constitutional.
NPR's Audie Cornish talks to political commentators, E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and Brookings Institution and David Brooks of The New York Times. They discuss Trump's speech to Congress.
[The number of Americans in poverty grew by 6.8 million from 2008, the year before Obama took office, through 2014, the latest year of data available. The poverty rate (a better measure here, though it's still very flawed) is up by 1.6 percentage points, to 14.8 percent, though it is down from a high of 15.1 in 2010. Numbers aside, though, it's hard to blame President Obama for all these increases — for example, poverty was already rising when he took office. — Danielle Kurtzleben]
Republicans Wonder How, And If, They Can Pull The Party Back Together
CARY: When he was saying he got praise - I noticed at the beginning, there was praise from the mayor and the governor saying that they were all working together and things were good. But then the optics, as you're saying, did not match that. So at first, there was some praise. But that seems to have stopped as of, you know, last night and this morning. So that's - it makes him look a little more in tune now because it's - he knows the tide's turning.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: When we declare our schools to be gun-free zones, it just puts our students in far more danger.
His arguments sound pretty persuasive in the classroom. At home, it was a different matter.
SIMON: That story is part of a reporting partnership between NPR, KQED and Kaiser Health News.
President Trump comes from a different world, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told reporters. Out in the business community, he likes things done fast, and he's going to continue to push them.
GREENE: He is the former speaker of the House.
Bill Erdle, 65, Oregon City, Ore., HR Consultant
GALSTON: I agree with that somewhat, but I disagree because the legislation that's been proposed so far has been very narrow. It only permits charities to make political commentary or advocate on behalf of a candidate in the course of carrying on their ordinary charitable activities and only if it doesn't involve an expenditure of funds or only a minimal expenditure.
The House gave its final approval on Wednesday, after the Senate made changes to the original bill — some to satisfy Senate budget rules and others to gain the support of moderate Democrats.
Another student asks: What happens if that kid you decided not to have would have been the person who grew up and essentially cured this?
If the Medicaid buy-in bill passes, Blanca and her husband, Hugo, could have health insurance for the first time since they moved to New Mexico 14 years ago. The couple and their oldest son, now 18, are undocumented immigrants from Mexico. (NPR is not using their last names, to protect the family's privacy.) Their two younger children, who were born in the United States, are enrolled in Medicaid.
Opponents of the bill have organized several rallies against it.
Tourism exploded on Mallorca, part of Spain's Balearic Island archipelago, after Juan Carlos began vacationing there as king decades ago. It quickly became a playground for Europe's rich and famous — like a Spanish Monaco.
AKELE PARNELL: At the same time, if you and I are running a marathon and you start five hours ahead of me, you're going to win that race every single time. It doesn't matter what else we do.
Cardinal: Whether it's here at home or across the ocean, children and families have been stranded in their homes. Many have lost everything. Education has been disrupted. Businesses have been closed, destroyed. It will take a long time for people to restart their lives. In some districts in Nepal, for example, 89 percent of the fields were destroyed, which has a huge impact on the agricultural sector and food security.
Not only that, but all of this depends on how much Sanders' plan costs and whether these taxes really would cover the entire cost of the plan. One 2016 report from the Urban Institute found that taxes proposed by Sanders wouldn't fully cover his Medicare for All plan at the time.
To read news stories about the establishment over the decades is to see the group described in the same undefined-but-we-all-know-who-we're-talking-about terms as today.
She said it did not meet the strict requirements of reconciliation, a fast-track process that allows the majority party to pass big-ticket legislation with a simple 51-vote majority.
It's not that the policies themselves are that controversial — at least, not among conservatives. Especially on the right, many would argue in favor of policies like the new tax credit or expensing for businesses.

CHART: How The Republican Tax Overhaul Would Affect You
STEVE GALLARDO: Anyone who doesn't look like them or think like them, they don't want them to vote. They don't care if it's people of color, someone with a disability, someone retired and elderly folk. If they're not looking like them or thinking like them, they're going to continue to introduce bills to keep them from voting, making it more difficult. That's what this is about.
MARTIN: Both parties kind of agree in theory that all these fixes need to get made, yet they can't seem to find the money to invest in them. Why? I mean, in your experience, from your vantage point, what are the stumbling blocks?
A day after dropping more than 1,000 points, the Dow rebounded Friday to close up more than 300 points. But the index lost nearly 5 percent for the week as the markets focused on rising interest rates, inflation and ballooning government debt.
We have no idea right now what they're considering, he said of his Republican colleagues.

And many other public health advocates support the City in its legal battle to keep the beverage tax in place.
HOULAHAN: Well, I think certainly that there are a lot of issues that, I guess, would be considered women's issues, but I would argue are more likely called family issues that, I think, probably would be better served by having a more diverse delegation in Pennsylvania. But similarly - not just gender-based - we ought to have a delegation that includes people with diverse backgrounds and experiences. And relevant in my case, as an example, I'm also a veteran, and I'm also an engineer. And so I think that in our congressional delegation in Pennsylvania right now, it's not just that it's largely men. It's largely men who are either businessmen or who have been kind of successful in climbing the ranks of politics.
And now the game where we ask important people about very unimportant things. Sen. Cory Booker began his public career as mayor of Newark, a city that people said could never come back. But he went there, and he famously repainted the entire city - himself. That got him elected to the U.S. Senate. He joins us now from a terminal at Washington National Airport. Sen. Cory Booker, welcome to WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
Here's Taylor reading an excerpt from it.
One would let individuals who buy insurance deduct its cost, as employers do for coverage they make available to workers. Many health economists argue that the opposite tack — eliminating the employer deduction — would be more beneficial. The employer tax break obscures the cost of health coverage and thereby contributes to health cost inflation. The benefits from the break also tend to accrue to more highly paid people. Under Obamacare, people with low-to-moderate incomes can get a tax credit to help defray the cost of insurance purchased on marketplaces.
HORSLEY: That's right. But it's worth remembering that CPAC was not always this president's crowd or Donald Trump's crowd before he was president. During the 2016 campaign, conservative activists weren't sure what to make of Donald Trump. After he won, though, they embraced him. And they've embraced him even more after this last year. So this was part victory lap, touting successes like the tax cuts and conservative judicial appointments. It was also part pep talk, reminding people that this is an election year, that the president's party typically loses seats in a midterm elections, saying the Democrats are going to be fired up and urging conservatives not to be complacent.
GREENE: Should he be worried? I mean, could this come back to bite him if he has a lot of money and still has this populist message?
When they inaugurated the 600-ton statue last year we all said, 'Wow.' We've never seen anything this big around here, Mena said.
Even though the tax cuts and other changes would reduce Treasury revenue by about $700 billion over the next decade, spending cuts exceed that amount, so the deficit actually goes down by $321 billion, the CBO says.
COURIC: You know, I felt bad for her. She was embarrassed by that interview, so she basically said that they were gotcha questions. And, you know, I think most people, if you watch the whole interview, you can see that the questions were really quite legitimate and fair.
You can get a taste of the discussions, debates and even arguments taking place about the choices in this election at the United Steelworkers union hall in Canton, Ohio.
BENSON: So I don't know what that means, though. What are we rooting for here? I'm not - I'm unclear on that.
There are also concerns that the payments will be based on 2019 income unless taxpayers have already filed their 2020 tax returns and had them accepted by the IRS. That means people who lost jobs or income in 2020 but have not yet filed their taxes might miss out on the full value of the payment for weeks or, possibly, until tax time next year.
Republicans are already working to provide Trump with $12 billion to $15 billion in new spending to fund his call to finish a border wall with Mexico. Congress is expected to use an upcoming defense supplemental spending bill to include new border funds. The supplemental spending bill is considered emergency spending and does not require spending offsets. Ryan and McConnell declined to answer repeated questions about whether the wall would be offset in the federal budget. Trump has insisted Mexico will reimburse the U.S. for the costs, through undetermined new measures affecting trade and tax policy with Mexico.
DAVIES: It's a little confusing when you talk about corporations voting on amendments and voting on legislation. You're talking about a private organization, this council, whose members include state lawmakers from around the country and corporations, and that they work together and develop model legislation, which are then sent back to states and introduced. Those are the votes you're talking about, these internal votes over what kind of legislature - what kind of model-recommended legislation ALEC will come up with?
And here's what he said about one of those bankruptcies: I figured, he said, it was the bank's problem, not mine. What the hell did I care?
After swinging up and down several times, the Dow Jones industrial average ended the day up 330 points, or 1.4 percent, at 24,191. The broader S&P 500 index closed up 38 points, or 1.5 percent, at 2,620 and the Nasdaq finished up 97 points, or 1.4 percent, at 6,874.
There definitely was hostility in the Trump administration towards federal workers, says Tom Bewick, a national program leader at the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. There was also hostility in the Trump administration towards science, and so, if you were a federal employee and a science agency, that was the double whammy.
One major failure in recent years was the GOP effort to overturn the Affordable Care Act. Republicans could not agree on how to repeal and replace the law. They fought for months to try to reach an agreement. Eventually they tried to pass a skinny repeal to buy more time to write a replacement.

Recent high-profile measles outbreaks in the U.S., Europe, the Philippines and Samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year. To prevent outbreaks, the World Health Organization says that roughly 95% of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles. More than half the countries in the world, including the U.S. at 94%, haven't reached that threshold, according to UNICEF. Where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020? Afghanistan, Angola, Bolivia and Haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40%.
Any solution to ensure the sustainability of nuclear facilities should have a fair cost-benefit ratio for consumers and be done with transparency from operators seeking assistance, Abbott wrote in an email.
The health law set limits on how much people can be required to pay in deductibles, copayments or coinsurance every year for covered care they receive from providers in their network. In 2017, the limit is $7,150 for individuals and $14,300 for families.

JOE BIDEN: Folks, there's nothing we've ever failed to do when we set our mind to it. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let's let him know who we are. We choose hope over fear.
Axelrod's suggestion for Clinton was to view the media as a necessary evil.
ROVNER: Yes, we do. Medicare could be cut by billions of dollars. That can be waived by Congress but it takes 60 votes. The Republicans assume the Democrats will come along because they don't want cuts to Medicare, which the Democrats don't. But Democrats are warning that they may play hardball on this and that Republicans should not assume that they're going to vote to waive these cuts which are automatic if the deficit is raised to the extent it would be by this tax bill.
RASCOE: It seemed like the strategy for this one was, yes, to get Trump to maybe notice her (laughter) and strike out at her or - on Twitter, but also trying to make this distinction that, look - Trump is the person we need to go after. And that's always been the question during these campaigns - like, how much do you want to make it about Trump?
Eleven thousand six hundred more ballots and votes were counted, more than there were actual voters. You see that? So you have more votes again than you have voters.
We don't want to bail ourselves out of one economic crisis and one health crisis and go straight into the next one.
SOMMER: Yeah, I mean, it certainly marks a really comprehensive approach to climate change, probably the most comprehensive we've seen from any administration. It's this whole government idea they've been talking about. So it was a really broad range of things they announced. I mean, there's climate change initiatives in the Treasury Department and the National Security Council. It's this idea that climate change really reaches every aspect of our lives. I think the question is whether this administration can cut emissions fast enough because the science shows, you know, the next 10 years are crucial for slowing warming. The goal is to keep it to 1.5 degrees Celsius because even half a degree more of warming means more extreme impacts - things like sea level, storms, fires.
Other strategies include a billboard campaign, Balance What You Eat, Drink & Do, aimed at nudging people to think about the calories they're consuming. The industry is also working with retailers to place lower-calorie options at eye-level, so that consumers may be more likely to notice them.

The governor could be supportive of awarding an incentive such as this, but only after a thorough analysis of a proposed project, said spokesperson Lyndsay Kensinger. HB 1100 proposes 30 years of significant tax credits for a proposal that is currently unknown.
Fresh crises and fresh challenges confront the Trump-appointed CEO of the parent of Voice of America, even with less than two weeks left of the Trump presidency.
I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed, and there's red tape that needs to be cut. But after years of record corporate profits, working families won't get more opportunity or bigger paychecks by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at the expense of everyone else; or by allowing attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered. Food Stamp recipients didn't cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did. Immigrants aren't the reason wages haven't gone up enough; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns. It's sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts. In this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less. The rules should work for them. And this year I plan to lift up the many businesses who've figured out that doing right by their workers ends up being good for their shareholders, their customers, and their communities, so that we can spread those best practices across America.
SIMON: Is the Republican Party offering much of a profile of leadership at the moment? - can't get Repeal and Replace passed, the tax code seems - proposal seems fuzzy, federal response seems to certainly be slow if not negligent in Puerto Rico. We could go on.
But Trump will have his share of supporters for his hard-line approach to immigration as well.
The racial politics of the movement have come under question, including by conservative African-Americans who don't like Obama's policies, but think criticism of him has too often taken on a racist edge. On the other hand, a conservative media watchdog group, the media research center has issued a report this week claiming that it is the Tea Partiers who are being unfairly maligned, especially by the big three television networks as being racially motivated.
MARTIN: How do you make allowances for lawmakers who cannot be physically present to vote on things like a trillion-dollar stimulus package?
Protests continued at airports across the country amid confusion over Trump's travel ban. Immigration attorneys began offering their services pro bono. Late on Saturday, a federal judge issued a stay on the deportations of valid visa holders after they have landed in the U.S. in response to an ACLU lawsuit.
The federal government is advising us it could be 48 hours before test kits can be deployed to restock, the health department said via Twitter.
Some residents I spoke to told me they love the idea of investing in children and expanding preschool education, but they think the city should find another way to pay for it.
Likewise, Trump had said his economic policies could produce 25 million jobs over 10 years. This plan would create up to 2.2 million jobs beyond current projections, the Tax Foundation found, leaving a massive gap between these projections and Trump's goal.

A Look At The Future Of Biden's Climate Change Policies
But, my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task – or any President's – alone. There are a whole lot of folks in this chamber who would like to see more cooperation, a more elevated debate in Washington, but feel trapped by the demands of getting elected. I know; you've told me. And if we want a better politics, it's not enough to just change a Congressman or a Senator or even a President; we have to change the system to reflect our better selves.
JACKLEY: That's right. The sales tax is about 63 percent of our state's general budget. So that's what we used to help on education and other important functions of government. We chose to use the sales tax rather than a state income tax.

President Trump is speaking to a gathering of conservative activists outside our nation's capital this morning. In his remarks, the president again suggested that one of the best ways to prevent mass shootings like the one that happened last week in Parkland, Fla., is to arm some well-trained teachers with guns. NPR's Scott Horsley has been listening to the president's address to the CPAC crowd, and he joins us now. Hey, Scott.

In 1917, the Jones Act granted Puerto Ricans U.S. citizenship, restructured the territory's government and created a bill of rights. It also made it easier for the U.S. to recruit Puerto Ricans to serve in World War I. The 1920 Jones Act restricted shipping to Puerto Rico and was temporarily waived after Hurricane Maria.
During World War II, tax rates for the wealthy soared as high as 94 percent. But poor and middle-class families also paid taxes at rates substantially higher than today's. Despite those high taxes, the vast majority of Americans surveyed by Gallup back then said the taxes they paid were fair.

It could be discussed, Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting. There are a lot of good reasons to do that.
Quigley suggests the inclusion of solar, wind, low-impact hydropower and geothermal sources may not be as good for renewables as it first appears. They are already part of the existing tier 1 requirements. The draft bill duplicates that list in the new tier 3 category, and then adds several qualifying provisions — for example, the energy source may not have received any other kinds of tax credits or payments.

DAVIES: When you wrote about Donald Trump and his policies towards the military and towards foreign affairs, the issue of temperament comes up. This is a loaded word. He hated being criticized for his temperament. But you have - you found a quote from his book Think Like A Billionaire. It can be smart to be shallow, that he has a penchant for making big decisions quickly, that he trusts his gut. Share what - some of what you learned about what that might mean from your conversations with military and intelligence officials.
Third, Wadleigh says he is considering changes that would push more of the cost of emergency room visits to consumers, hoping to deter frequent ER fliers.
HORSLEY: A payroll tax doesn't help tipped workers, who have taken a beating in this mess. And it's also regressive. It gives more money to higher wage earners.

SNELL: That is really the big question that nobody has seemed to be able to answer because it comes down to whether or not the White House is going to intervene here. So far, the attorney general has not changed his tune from several weeks ago when he told our own Carrie Johnson that he would - had no objections to Mueller testifying before Congress. And, you know, they want to try and do that in the next week. And if this continues at pace, it may change the kind of relationship between Democrats and the Justice Department.

Trump invoked the company frequently during his rallies, and it became a key part of his appeal to blue collar voters, promising to stop the hemorrhaging of jobs overseas.
TIMMONS: When I talked to Democrats and Democratic aides in Congress, you know, some of them have quietly said that, we're at a point now where my constituency dislikes Trump so much that if I'm shown to be cooperating in any way, that's going to be bad for me in my next election and bad for me at the polls. So maybe. But they made a political calculation that, no matter what, this thing was going to go forward. And they'd rather just not have their fingerprints on it.
Congress also wants to pass laws affecting federal flood insurance, veterans health care and financial regulations by the end of the year.

First, he said that all travel from Europe to the U.S. would be banned. That is not correct. American citizens are exempt, so are permanent residents and some other groups. And it doesn't apply to all European countries. Then, another crucial mistake - in his address, the president said that the ban would include goods coming from Europe. That is not true. He had to issue a correction in a tweet later, saying trade would not be affected and that the restriction, quote, stops people, not goods.

Seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history. Here are the results. In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power. On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills, and employs more Americans than coal – in jobs that pay better than average. We're taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy – something environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support. Meanwhile, we've cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly sixty percent, and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth.

KHALID: Well, he suggested that he had a sort of natural moral awakening around this pretty controversial program that disproportionately targeted minorities when he was mayor in New York City. In reality, he only publicly denounced the program as he began to think of running for president. And the program itself, actually, was only stopped because of a court order. So it's a bit, to be blunt, of a revisionist history, you know, taking credit for the program being phased out when, in reality, it stopped because of a federal judge ruling the program was unconstitutional.

I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days, Biden said. I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new. Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we all are created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, demonization have long torn us apart.

SNELL: Yeah. With the health care system - is being treated much like the rest of this bill. It's like a life preserver. Everything in this bill as it's been described to me is, they - every member I've talked to, every staffer I've talked to said it's all about keeping things going. And so this includes $100 billion to hospitals and more money into the CDC. There's also more money for community health centers. The goal here, when it comes to hospitals, is making sure that they can free up beds, that they can buy supplies, that they can meet the needs that are expected to begin spiking.
We have a plan for a trillion dollar investment that would create up to 13 million decent-paying jobs.
But underneath that glaring and obvious conclusion, there's a deeper story about how the very DNA of social media platforms and the way people use them has trickled up through our political discourse and affected all of us, almost forcing us to wallow in the divisive waters of our online conversation.

Aument said the state Public Utility Commission puts the cost of his bill between $458.9 million to $551 million annually — amounting to about $1.53 extra per month for a typical residential electric customer. He argues doing nothing would be costlier.

[This Moody's report tried to project the effects of a bundle of Trump's policies together. They projected that employment would grow at first, but then jobs would disappear. Ultimately, they wrote, the U.S. would lose 3.4 million jobs during a Trump presidency under his policies, compared to a 6 million gain under current law. That said, a forecast like this offers false precision, as the Upshot's Neil Irwin pointed out, as it is necessarily uncertain — the assumptions beneath the report, he wrote, involve some guesswork and are at least debatable. (Meaning the same would be true of the assumptions underlying the report on Clinton's policies — see below.) — Danielle Kurtzleben]

American leadership has already dramatically declined in the past ten months. In 1991, when Bush, Sr., launched the war against Iraq, it got thirty-four countries to join the war effort.

Next comes regulatory reform. As with taxes, I will have one overriding goal when it comes to regulation: I want t jobs and I want wealth to stay in America. Motor vehicle manufacturing is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country and even in the world. The U.S. economy today is twenty-five percent smaller than it would have been without the surge of regulations since 1980. It is estimated that current over-regulation is costing our economy as much as $2 trillion dollars a year – that's money taken straight out of cities like Detroit. So many of our cities are suffering so gravely, right out of Detroit and others. The federal register is now over 80,000 pages long.

In other words, that's a nice way of saying this is at the infant stages. Congress still has to write and pass a bill. A tax overhaul hasn't been done in 30 years, and there are plenty of people on Capitol Hill who will want their hands on this.
In the long term, high youth unemployment can lead to loss of skills and human capital. In the short term, youth unemployment shapes the lives of young Italians dramatically. For example, people tend to live with their parents longers – 66.1% of people aged 18-34 still lived with their parents in 2018, while the percentage in United States is roughly 30%. Young Italians struggle to reach financial independence. They have children late, which contributes to Italy having one of the worst fertility rates in the world. And, then they leave, as I did.

Pennsylvania's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) contains two tiers. By 2021, electric utilities must buy eight percent of their overall power from so-called tier 1 renewable energy sources — a list including wind farms, low-impact hydroelectric plants, and methane converted from landfills. A second tier of energy sources – including converted coal waste and larger hydroelectric projects – are to make up 10 percent of energy purchases by the end of the timeline. Solar power is in its own category and tops out at half a percent.
ZARROLI: Oh, it would be immensely complicated. I mean it would take a long time. Unwinding this kind of a - you know, these kinds of businesses takes years.

When tax experts talk about the principles that make for a good tax cut, they'll often mention stability — the idea that taxpayers should be able to accurately predict future federal tax rules when they're making decisions today, said Scott Greenberg, senior analyst at the right-leaning Tax Foundation.
Excellent idea, Rieder says. But no amount of conservation gives you a pass. Oregon State University researchers have calculated the savings from all kinds of conservation measures: driving a hybrid, driving less, recycling, using energy-efficient appliances, windows and light bulbs.

Republican nominee Donald Trump is campaigning in Colorado Monday, following revelations that he would have been able to excuse himself from income tax payments for 18 years.
I think there's a lot more recognition now of something that parents have always known, which is that child care is absolutely essential for society to function. High quality child care is absolutely essential and it's really expensive. A lot of child care providers have gone out of business because they had to lock down last spring and they couldn't afford to go [empty for] a few months. They were already working on very, very tight margins. Parents can't afford to pay more for all these measures they have to put in place, like distancing and sanitizing and Plexiglas barriers and these things, in order to be open in a pandemic. So I think there's recognition that it's needed.

The real benefit, according to the state experts and independent economists NPR interviewed for this story, is for affluent families — many of whom already have kids in private K-12 schools. They can now use their old 529, or open a new one, to help pay that tuition, all while getting a nice state tax break.
President Trump says Guatemala has broken a deal for curbing illegal migration to the U.S., though it is not clear such a deal was ever agreed to. Trump says now he is looking to put a, quote, ban on the country that could include slapping tariffs on Guatemalan goods and taxing money sent back home by Guatemalan citizens working in the U.S. NPR's Carrie Kahn joins me now from Mexico City to talk about this.

MARTIN: Senator Franken has issued an apology, which Tweeden has accepted.
Trump nominated federal appeals court Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the Supreme Court seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. The evening ceremony in the White House's East Room was arranged for suspense, which gave it the aura of a reality TV show in some ways. Conservatives praised his pick, which was a major campaign issue after Senate Republicans refused to take up former President Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, for much of 2016.

MORRIS: There are some complications, though. Kansas City put up millions of dollars to subsidize the USDA's move. The agencies signed a 15-year lease. And lots of the new employees and some of the transfers like being in Kansas City. Forcing them to move back east, would just cause another big disruption. Former official Katherine Evans says the whole move was based on politics, not objective analysis. She's excited about legislation to keep this kind of thing from happening again. It's called the COST of Relocations Act. And Evans says it's a direct response to the forced move of two USDA research agencies across the country.

Not surprisingly, Trump quickly responded on Twitter to Romney's op-ed, asking, is he a Flake? referring to outgoing Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, a prominent GOP critic of Trump. The president said Romney should be happy for all Republicans and should be a TEAM player.
And many of those lawsuits were filed by ordinary Americans who worked for Donald Trump and never got paid. Painters, waiters, plumbers — people who needed the money they earned, and didn't get it — not because Donald Trump couldn't pay, but because he wouldn't pay. Hundreds of liens have been filed against him by contractors, going back decades. And they all tell the same story: I worked for him, I did my job, he wouldn't pay me what he owed me. One person after another after another.

My guest, Jonathan Cohn, is the author of the new book The Ten Year War: Obamacare And The Unfinished Crusade For Universal Coverage. It's about the politics and special interest groups that shaped the Affordable Care Act, the ACA. He writes, figuring out how to fix American health care has never been entirely or even primarily about what kind of system would work best; it's also been about what kind of changes can actually survive the political process. His book focuses on that political process, dating back to the 1920s. He's been reporting on health care since the late '90s. He's a former senior editor at The New Republic and is now senior national correspondent at HuffPost, where he covers politics and policy and has been focusing lately on COVID.

For his part, Biden, who was elected with a diverse coalition, is aiming to take on the issue. We can deliver racial justice, he said in his inaugural speech, and we can make America once again the leading force for good in the world.

BROWN: I don't know yet. We have not made that decision. Before answering any of this, I wanted to just thank you all for doing the burn pit veteran story. We have worked for years - Congress has - generally pretty well when - presumptive eligibility for Agent Orange. And these burn pits, I mean, the government, the military should have known this, just like the chemical companies knew about Agent Orange. And Congress has got to move more quickly on this.

Republicans have been vowing for six years now to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They have voted to do so dozens of times, despite knowing any measures would be vetoed by President Obama.
INSKEEP: In 2016, candidate Donald Trump became the first general election candidate in more than four decades who did not keep a promise to release them. Democrats in Congress have more recently requested his taxes, citing their authority under the law. Although, the White House is resisting. As it's happening, 2020 presidential contenders are putting out several years of their own returns. They include, among others, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and, as of last night, Bernie Sanders and Beto O'Rourke.

SIMON: No, no, I interview pundits. I'm not a pundit. But go ahead, sir.
Job-based medical plans still cover more Americans than any other type, typically with greater benefits and lower out-of-pocket expense. Recent cost increases for this sort of coverage have been a tiny fraction of those for Obamacare plans for individuals.
I think they have to take a look long and hard at what role has their political spending played in sort of the buildup to this crisis, said Bruce Freed, the head of the Center for Political Accountability.
DAVIES: OK, I want to talk about some of the areas of policy that will matter here. And we'll try and figure out, you know, what Trump has said, what he believes, what he is really committed to and what he can actually accomplish by himself and what he needs congressional action for. One thing that people have talked about is that President Obama has done a lot with executive orders because of the gridlock in Congress and that President Trump, once he is inaugurated, can immediately undo a bunch of stuff simply by signing executive orders, repealing President Obama's initiatives. Is that true?
One trillion dollars - that is how much money the Trump administration is asking Congress to give them to fight the economic devastation brought on by the coronavirus.

Now, the one I would take literally is the corporate tax, which we talked about. But the ones I would take seriously are reforming the tax codes.

FENG: Well, they've been way more cautious. And there was way less of pomp and circumstance in the state media coverage of the trade truce.

So this is something where there isn't - outside of the Democratic base, there doesn't seem to be widespread support.

The amount raised is nowhere near what was projected when a Republican-led Congress officially opened the coastal plain to drilling in 2017 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

More than 24 million Americans have contracted COVID-19 and more than 400,000 have died, a number once unthinkable. That number is only climbing. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation projects that more than 566,000 Americans will be dead from the coronavirus by May 1. Even with universal mask-wearing and a rapid vaccine rollout, at least 500,000 are projected to have died by then.

The health insurance offered by big companies is typically pretty comprehensive, the better to attract and keep good employees. But Obamacare broadened some coverage requirements. Under the law, insurers and employers have to cover many preventive services without charging people anything for them. The services that are required with no out-of-pocket payments include dozens of screenings and tests, including mammograms and colonoscopies that are recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force; routine immunizations endorsed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices; and a range of services that are recommended specifically for children and for women by the federal Health Resources and Services Administration.
Proponents of the $50,000 proposal say a more generous policy would target those wealth gaps, especially among Black families. About 80% of borrowers have student debt under $50,000, according to federal data. Advocates of this proposal also argue this level of forgiveness is about racial justice — the dollar amount comes from research that found $50,000 would help grow the wealth of the highest number of Black households. (That research was later updated to reflect growing debt balances.)

MANN: Yeah, this is really controversial. In financial filings, the firms say they plan to declare these opioid payments as losses, which is a deduction, right? It's similar to one anybody might use to pay less in federal taxes. So if they pay $26 billion in opioid settlements, they could recoup as much as 4 billion in tax benefits. And that really angers some lawmakers, including Congressman Jimmy Gomez. He's a Democrat from California. He says these communities need that money.

There is no apparent appetite in either party to raise the gas tax, which funds federal transportation projects and has remained at its current level — 18.4 cents a gallon — since 1993. Democrats have proposed rolling back the tax cuts passed by the president and the last Republican led-Congress to fund road and bridge repairs. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called that idea a non-starter.

JAY INSLEE: People are increasingly sympathetic because they're understanding. They're watching Paradise, Calif., burn to the ground. They're watching the Midwest be inundated by floods. They're watching Miami Beach having to spend taxpayer money building up the roads because of inundation. And it is the reality and the science that is convincing people rather than just rhetoric or ideology. And that is moving very, very dramatically. And this is the existential threat, and it does call for a president to make this job one because if it is not job one, it won't get done. We have to understand, if we don't solve the climate crisis, it will prevent us from dealing with all of our other hopes and challenges.
Nothing — not even policy positions — sit still for long in the 2016 election. This same weekend, Trump clarified his positions on two other major economic policy areas. If you haven't been keeping up, here's a quick recap of Trump's changing statements:
Hillary Clinton says her plan will put a lot of coal companies and coal miners out of business. We will put our coal miners and steel workers back to work. Clinton not only embraces President Obama's job-killing energy restrictions but wants to expand them, including going after oil and natural gas production that employs some 10 million Americans. According to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, the Obama-Clinton energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.
OSNOS: Well, Donald Trump has said himself that he doesn't like to read as a way of getting information. He trusts his - what he describes as his own common sense. That's the term he uses often. He relies on people that he trusts, people that are around him. He does not have a computer. He uses his mobile phone, obviously, for Twitter as we know. But this would be a profound departure from previous presidents in terms of how they get information. I think, you know, Donald Trump tends to want to govern from his gut.

Now, unlike a lot of the men who helped build what would become the Internet, Bob Taylor is not a computer scientist. He doesn't even have a Ph.D. His background was in psychology. And what really inspired Taylor was the idea of expanding human interaction, interaction using computer technology. But to understand how revolutionary Taylor and Licklider's ideas really were, it's helpful to understand the context in which they were formed.
Democrats thought they had unanimous agreement within the party to provide an additional month of benefits and to extend the tax-free status to all people who claimed unemployment last year. But Manchin's objections cropped up at the last minute before a planned Friday afternoon vote, forcing negotiations that dragged into the night.

Revelations about fraud and mismanagement in the Pentagon's retention program emerged after the program's budget swelled between 2000 and 2008 — when the Defense Department went from spending $891 million for selective re-enlistment bonuses to spending $1.4 billion on them, according to a 2010 research paper by the RAND defense institute. By the end of that period, the military was also spending $625 million yearly to pay enlistment bonuses.
Educational institutions can currently apply for an exemption from the nondiscrimination provisions of Title VII by demonstrating that those provisions contradict their religious beliefs, but opinions vary on whether those exemptions will protect Christian colleges that seek to maintain strict student and employee policies relating to sexual orientation.

COHN: Well, you know, in his campaign, he talked about adding a public option. And people who remember the original debate about the Affordable Care Act remember this was a very big part of the original proposal and was a bit of a compromise to please progressives who, remember; for all - historically had always wanted something like, you know, what we call Medicare for All, a single-payer system, the government insuring everybody. Well, that wasn't in the cards politically.
Political experts also have conflicting views about the word and what it represents. Sylvia Manzano of the political opinion research firm Latino Decisions says the term breaks her heart because it seems to be used anytime a candidate engages with a majority Latino audience to discuss issues that are important to it. She says it sets up a damned if you do, damned if you don't trap for politicians who, historically, have ignored Latinos.
Dayton's budget has been slammed by the pandemic, so much so that Whaley isn't sure they will be able to train police officers or firefighters needed to replace front line workers who retire. They are recruiting for classes that would start in April, but if federal funding doesn't come through on time, there will be fewer people on the beat.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics released its jobs report this month, and the numbers, again, are pretty good: the unemployment rate is at 3.6%, while the youth unemployment rate is around 8%. The numbers looked good to us. But to our winter intern, Bianca Giacobone, they seemed astonishingly low. That's because she is from Italy, where the economy has been stuck for decades. So we asked her to write about what it's like to be young and Italian these days.

Various Democratic presidential hopefuls are getting behind an idea long thought to be on the outer edge of progressive politics - so-called Medicare-for-all. Senator Kamala Harris endorsed the idea the other night in a CNN town hall. She also suggested getting rid of all private insurance.
The EY/EIG survey data implicates financial barriers as the culprit of this failure to launch.
I would be very surprised if the United States Congress passed any sort of public child care like the kind that we see in Europe, because there's historically been so much resistance to it. But one thing that there does seem to be growing support for is an idea of a child allowance, which is sending a monthly check to parents. President Biden has proposed this, as have several other Democratic senators. But what's been really interesting recently is that Senator Mitt Romney, who, of course, is a Republican from Utah, has also proposed a version of it that's actually more generous than President Biden's. The idea would be to send between $250 and $350 a month to parents, multiple checks if you have multiple kids up to a certain limit. In Senator Romney's proposal, it wouldn't phase out totally until you made almost half a million dollars a year as a couple. So pretty much every parent in the country would be getting this.
There are only so many things you can do in that bill because of Senate floor rules, reconciliation, Ryan said. You can't put everything you want in that legislation, because if you did it would be filibustered, and you couldn't even bring it up for a vote in the Senate.
But, after weighing their choices, Mark and some other restaurant owners conclude they would accept higher taxes if the government would take over the task of insuring their workers.
The ACA significantly increased average taxes on high-income people mainly through the investment income tax and the Medicare payroll tax. So the top 1 percent and other high earners are the group that would benefit most from the repeal, according to several analyses, including one by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C.
When it comes to taxes paid by the rich, things get complicated.
SHAPIRO: Senator, I'd like to ask about jobs and trade. Your message on trade really struck a nerve in Michigan. When you talk about your proposals to put Americans back to work, you talk a lot about rebuilding roads and bridges. Beyond infrastructure improvements, what is your plan to create American jobs?
I also understand that because it's an election season, expectations for what we'll achieve this year are low. Still, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach you and the other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families. So I hope we can work together this year on bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform, and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse. We just might surprise the cynics again.
BROWN: What most people don't understand is until World War II, most Americans didn't pay federal income taxes. Our entire tax system, including the marginal tax rates, only applied to the richest Americans. In fact, there was a surtax on incomes greater than $5 million. And for three years, in the mid-1930s, it only applied to one man, and his name was John D. Rockefeller.

Then, in 1996, President Bill Clinton signed legislation aimed, he said, at ending welfare as we know it. Pamela Herd, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University, says the bipartisan welfare reform package — which combined benefit cuts, time limits and work requirements for caregivers — was focused on one key policy idea.
The exchange is expected to survive the legislative turmoil, but it still faces the possibility of federal subsidies disappearing under a repeal of the Affordable Care Act.

The House managers in Trump's Senate impeachment trial have already shown clips from the speech, in which Trump outlined a long list of grievances against the news media and against Republicans he deemed were insufficiently supportive, as well as a litany of false claims about how the election had been stolen from him.
[T]he entire north wing lay in ruins, its walls demolished, its roof collapsed. What had been the ground floor was now a mass of rubble. Buried in that tangle of brick, plaster, wood, and metal were dozens of the school's youngest children, along with their teachers. As the reverberations of the blast faded, a muffled chorus of moans, screams, and piteous cries for help began issuing from the debris.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told House lawmakers the administration is considering several ways to help businesses affected by coronavirus-related disruptions.

DETROW: First of all, I think that this was kind of a status quo debate. I don't think anything tonight really shook up the debate or really massively changed any of these candidates' fortunes. I think one really notable thing is that this evening showed that Joe Biden has really affected the conversation about health care. For months and months, Bernie Sanders really set the tone for health care. It was, do you agree with Bernie or disagree with Bernie? And most candidates said that, yeah, I agree with Bernie or at least big chunks of what Bernie's trying to do when it comes to Medicare for All and in some forms of the going away with private health insurance.
Trump actually wants to increase spending on immigration enforcement. In addition to the wall, he has ordered the hiring of 15,000 new Border Patrol and immigration officers and the construction of new detention facilities.
First, let's talk tax reform. Taxes are one of the biggest differences in this race. Hillary Clinton – who has spent her career voting for tax increases – plans another massive job-killing $1.3 trillion-dollar tax increase. Big increase - one of the biggest ever. Her plan would tax many small businesses by almost fifty percent.
A provision making it easier to write off new investments should be particularly helpful, for example. What about a plan to cut the top business tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent? That's probably a plus for investment, Wessel said, but it rewards profits on old investments — not what we should want to do. It is also creating a huge [budget] hole that will have to be filled with tax hikes or spending cuts down the road.

DIONNE: I think the short answer is yes. I mean, President Trump is not wrong to say that China engages in unfair trade practices, and he's not wrong to go after them. But he should not take steps as part of a pressure campaign that may well have higher costs to us than to China, and he should certainly not lie and say that these tariffs will be paid by China. No, as Jim Zarroli's piece just suggested, the tariffs are a regressive tax that at the end of the line usually end up being paid for by consumers. And they could have a negative effect on the economy and create inflation. I still hope he gets a good deal, but so far it doesn't look like he's doing a great job of it.
States generally manage the plans, while the Feds let the money grow long-term, tax-free. Thirty-three states also try to encourage savers with a little short-term reward (or not so little, in some cases): When families in those states make a contribution, they get a deduction or credit on their state income taxes, too.
Trump pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal when he came to the White House. His administration is also working on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement; Trump has, at times, suggested leaving NAFTA altogether.

GROSS: Well, your book is called Character Is Destiny. And of course one of the things that formed your character was being a prisoner of war for 5 1/2 years in Vietnam.

ALLEN: In West Palm Beach, several hundred protesters marched along the Intracoastal Waterway to a bridge just a few hundred yards from Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, including Robert Saplin of Tamarac, Fla.
According to the U.S. Treasury, payments to eligible Americans will continue through the next several weeks on a rolling basis. Most people who are eligible will automatically receive those payments — no action required. The IRS says it will automatically calculate the amount that people receive, based on their latest processed tax return.
OSNOS: Some of the independent analyses of his tax proposal put the impact on deficits to be in a vast range between $4 trillion dollars and $10 trillion dollars. I should say the Trump administration opposed those estimates. They said that they were biased. They said that the economists who'd produced them were sort of - they tried to establish links between those economists and liberal funding sources. At this point, I think it's realistic to expect that if Donald Trump does the things that he has talked about even since Election Day, that those would impose enormous new costs on the federal government.
ROBERTS: And they revealed - yeah - that the president had paid very little in taxes. That led to his I'm not a crook statement. By the way, the reporter who published the returns won the Pulitzer Prize.
JACKLEY: What a safe harbor is is a provision that South Dakota put in its law that says this new law would only apply if there's a $100,000 worth of transactions in a year or 200 separate transactions. So for those small mom and pop businesses, the South Dakota collection requirement wouldn't be in place by statute.
DOUCLEFF: So the CDC thinks that more Americans are traveling to these countries and bringing them home. But then there's another problem here back at home, is that some communities here, the vaccination rates have really dropped significantly in the past few years - below the level needed to protect the whole community. And so once the virus lands here, it has more of a chance of getting a foothold and triggering an outbreak.

For months, Democrats in Washington have been debating what to do about student loan debt. About 43 million borrowers owe $1.6 trillion in federal student loans.

Democratic presidents — as well as occasional Republicans including Richard M. Nixon — have long sought to enact universal health care legislation. President Bill Clinton's failed effort in 1993-94 had taken the issue off the table for over a decade.
MONTANARO: Yeah. There are not going to be huge policy differences between these candidates, but it's going to be one of emphasis.

The fear is so large in many institutions because 40 or 50 or maybe even 60 percent of their budgets are really coming from the federal government, says Dale Kemp, the chief financial officer at Wheaton College in Illinois and the speaker at the CCCU session. To think they could survive without that [funding] would be catastrophic.
And basically, his special interest favor was something that would get health care to the sort of most financially, medically needy people in the country. It was a lot of money. So it was not - it required shuffling things around in the bill. It was not an easy thing to accommodate necessarily. But the end of the day, it was all about getting health care to people who need it, which, of course, was the No. 1 purpose of the legislation. So I think Harry Reid felt, the White House felt, everyone felt like, OK, this is something we can definitely live with.
Through years of acrimony over the relative merits of Obamacare, one kind of health insurance has remained steady, widespread and relatively affordable: Employer-sponsored plans.
HORSLEY: President Trump says he wants to do what works. And he has said both the NRA and Republican lawmakers are in a mood to take some action in response to last week's shooting in Florida. Of course, Trump was elected with strong backing from the NRA. And one of the proposals that he has endorsed is one that the NRA supports, that is, as you say, giving some teachers a green light to carry weapons. Trump says schools need to go on offense as well as defense.
By contrast, the same analyst found that with our plans, the economy would create more than 10 million new jobs.
LOWREY: So in most other rich countries, there tends to be things like child allowances that let you pay for daycare or, you know, things like universal pre-K, which we don't have. There's a huge emphasis on those zero to five proposals among all the Democratic candidates. And that's because childcare is just grotesquely unaffordable for families who are middle income and below and even families who are high income. The Trump administration, for its part, has pushed for childcare to basically be written off on your taxes, which would subsidize the wealthiest families the most but would act as a significant subsidy to all families.
Congress is not ruling out possible legislative action to counter Trump's actions, although party leaders have no immediate plans to act if the president moves forward this week as stated with imposing tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports.

But those projects did happen.

And if things keep going the way they're going now, that's how it's going to be. And I'd like to, you know, as my father said, help the generations going forward.
The position of Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell, hailed for all of his senatorial maneuverability, does not appear so enviable Tuesday morning.

DUTTA-GUPTA: Well, I don't think that the tax credit is less effective if it's not as narrowly tailored. But of course, there's a question if that money going to higher-income households could be better spent elsewhere. That's an open debate and conversation to have. But remember, one of the reasons why I think these policies do have some widespread support is they're fairly easy to administer, in this case through the IRS, and they reach a large share of households. So a lot of people are going to benefit here, and that could help it politically.
ICE is seeking $249 million to convert four facilities into dedicated quarantine facilities along the Southwest border and provide for enhanced sanitation and janitorial services.

This would allow ICE to minimize the risk of further exposure to detainees and prevent transmission within the detention system.

Also critical to our economic renewal will be energy reform. The Obama-Clinton Administration has blocked and destroyed millions of jobs through their anti-energy regulations, while raising the price of electricity for both families and businesses. As a result of recent Obama EPA actions coal-fired power plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions. The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs.
Here's a statistic that is also troublesome, which suggests that we do need to look holistically at this, and that is that 89.6% of American farms today, the income from those farms is not the majority of the money made by the farmers. In other words, farmers have to have ... other income, which represents a majority of what they make for a living. It doesn't come from farming. So I think that statistic suggests that we have to look at ways to create better markets and newer markets and deeper markets. We want diversity and we want diversity across the board.

LIASSON: Historically, when a president's approval rating drops below 50 percent, the party in the White House loses an average of 40 seats in the House. This year, most Republicans in the House have safe seats, says Bolger.
The single most important economic policy in this is health care policy, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday during a webcast with Princeton University. It's getting control of the spread of the virus, which we have not been able to do with much success yet. But it's also developing medical innovations for treatment and ultimately vaccination.
He spent several minutes excoriating the extremely dishonest news media, and mocking TV reporters who said Trump didn't have a chance because of the blue wall of Midwestern industrial states that Clinton was expected to win. We didn't break it, Trump said of the wall, we shattered that sucker.
ELVING: Rich had contributed to the Clinton Presidential Library, which inflamed both Democrats and Republicans. But Clinton did not issue his first pardon until he had been in office nearly two years. President George W. Bush waited longer than that and President Obama still longer yet. President Trump, in his first 17 months in office, has already issued two pardons.
But children, in a kind of cold way of looking at it, are an externality, he says. We as parents, we as family members, we get the good. And the world, the community, pays the cost.

We have an application like Facebook that's really driven by collecting data, and harnessing the value of that data, said Jordan Fischer, a law professor at Drexel University who follows privacy issues. And then we have Apple which is almost becoming this gatekeeper function for applications and saying we're going to mandate a certain minimum level of privacy, and they're clashing because they don't necessary work in the same world.

My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Which is what we have now. Communities want relief. Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness.
The VA would receive the largest chunk of the requested assistance:
There's no question that these personal attacks are designed to undercut our case, and our message, and our efforts, he said. There's no question that a lot of it is politically motivated. It's absurd frankly, it's malicious, it has nothing to do with the case.
After these tax cuts, Kansas had $600 million less revenue than before. So, to balance the budget, the government tapped into the highway budget. Towns and cities trimmed back, too.
INSKEEP: So if you get this resolution passed, of course, it's a framework, it's an idea, it's a proposal and then you would need specific legislation to encourage wind power, to encourage solar, to do any number of things - efficiency, on and on. Those proposals, just mechanically, would need to move through various House committees, like the Energy and Commerce Committee, on its way to becoming law, committees that are chaired by Democrats who you have questioned or criticized because they take, for example, energy money. Frank Pallone of the Energy and Commerce Committee comes to mind. Do you have confidence in your fellow, more senior, Democrats that they would move the legislation that is necessary to do what you think needs to be done?

And think of what you're doing. Let's say you don't do it. Somebody says, Well, we have to obey the Constitution. And you are, because you're protecting our country and you're protecting the Constitution. So you are.
What Biden did was notable, because few politicians since have made a strong case in favor of government doing more, as public trust in government has eroded significantly since the mid-20th century.
One question then for voters is how squeezed they feel. Attending an Orangeburg County Democrats meeting, Kenneth McCaster said he isn't worried about his own economic well-being.

OSNOS: A trade war could be a really dramatic turn in American economic history. If you talk to independent analysts, people who are not involved in either campaign, somebody - there's a guy, for instance, named Mark Zandi, who's an economist at Moody's Analytics. And he's worked for Republicans and he's worked for Democrats in the past. And what he says is that Trump's plan, if he actually did the things that he said he would and triggered a trade war with China that that would put probably somewhere around 4 million Americans out of work. And then over the ensuing recession that it would also cost the economy another 3 million jobs that would have been created otherwise.
MARTIN: It's a little angel on your shoulder saying, remember, you wanted to save for a down payment or, you know, remember, versus the one saying...
The only way this can be explained is if tens of thousands of illegitimate votes were added to the tally. That's the only way you could explain it.
That's already a sizable majority, but depending on whether people knew tax rates on the richest had indeed fallen (or, alternately, that the rich now pay a higher share in taxes), it could change what they think should happen to those marginal rates. (Of course, it's also possible that historical rates wouldn't affect their views at all.)
MARTIN: And what about President Trump's role in this? Do you think he has a role in this? Some people see him as the symptom. Some people see him as the cause. How do you see him?

[Homeownership recently hit a 51-year low, as the Associated Press recently reported. However, the homeownership rate can be deceiving, as Trulia Chief Economist Jed Kolko wrote in 2014 at the New York Times. For some young adults who live with their parents, renting their own apartments could be a sign of economic progress. But as they go out and create their own households in those rented apartments, that could push down the homeownership rate (measured as a share of all households), even while their situations are improving. — Danielle Kurtzleben]
INSKEEP: Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, always a pleasure talking with you. Thank you so much.
Trump has released two lists, adding up to 21 judges, to fill the Supreme Court vacancy resulting from Antonin Scalia's death last February. According to NPR's Nina Totenberg, the lists are very conservative and a lot is unknown about who is helping Trump make this selection. With two other justices over 80 years old, it's possible Trump will be able to nominate more than one justice during his presidency.
A search warrant in a case like this is highly unusual, Jeffress said.
So, I mean, I could go on and on about this fraud that took place in every state, and all of these legislatures want this back. I don't want to do it to you because I love you and it's freezing out here. But I could just go on forever. I can tell you this.
But then, Schlafly was fighting for Barry Goldwater, the outsider, far-right candidate who was running for president. And she got her wish in 1964, when the Republican Party nominated Goldwater. Though he was soundly defeated in the general election, his nomination was the start of a political shift in the GOP.
But I also think that Andrew Breitbart's larger motive here is to question the mainstream press. To make it seem as though we have done something wrong in reporting that this incident occurred without so-called proof. As I said to a commenter on my blog, the people most likely to be standing out there with video cameras were members of the Tea Party movement. Are they going to come forward and say, yes, we have proof that this happened? That's unlikely.
DAVIES: So you often have cities that are enacting these ordinances but they're outnumbered by rural and suburban legislators in the state the state capital.
Two trade groups, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), sent a joint letter to members of Congress last week saying that extending the credits would allow our member companies to hire thousands of additional workers and inject billions in the U.S. economy.
Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, who has long championed anti-obesity and nutrition efforts, recently mounted a campaign against energy drinks for kids. He appeared on Good Morning Britain in November, telling the anchors that since the advent of energy drinks, some children consume about 14 espresso shots worth of caffeine per day. He ran a spot on his own show, Friday Night Feast, detailing the dangers energy drinks pose for kids' health and their prospects in school. He also started a hashtag on Twitter: #NotForChildren.

Even when Congress agrees that action is required, members tend to focus on petty differences rather than getting the job done, James Davis, a senior official in the Koch network, wrote in a recent op-ed. Our fervent hope is that even isolated agreements won't just advance good policy but will also help tear down the walls of mistrust and bitterness that have degraded our politics and turned Americans against one another.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I do blame past administrations for allowing this out-of-control trade deficit to take place and to grow. We have to fix this because it just doesn't work for our great American companies, and it doesn't work for our great American workers.
He says that all along, he just wanted the U.S. government to buy back debt at lower prices.

I've seen the police and undercover police very - roughhousing, you know, manhandling people, grabbing, exfiltrating them from the protest because there's a lot of - I don't know - anarchists, troublemakers - call them what you want - who've come out here to do this.

GONYEA: Boy, they love the latest polls. But they kind of take a deep breath, saying they are confident, but hey, hey, this is Florida. It's always a battleground. Now, demographic changes in the state make it perhaps more friendly to Democrats than it has been in past years. But right here in the center of the state where the I-4 freeway cuts across, this is where elections are won and lost, and the people at this rally know it.
INSKEEP: Now when you say tax credit, that's different from a deduction. That means whatever my tax bill might be, I just reduce it by $2,000 if I have a kid. Is that right?

Congress and the White House appear to have an agreement on providing transit agencies at least $20 billion in aid. Whether it'll be enough depends on how long riders continue to work from home.
It's unclear what the overall impact of Trump's plan will be on the federal budget deficit. While the proposed military buildup may be offset by domestic spending cuts, the size and nature of the yet-to-be-released tax reform proposal will determine the deficit picture.

OSNOS: He can. The president has authority, ultimate authority over 15 executive agencies. And he would be able to direct them to change the pace and spirit in which they are issuing regulations. He has said - I'm not clear on whether this is legally possible - that he wants to do a version of what Vice President-elect Mike Pence did in Indiana.
House and Senate bills have similar design
The Trump administration wants $241 million for the IRS, to allow it to improve taxpayer services for the extended filing season and new tax credit questions, provide taxpayers with new forms and information online for new credits, implement a manual process for the proposed paid leave tax credit, and enhance IRS information technology capacity to respond and interact with taxpayers.

That's why Mark, who studied at nearby Johnson & Wales University and trained at restaurants in Providence and New York City, has joined a growing chorus of small-business owners who are supporting Medicare for All, or some other type of government-sponsored, universal health plan.
Still, that process is likely to take years. Many regulations, like the federal fuel economy rules for cars and trucks, require a lengthy rulemaking process with scientific analysis and public comment. As a result, many of the Trump administration's rules only went into effect in his last year in office.
That's exactly what we are doing. For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL's financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we are taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, and their weapons. We are training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.

Currently, her antitrust office is investigating Amazon, Apple, and Facebook for unfair business practices.
SIMON: It'll reach the president by December 25?
In the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy, Trump said. Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people. This is really the key. These are the people we were elected to serve.
This enables your people to spend their day dedicated to the thing you're paying them to do. It enables them to not have to quit their jobs and to be able to give you their dedicated effort, so I'm a little surprised that there hasn't been more of an effort here.
A U.S. Navy SEAL was killed during a raid in Yemen targeting al-Qaida militants, the first military casualty of Trump's administration. Later in the week, questions were raised over how the operation — which also is believed to have killed several civilians — was carried out.
Republicans argue that these initiatives would mean drastic changes to the economy, result in job losses in certain sectors and negatively impact energy companies' bottom lines.
That's the average favorability rating from four of the United States' closest allies: the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Japan. It's the lowest in at least two decades, rivaling only when the U.S. was engaged in the Iraq War.
Talking about changing the economy structurally, as more-progressive candidates in particular often highlight, can also mean talking about persistent racial inequities. Businessman Tom Steyer highlighted this at this week's debate.
Biden referenced Sanders' statement in defending the bill's compromises, which Biden said did not substantially affect its substance.
As they've boomed onto the market, energy drinks have been linked to emergency room visits, as well as a number of high-profile deaths, although it's impossible to say definitively that energy drinks are the only culprit in those extreme situations.
Meadows said conservatives he has talked to are making their feelings very clear. The outcry from the grass roots is undeniably disappointment, he said.
SALTER: I don't know. I'm not a child psychologist. I would guess that, you know, he's - he craves the sort of admiration from the corridors that Senator McCain received it and doesn't get it and resents him for that.

Jane McAlevey is an organizer and labor scholar who pretty much predicted what's going on right now. She published a book in 2016, No Shortcuts, arguing that in reaction to decades of tax cuts and budget cuts, education and healthcare workers will create a woman-led new labor union movement.
The new plan adopts individual tax brackets from the House Republicans' tax plan, creating three brackets of 12, 25, and 33 percent (down from the current seven brackets). It would also lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, eliminate the estate tax and increase the standard deduction, among other things. Altogether, over 10 years, it would reduce federal revenue by around $4.4 trillion to $5.9 trillion.

On North Korea, Trump has a record of using controversial rhetoric, including taunting North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un as Little Rocket Man and comparing the size of the countries' nuclear buttons.
But I want to thank all of those congressmen and women. I also want to thank our 13, most courageous members of the U.S. Senate. Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Ron Johnson, Senator Josh Hawley, Kelly Loeffler.
Even those who support the law say that mismatch would effectively shut down the health exchanges, because insurers would simply drop out. A Trump administration really could collapse the federal exchange marketplace and the state exchanges if they end cost-sharing payments to insurers, said Rosenbaum, who has been a strong backer of the health law. There is already some concern about the continuing viability of the exchanges after several large insurers, including Aetna and United HealthCare, announced they would be dropping out for 2017.
So too does the press have to document developments as they unfold in the Trump presidency.
Republicans are very much expecting significant tax reform, DuHaime said, adding, If we're into the summer, and we don't see any movement on tax reform, that would be a problem.

But in recent years, some churches have participated in Pulpit Freedom Sunday, when they blatantly violate the Johnson Amendment and all but dare the IRS to take action.

In terms of making workers more productive, Moore says big tax cuts for businesses will boost investment in new equipment and technologies, such as autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence.
GRANHOLM: I am all about anybody who's obsessed with trying to keep jobs in America in a global economy. Now, can the president do this indefinitely - calling up every job provider across the country and trying to persuade them if they threaten to leave - of course not. But what he could do is to see a national policy that helps governors try to keep and create industrial clusters in their states. You just have to make sure that it is a policy that works overall and not just on one-off deals.
When Does COVID-19 Become A Disability? 'Long-Haulers' Push For Answers And Benefits
Other veteran Republican operatives are coming to Diaz's defense.
Holtz-Eakin is referring to the fact that Congress recently passed a budget blueprint that would allow a tax overhaul to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over a decade — the standard length of time over which the CBO scores a policy's impacts on the budget. That budget framework would allow a tax bill to pass with just 51 votes in the Senate, instead of the usual 60. Republicans hold 52 seats.
If you believe in any local autonomy, as Republicans claim to, then the broad version of reciprocity undermines that significantly, Winkler says. Because a state or city like Los Angeles would no longer be able to control who carries guns in public.

When companies invest more in plants and equipment, they become more productive, which leads to higher wages, even for low-skilled workers, according to a recent report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers.
Cardinal: Preparedness is key. Nepal, Bangladesh and India are no strangers to emergency. They've done a lot over the last decade: making sure people evacuate and know where to seek shelter, making sure governments are ready to support the population. We've seen that in both [Texas and South Asia].
MARTIN: So, I mean, let's just take a second and talk about the economics of this because the global economy has obviously taken a massive hit. I can only imagine the local economy in New Rochelle has seen an effect.
Ryan would not say Republican policies won't increase the deficit in the short term, but he reiterated a long-standing commitment to paying for new spending. We are fiscal conservatives. If we're going to be spending on things like say, infrastructure, we're going to find the fiscal space to pay for that in our spring budget, he said, referring to the annual budget resolution.

Facebook told NPR on Monday that it was pausing the spending of its political action committee for at least the first three months of the year, while we review our policies.
Privacy advocates also worry about a more basic problem: the misuse of all this personal information. Two months ago in Massachusetts, law enforcement officials were found to be snooping into the lives of local celebrities. They poked around New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady's personal information just because they were curious. So they looked up his address and whether he was a gun owner; they did this 968 times.
WESSEL: Well, most people's economic fortunes did improve during the 2010s as the economy slowly climbed out of this terrible Great Recession. But by almost any measure, the gap between the people at the very top and the rest of us continued to widen. There are a couple of economists at Berkeley - Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman - who've done a lot of work on this, and they say that the income before taxes of the top 1% is now a bigger share of the pie than at any time since the 1920s.
TRUMP: Now, of course, I was swashbuckling, and it did well for me, and it was good for me and all that. And, you know, debt was sort of always interesting to me. Now we're in a different situation with the country, but I would borrow knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal.

House Republican leaders have a much more dramatic idea. They would levy what they call a border adjustment tax of 20 percent on imports from all countries.
CARANCI: They could say that. Our experience locally is that they have not. But even if they did, making something subject to taxation based on a very subjective interpretation is highly unusual, I would say. And it's grossly unfair.
Stock Market Tumbles, Trading Briefly Halts
The FBI wants to build a safer and more modern set of buildings outside Washington. In exchange for building them, the developer who submits the winning bid will get the large Pennsylvania Avenue property where the FBI's aging, Brutalist-style headquarters is now located.
ESPUELAS: Well, I have my theories. I think that there is a group of people in the Congress that represent a minority of Americans, based on the polling, that adamantly are against any kind of immigration reform, perhaps are somewhat threatened - emotionally threatened by the demographic changes in the country. And they see blocking immigration reform as a way of stopping history at a certain level. I know that sounds like too easy an answer, but at the same time, I actually have attended some of these Tea Party rallies and heard some of these congresspeople speak. And they really do speak in rather harsh terms about immigrants and about what's happened in this country without recognizing that this is a process. This is a system that has broken down, and we have to fix the system, not for the immigrants, but really for the country.
That's the more controversial version of national reciprocity, Winkler says. I'm not sure that's the one we'll get, but the NRA is most likely going to push for the broadest version of national reciprocity.
LAFFER: Yeah, that's how. And if you look at their proposals if combined with Trump's vision of the world - not literal proposal - I don't think you're going to have any huge increase in deficits on a static basis.
For example, NPR recently reported on the effect of eliminating a tax deduction for medical expenses. In our interview, Ryan downplayed the effects of this change.
Oliver, teachers and those policy groups count the energy drink bans for kids in grocery stores as a victory, but they're not a perfect, overarching solution. The issue with it is that these products will still be bought in convenience stores and other small stores, Hashem says. So while these are positive steps, she says she's still hoping a national law will eventually come into effect.
DONOVAN: That may be a part of it. Every president in recent history's been measuring their accomplishments in their first hundred days. I think the president really wants to get this done with. He has three things to do in one calendar year. He knows how difficult that is. And so I think part of it may be the hundred-day review of his successes so far. But I really think you must get these three things done before we start to - we get these done in this calendar year.
But delivering might be tougher than Republicans and Trump may have thought. Right now, it seems, the bill, as currently written, doesn't have the votes. Asked if it did by CNN's Jake Tapper, House Speaker Paul Ryan deflected, calling Tapper's question goofy.
We want to talk more about one of the central figures in the negotiations still playing out in the U.S. Senate over how the Senate will conduct its business in the next few years, and we're talking about Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell. The pair of Georgia runoff victories earlier this month gave Democrats 50 seats in the Senate. And that means McConnell, a Republican, is out as majority leader for the first time since 2015. And that's not all. Less than an hour before the mob invaded the Capitol, McConnell, the key factor in carrying Trump's agenda to fruition, finally shut down Trump's false claims about election fraud. And since the attack on the Capitol, he's gone even further, publicly blaming Trump for instigating the crowd, and privately, at least according to journalists, signaling a willingness to consider impeachment.
As the industry and the City of Philadelphia prepare to face off in court, the legal arguments are strictly economic. The hotly debated issue of whether a soda tax is a good way to help nudge people towards healthier behaviors is not part of the argument.

Oxfam thinks so. Its report says that if the world's richest 1 percent just paid an extra 0.5 percent in taxes, there would be enough money to educate all 262 million children who are out of school according to U.N. calculations and provide enough health care to save the lives of 3.3 million people who are likely to die from lack of proper treatment for medical conditions.
Lawyers working for Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller objected Wednesday to Manafort's bid to delay the trial scheduled for July 25 in Alexandria, Va. To make their case, they cited recorded jail calls and prison logs suggesting Manafort has been getting better treatment than most detainees, not worse.
As Germany and the U.S. face the future they are caught in a grass is always greener moment, where each sees in the other the thing it does not have. Even if Germany is really good at manufacturing, maybe it needs to try to emulate the U.S. and start looking beyond manufacturing to find postindustrial jobs to drive its economy.
I worry that that's what kids begin to think giving is — serving your needs and other peoples' needs. And they don't have an image in their head of another kind of giving: a tenacious, low-profile kind of altruism that's really just about the other person, and not about you, he says. And I think we're in really deep trouble as a society if that sense of morality for its own sake evaporates.

Some Republicans have criticized Democrats for even considering reconciliation as a way to pass legislation as massive as the $1.9 trillion Biden is suggesting. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, is already raising red flags about Biden's plan to increase the federal minimum wage to $15. Cornyn told reporters in the Capitol that a minimum wage increase isn't allowed under budget rules.
DAVIES: Well, this is an interesting and important question. And you can't predict the future, but if, in fact, one of his core beliefs is that this is a big problem, we have to fix this to rebuild the American economy, what do the economists you talk to expect to happen? Are we going to have a trade war? What would it do?
Allison listened, then reacted: I don't know, it's tough right now. Then people say Trump has created thousands of jobs. Hillary's not created a single job.
And the middle class is already struggling. The median household income is roughly $59,000 a year. But around the country, even six-figure salaries for some single-person households don't necessarily furnish financial security.
KING: And because you guys are in separate parts of the house this morning, I wonder - and because it's been a while since you've seen each other or touched each other - I wonder, what message do you have for each other this morning?
The President has made it clear we will have enough vaccines for every American by the end of May and I am confident the economic recovery will follow, Manchin said in a statement. We have reached a compromise that enables the economy to rebound quickly while also protecting those receiving unemployment benefits from being hit with unexpected tax bill next year.
But George Yin, a law professor at the University of Virginia, testified at the hearing that existing law requires the Treasury Department to comply. I don't see any wiggle room in the statute for the secretary to refuse a request, Yin said.
Where we could, we gave Trump's stances a simple Yes or No, but also used the rating It's Complicated in cases where his stance is more nuanced or has changed.
If Trump wanted to seriously damage the ACA, he could simply order the appeal dropped, letting the lower court ruling stand, and stop reimbursing insurers who are giving deep discounts to half their customers. That move would wreak havoc, said Michael Cannon of the libertarian Cato Institute, a longtime opponent of the health law. The insurers would still have to provide the discounts, as required by law, he said, but they're no longer getting subsidies from the federal government to cover the cost. So they are going to be selling insurance to these people way below the cost of that coverage.
We can accomplish these great things, and so much more – all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again. Start believing. It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.
This year is different. The previous Congress did not pass a budget for 2020, which means Democrats have the chance to attach reconciliation instructions to a 2020 budget and a 2021 budget, if they can agree on what those budgets should include.

In about half a decade, the phrase has gone from its slang origins to being laden with partisan political baggage. And the recent GOP fixation on cancel culture is, for some, a sign of a party that has strayed from its core tenets.
He asks how old they will be in 2036, and, if they are thinking of having kids, how old their kids will be.
He says the cameras can capture activities where the public can help, like identifying fire, or a crowd gathered around someone in distress. One down side, though, is that the public could misread what they're seeing — like mistaking someone handing off a book to someone else as a drug deal.
Exelon plans to close its Three Mile Island Unit 1 reactor near Harrisburg in September, and FirstEnergy intends to retire its Beaver Valley plant outside Pittsburgh in 2021. The early closures are part of a broader trend across the U.S. as the nuclear power industry has struggled amid slowing demand for electricity and competition from cheaper natural gas and renewables. Without new policies, natural gas generation is largely expected to take the place of retiring nuclear plants, which would mean higher carbon emissions from the power sector.
Mr. McKINNEY: You had industries that could get rid of their waste cheaply. The society didn't have to pay the true costs of disposal at the time. Now that we do have to pay the true costs of disposal, that should be handled by society.
But Clausing says the reality is a lot more complicated.
LUCAS: Right. So Parnas played a key role in helping Giuliani dig up dirt in Ukraine on Joe Biden. He actively engaged with Ukrainian officials in text messages, met with them in person. Parnas was indicted in October by federal prosecutors in New York on campaign finance charges. Those are not directly related to his work with Giuliani in Ukraine.

But what do you say to your colleagues in swing seats who helped win this Democratic majority who look at impeachment and just see a total political loser that could cost you your majority in the House?
Republicans have offered limited changes to the bill, according to several Democratic aides involved in the talks. So far the GOP proposals under consideration would not fundamentally change the implementation of the proposals, the aides said.

I mean, I think the stimulus argument is not really what this is about - to me, anyway. It's a fairness argument.
BROWN: I don't know. I've got - it's an earthquake for a family. I mean, everything - it's going to be a personal decision in that way. But I, you know, I think that in too many cases, Congress - too many people are in this country - too many Democrats.

I think you need to do both.

[The number of families apprehended this fiscal year along the Southwestern border thus far (that is, starting in October 2015) is around 51,000, according to Border Patrol data. That is already over the nearly 40,000 apprehended during fiscal year 2015. Total apprehensions are also on pace to exceed their 2015 total, as well, according to these data. However, that wouldn't be a very high number in the context of recent years; total apprehensions at the border today are far, far lower than they were in the early 2000s. — Danielle Kurtzleben]
In recent months, there have been several Save the NHS marches across Britain, where thousands have demonstrated to demand improved care and more funding for the health system. One such march, on Feb. 3 on Downing Street in central London, caught President Trump's attention.
This is one of the most important western public lands cases in modern history. It arrives at a political moment in which the integrity of many institutions is being called into question and when accusations of so-called fake news come from the highest levels, including the government itself.
Trump also signed an executive order reinstating the Mexico City policy, a global gag rule prohibiting international nongovernmental organizations that provide or talk about abortion services from receiving federal funding. He also signaled his intent to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and instituted a federal hiring freeze except for the military.
It's a long time ago, and he voted that way and they were also misled, Trump answered.
GRAVES: That's correct, although there may be some differences depending on whether a city has home rule under statutory provision or under the Constitution. But in general, it's just not the way things have been done in this country for many, many years, to have the states be taking away the authority of local communities. In fact, what you've had is the opposite. You've had a trend in which the rhetoric on the right and the left has been really pro-city, has really been focused on empowering cities and talking about cities as being crucial players in our democracy and in fact the most responsive part of our democracy in our federal, state and local systems.
People who receive Social Security or other federal benefits will receive the payment in the same way as their regular benefits. The IRS has not yet announced a payment date for this group, but says it will do so shortly.

PLUTA: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer announced Whitmer will deliver the response and described her as a model to be emulated. Their statement praised Whitmer's work for clean drinking water in the wake of the Flint water crisis - also, her still-unfulfilled campaign promise to fix the damn roads in a state where underinvestment and freeze-and-thaw weather cycles wreak havoc on asphalt and concrete.
[This is technically true. Detroit city proper has an unemployment rate of 11.6 percent, which is twice the national average of 4.9 percent. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics often figures these numbers by metro area. The Detroit metro area has an unemployment rate of 5.8 percent. -Will Huntsberry]
It will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive, Pelosi told Politico. The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they're for it right?
For his part, Rooney is in favor of a carbon tax, a policy he helped propose with a bipartisan group of lawmakers in November. Information from Ocasio-Cortez's office says that the Green New Deal could include a carbon tax, but that it would be a tiny part of the total package of policies.

Both said they were still undecided, though Allison suggested he'll be looking very closely at Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson. He encouraged Hostetler to do the same.

You went to graduate school here, and you still have difficulty figuring out how to normalize your situation. Could you talk a little bit more about that?
Nearly all congressional Republicans are self-described fiscal conservatives. But Trump has shown support for vast new federal spending — like that $1 trillion infrastructure proposal — and an indifference to deficit spending if it can spur U.S. economic growth. For instance, Republicans largely agree that tax cuts do not need to be paid for and consider them economic stimulus.
When President Trump left the White House, he stopped by and spoke to reporters. He did not take any questions but he did thank the press. Trump later addressed supporters at Joint Base Andrews.

And what I meant by that was that we're a party of inclusion and not exclusion; we're a party of addition and not division; and that I believe that Reverend Robertson was leading our party in a way that made us exclusionary and frankly would doom us to a minority status. And I couldn't articulate my vision for the future of the party without saying I reject that kind of leadership of our party.

Churchill Downs attracts more than 150,000 spectators for the race. But new federal guidelines recommend limiting public gatherings to a much smaller size – on Monday, the Trump administration advised Americans to avoid gathering in groups of 10 or more.

Still, she says, the provision is not a big enticement to companies.
Can I ask you each about this other incident that's gotten a lot of attention? As the health care bill was being debated, there was this whole question about whether a number of lawmakers were verbally and physically abused by some activists who were demonstrating in opposition to the bill outside of the Capitol. Some of these protestors were associated with the Tea Party movement. And it has been reported that, you know, some persons used the N-word with Congressman John Lewis, who of course is a hero of the civil rights movement.
But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past. America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.
DOUCLEFF: Yeah, so health officials say that really two things are working together to amplify the problem. First of all, there's actually a surge of measles around the world right now. The World Health Organization just said this week that there have been four times as many cases reported this year as there were at the same time last year. And several countries have these massive outbreaks right now, with tens of thousands of cases, just to put our 500 cases into a global perspective.

I could tell that they didn't know each other, and that they were supporting different candidates for president. Every tweet they hurled back and forth at each other mentioned me, so I got notifications during every step of their online fight. At one point, they began to call each other names, with one young woman calling the other the C word.
Trump, who made keeping manufacturing jobs in the U.S. a central part of his campaign, also promised to do great things for business. He said his administration would work to reduce corporate taxes from 35 percent to hopefully 15 percent. He also pledged to reduce regulations, most of which he said were nonsense, although he conceded some were necessary to protect worker safety and health.

Trump's executive order writes that speech on moral or political issues from a religious perspective should not be penalized, which is in line with existing IRS policies. It suggests an exception for speech that has ordinarily been treated as an endorsement — in other words, the order tells the IRS to enforce the law as it has in the past, and treat churches the same as other nonprofits.

LEVINE: President Trump did, too. And so on both sides, you have this. But speaking about the Democrats and the split in the Democratic Party, I think one question you have going forward is, are there people who can tap into that small donor base and raise money for the party in a different way - the way that Bernie Sanders did? And so I think that money is going to flow into the midterms, and we're going to see who's effective in raising it.
In 1973, more than two-thirds of jobs were held by people with a high school diploma or less, according to a 2014 report by the Center on Education and the Workforce at Georgetown. By 2020, they project, that will be flipped; just over one-third of jobs will require a high school diploma alone or less; two-thirds will call for some kind of postsecondary education.
We'll see how good an investment it is when we see what the interest is from some companies to negotiate, he said.

And while both Clinton and Trump are on record opposing TPP, it's clear that Trump's blunt talk on trade is more appealing to workers like Allison.
LIASSON: One way Democrats can reach those voters is to stick to bread-and-butter issues. Health care was the top concern for Virginia voters. Democrats are also hoping to run against the Republican tax bill, which is seen by many voters as favoring the wealthy more than the middle class. But there are other obstacles Democrats have to overcome. California Congressman Ro Khanna points to the mighty fortress of redistricting that Republicans have erected for themselves, drawing congressional and legislative district lines that make it harder for Democrats to win. And Khanna says, in many states, it's getting harder to vote.

HORSLEY: You can hear that's obviously a popular response with this crowd. The president has also talked about enhancing background checks for gun buyers. By that, he seems to mean getting more information into the database of those who are barred from buying weapons, not necessarily extending background checks to gun sales that aren't subject to them now. And he's also talked about raising the legal age for people to buy long guns. That's a proposal that does put him at odds with the NRA.

Let's talk about South Korea for a moment, because it so perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt so many American workers. President Obama, and the usual so-called experts who've been wrong about every trade deal for decades, predicted that the trade deal with South Korea would increase our exports to South Korea by more than $10 billion – resulting in some 70,000 jobs. Like Hillary Clinton's broken promises to New York, these pledges all turned out to be false. Instead of creating 70,000 jobs, it has killed nearly 100,000 jobs, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Our exports to South Korea haven't increased at all, but their imports to us have surged more than $15 billion – more than doubling our trade deficit with that country. What else is new? It's happening with everyone.
That's a refrain that's not limited to union members. But one area where Allison sets his dissatisfaction aside is when he listens to Trump talk about trade issues.

GURIAN: Enter Senator Frank Lautenberg, the New Jersey Democrat who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee that oversees the Superfund. Since the tax on the oil and chemical industries expired in 1995, he and his colleagues have introduced legislation every year to reinstate it. But now with the support of President Obama, it has a good chance of becoming law.
Anton spoke just as Trump was nearing his first 100 days in office — and as the president was discovering some of the limits on what he could achieve.
So he's looking for a full time job with benefits. Until then? Franco hasn't really explored his options. He's a member of the millennial generation. They represent more than a quarter of the nation's population. These are people 18 to 34 years old, and we're hearing a lot about them in the health care debate. How they fare under the GOP health care bill going through Congress is complicated.
KELLY: And Rachel, we're talking fuel, not just the lack of gasoline, but the few places that do have electricity are running on diesel-powered generators. And that's also in scarce supply. Lack of diesel is coming - is emerging as a real problem for hospitals and others in need of lifesaving equipment. One doctor, Pedro Escobar (ph), who works at a hospital in San Juan, was saying they had power yesterday, but he is still worried.
MITT ROMNEY: Mr. Trump is directing our anger for less than noble purposes.
DETROW: So what does this order mean for Venezuelans living in the United States without this status?
Africa's not the only corrupt continent.
WU: I think that was his perspective, which he telegraphed kind of early. I was alone among legal analysts predicting something in the single digits because of that. Ellis is very experienced. I think he was swayed by the argument that you have to look to other similarly situated defendants charged with these issues. He did seem to have some hostility towards the special counsel lawyers, though, during the trial, so I think that did factor in.
No sooner had Geithner opened the door to a middle-class tax hike than White House spokesman Robert Gibbs slammed it shut.
CORNISH: Wow. OK, all of that just because of what is - what, a computer glitch, it sounds like.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: There has been a lot about the Trump presidency that's been - I think, to put it in polite reporter terms - remarkable. But his reaction to Charlottesville last year ranks pretty high.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: ...In a way that some...
President Trump said Monday evening that he hoped lawmakers would make a breakthrough.
Twenty-five years ago, as a rookie reporter in North Carolina, I witnessed an impromptu debate that broke out between two Duke University trustees about the point and power of journalism.
The rift within the Republican Party spilled out into full view this week.
[Clinton and Trump alike are in favor of renegotiating NAFTA, as the Washington Post's Fact Checker reports. — Danielle Kurtzleben]
NPR's Audie Cornish talks with George Washington University law professor Miriam Galston about the Johnson Amendment. It's a tax code provision that prevents tax-exempt organizations from engaging in political activities. President Trump says his administration will totally destroy it.
There's a lack of representation in the top spots, says Simone, of women in general and women of color in particular. I saw that early on when I was an intern at the Food Network, especially as someone who wasn't coming from one of the big culinary schools, but from a school where all my classmates were black and brown people. I was lucky, but most people at the smaller schools don't even have the opportunity to get those internships, and even when you do, you don't usually see someone in charge who looks like you.
That makes a huge difference when it comes to revenue. Given the uncertainty, the Tax Foundation created two estimates of what the plan could do. If pass-through income is taxed at the lower rate, revenue would shrink by $5.9 trillion over 10 years on a static basis (that is, not including the effects of economic growth). If it were taxed at higher, individual income tax rates, the revenue cut would be nearly $4.4 trillion.
McCarthy listed some of his concerns at a press conference Thursday. He told reporters that it would take too long to execute the program which, as written, would require companies with 50 or more employees to pay workers who are laid off, fired or are unable to work because of the coronavirus, or any public health emergency.
RASCOE: Yes. So at the very top - but this is just time-wise, speaking-time-wise - former Vice President Joe Biden. And he clocked in at 17 minutes, eight seconds. And right behind him came Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who clocked in at 16 minutes, 38 seconds. So after them, in kind of descending order, you have Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, California Senator Kamala Harris, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former HUD Secretary Julian Castro, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke. And businessman Andrew Yang clocked in at the very end with eight minutes, one second.
The Senate returns Wednesday, and President Trump made his way back to Washington on Monday after lying fairly low to end the year in Palm Beach, Fla., at his personal resort.
There was this rally, also, in South Carolina that day, yesterday, looking at, you know, the $15 minimum wage for McDonald's workers. So a lot of these candidates were out there with these people that were striking for that $15 national minimum wage and also, you know, unionization rights and trying to, you know, form unions for these workers in South Carolina, which is a right-to-work state, so it's very difficult. A lot of them were really still on their talking points besides that - Elizabeth Warren talking about her tax on ultra-millionaires, which she said could help fund education proposals. And of course, a lot of them also talking about student debt cancelation and tuition-free college.
It's not a good number for members of Congress in competitive seats to be looking at when they're planning their re-election strategy, he said. They can't attack Trump for fear of turning off their base, but they still have to reach out to voters who are turned off by the president.
WARREN: What families have to deal with is cost, total cost. That's what they have to deal with and understand. Families are paying for their health care today. Families pay every time an insurance company says, sorry, you can't see that specialist. Every time an insurance company says, sorry, that doctor is out of network. Sorry, we are not covering that prescription.

Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan says that in addition to worries directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the drivers are also coping with the loss of many of their restroom break sites. Because of new restrictions at hospitals and restaurants, drivers who relied on those facilities at the end of their routes found themselves unable to wash up and use restrooms as they came back, Duggan said, according to local TV station Click On Detroit.

MARTIN: All right. So my sister happens to work in the restaurant industry. I was talking to her yesterday. And she was just heartbroken because this is work - as you know, people who work in the industry, they socialize with their coworkers. They become sort of your extended family. Her entire community, her entire network has been affected by this. We heard from some employees just a couple minutes ago who are deeply concerned about their own future. What is your message to them right now?
By legalizing without all the guardrails in place, I feel the message can be misconstrued ... that we have dropped the ball on the justice pieces, said Del. Marcia Price (D-Newport News), according to the Post. Even the thought of business before justice is hard to stomach.
SIMAR SORIANO: My name is Simar Soriano (ph). I am a food server in San Francisco, Calif. The last couple of weeks have been extremely stressful and pretty scary. A lot of people stopped coming out. Normally, I work six shifts a week. And last week, I was scheduled three shifts a week. I basically used the last of my money to pay off bills for this month and to buy what groceries I could.
How do you protect a country from an illness? Closing businesses and telling people to stay home without letting the economic bottom drop out. That's what lawmakers in Washington are trying to negotiate right now. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, urged members of his body not to wander too far after they passed an emergency relief package yesterday. That's because there's another, even larger stimulus plan in the works. And his team is expected to talk that over with his Senate counterpart, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who joins us now on the line. Senator, thanks so much for being with us.
It is centuries of slavery — violence associated with slavery, Harris said. There was never any real intervention to break up what had been generations of people experiencing the highest forms of trauma, and trauma undiagnosed and untreated leads to physiological outcomes.
BOOKER: No. I think that was one of the problems. We were one of America's most underestimated cities. It was a city that had a lot of challenges. But after all eight years of work, it's had its biggest economic development boom in 60 years. I'm really proud.
KAHN: No, not on its own. Guatemala is one of the poorest in the hemisphere, and tens of thousands of Guatemalans themselves are fleeing the country due to the violence there and the extreme poverty. Could they handle tens of thousands of Hondurans and Salvadorans asking for asylum? You know, I was curious when I was there just last week. So I went to the tiny asylum office in the capital, and it is overwhelmed and under-resourced, as you would imagine. I asked Carla Ramirez (ph) the spokeswoman for the agency - I just asked her point-blank, can you deal with a surge in asylum applicants? And here's what she said.
That bolded bit, about making a deal on debt, caused mass freakout in the financial press, and for good reason. Suggesting that U.S. creditors accept haircuts on U.S. debt (that is, accept lower payouts than they agreed to) would be an unheard-of, potentially disastrous policy proposition.
SHAPIRO: So as you said, there's a ticking clock here. I mean, does all of this mean that the climate goals the administration has set are out of reach and we're going to bust this 1 1/2- or 2-degree Celsius goal?
The email, sent last January from Hillary For America research director Tony Carrk to Podesta and other senior campaign officials, contain flags sent by the Harry Walker Agency — the firm that organized Clinton's Wall Street speeches after she was secretary of state. The flagged portions are positions that Carrk wrote needed an extra scrub and could prove problematic for the campaign in the future.
Alito said there is a world of difference between allowing damage claims that have been allowed in the past and a case like this one, in which, Alito maintained, there were foreign policy and national security issues at stake. Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch, would have gone further and outright overturned the court's 1971 decision and others that followed in its wake.

MAYER: When you talk to people who admire him - and there are some; he's got a very loyal cadre of aides - they like to talk about him as an institutionalist. And he likes to think of himself as somebody who really understands the rules of the Senate and the history of the Senate, reads a lot of history, and that he is representing the institution of the Senate. That's how he likes to see himself. But there are many people, many critics who think that McConnell broke the Senate by using the filibuster so often and bringing gridlock and playing games that in many ways, his legacy has been the opposite of what he'd want to be seen as.
The Democratic Debate Over 'Medicare For All' And Middle-Class Taxes, Explained
GILES: The justification in Arizona is pretty simply put as distrust, citing the misinformation that's out there and citing the fact that there are a lot of these Republican constituents who say they have doubts. Whether or not those doubts are based on any valid information, Republicans have kind of pushed past that and just said the fact that there are doubts justifies continued discussions about the election and changes to the law that they say, you know, might inspire similar confidence in the election and its integrity.
In an NPR interview Thursday, Ryan offered a detailed defense of the tax bill. What follows are some of Ryan's statements, in bold — and some of the facts behind them.
KATHLEEN PARKER: Good morning. Hey, everybody.
Cardinal Health is seeking to exploit the CARES Act provision despite being fiscally healthy during the pandemic, lawmakers wrote.
ART POPE: Ari, thank you for having me on your show. I must correct you, though. I'm far from a kingmaker. The people in North Carolina elect the Republican majority in the legislature by 56 percent majority vote in 2010.
INSKEEP: It is interesting, though, there are a number of very, very wealthy people and Wall Street people who have surrounded Trump who seem to be on their way to key posts in the administration. And I wonder if that does inform their perspective somewhat.
Presidential pardons normally come up at the end of a presidency when a president is on the way out and less worried about controversy. But President Trump began using his pardon power the very first summer he was in office and has hinted at using it in a variety of sensitive cases now pending. This is the sort of historical issue we like to toss to Ron Elving, NPR's senior editor and correspondent on the Washington Desk, the man we call Professor Ron.

Additionally, the Kingdom of Bahrain has donated more than $50,000 to the Clinton Foundation itself, according to the group's records.
The move in Illinois Thursday drew complaints from Republicans, who insisted the tax demand in order to qualify for the state ballot was unconstitutional and selectively avoided other officeholders, including the state's newly installed billionaire governor, Democrat JB Pritzker.
The United States actually also has a financial transaction tax. It funds the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). But the tax is so minuscule nobody seems to notice it. For most kinds of financial transactions, the rate the SEC will charge for 2021 is $5.10 for every million dollars traded (which, by the way, is a tax rate of .00051%). Since the financial crisis, a long list of progressive politicians have called for new financial transaction taxes, including Rep. Peter Defazio, who introduced such a bill last month.
POUNDSTONE: I have a cat named ShamWow.

For millions and millions of Americans, the American dream has been called into question by the stagnation of the past 15 years, Galston said.
HORSLEY: Not exactly. He did not offer a lot of specifics during that hastily arranged statement to the news media after the market closed yesterday. He did promise that he'd have more to say today after he consults with lawmakers. You heard him float the idea of a payroll tax cut there. He has also talked about providing some targeted help for industries such as airlines and cruise ships that have been, obviously, hard-hit by the coronavirus outbreak.

When Sanders released his latest Medicare for All bill, he released a document called options to finance Medicare for All — a list of ways to potentially pay for parts of the bill.
In 2016, she was elected as Baltimore's 50th mayor.
Although the IRS rules don't govern for-profit hospitals, many of those also offer concessions for people with proven financial hardship. The criteria patients need to meet to get charity care — and how generous the hospital is likely to be — vary among institutions, but many give breaks to families with middle-class incomes. Northwell's policy, for instance, extends to families of four earning as much as $132,500 a year.
I'm always looking for puns, says Kaus. And, I was wondering, what can we do to mock this trend of, 'God, we've got to appease the growing Latino vote?'  He tried a few different versions before landing on the word that would go on to be a hashtag. None of the ones with Latino worked, so I tried Hispanic.
It's one of NPR's strengths that it can draw on reporters from hundreds of member stations in states both red and blue. Our reporters consistently capture voters in their own voices. News organizations often struggle to do that.
Right to Rise USA treasurer Charles Spies told NPR that no decision has been made about excess cash.
SHAPIRO: That is Jennifer Granholm, former governor of Michigan, now professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Thank you for joining us.
For months now, Whaley has been part of a bipartisan group of mayors pushing for more help. In December, when Congress approved additional aid, state and local governments were left out.
You know, there was reporting in the course of the campaign that suggests that Donald Trump doesn't have the patience to read long documents and burrow into policy detail. What's your sense of how he'll handle the demands of this, you know, huge waterfront of policy and decisions that you can't put on autopilot that the president needs to weigh in on?
But when it comes to protecting our impartiality, the limitations are often more nuanced than clear. Our cars may not be canvases for political expression, but how about those of our spouses? How do we respond when the conversation at a dinner party turns political? And what about when the deepest aspects of our lives – how we worship, whom we marry – become fodder for societal controversy?
So we've taken care of things, we've done things like nobody's ever thought possible. And that's part of the reason that many people don't like us, because we've done too much.
Potential efforts to try to push businesses to boost the minimum wage, or any changes to tax credits or other elements, mean the bill may pingpong back to the House, since any changes to the package would require another vote.
Voices Of America's Contract Workers: 'I Love The Freedom'
Biden proposes expanding the credit for low-income households and raising it to $3,000 per child and $3,600 for children under 6 years old.
There are places where there's not much choice. But most Americans still have three or more insurance companies to choose from. And premiums, for those of us who get insurance from our employers, have been rising at a much more slow rate than they were before the Affordable Care Act passed.
What it's going to do is lift up the wages of American workers, Spicer said. Right now we've got an influx of cheap labor. It's going to put the American consumer back, net-net, to make sure that American workers get lifted up as well.
President Biden and Democratic lawmakers want to fight child poverty by giving U.S. families a few hundred dollars every month for every child in their household — no strings attached. A kind of child allowance.

SUAREZ: So what would be the most immediate effect of the repeal?
I'm pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day 'trip' than you did, Linton said to jennimiller29. Pretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you'd be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours, she added, followed by a flexing biceps and a winking kissy face emoji. Linton apologized late Tuesday, as CNN reported.
CORNISH: That was Cynthia Nixon. She's running for the Democratic nomination for governor in the state of New York. In the meantime, we have reached out to her opponent, Governor Andrew Cuomo. We hope to hear from him in the next couple of days.

He acted swiftly when he became speaker of the House in 2011. But eventually, Boehner was run out of Washington by the very frogs — as he once referred to members of his own conference — he was trying to keep in the wheelbarrow.
GOP members met Tuesday afternoon and agreed by unanimous consent to withdraw a change to House rules approved late Monday evening, before the new Congress was sworn in, that would have weakened the ethics office, an independent watchdog first established in 2008 under House Democrats.

Arriving in the midst of the pandemic and isolated in her dorm room, Singh's anxiety ballooned when her family had trouble coming up with the money for a $16,000 tuition installment. Hofstra warned her she would have to vacate the dorm after the term ended if she was not paid up. At one point, she ran into obstacles transferring money onto her campus meal card.
KELLY: So those are - and these are the same concerns that you were expressing back in March - that you thought this would be harmful to your constituents. Based on the parts you've seen, does this new version address some of the concerns that the Freedom Caucus Republicans had?
That team would go on to develop things like the Ethernet, the laser printer, and software that's the basis for the Apple and Windows operating systems. But before all that happened, Taylor worked at the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency, or ARPA, and that's where, back in 1968, Taylor and his mentor, another computer visionary named J.C.R. Licklider, wrote a paper that imagined an interconnected computer network.
In fact, not a single nonpartisan analysis — from the Joint Committee on Taxation to the Tax Policy Center to the Congressional Budget Office — has found this to be the case for the bills going through Congress.
MCEVERS: We just heard a report on how committed Bernie Sanders' supporters are and what a negative view they have of Clinton. How might that affect Hillary Clinton in a general election race?

GREENE: Level of intensity and raising the heat. Like, why is that productive, and why is a shutdown the only way to do that?
HORSLEY: The administration wants to send every adult a thousand dollars, along with $500 for every child. And it's talking about sending a second payment in about six weeks. Senate Republicans have crafted their own bill that calls for a one-time payout of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child. Those payments would be reduced, though, for people making more than $75,000 or couples making more than $150,000. The payments would also be reduced for people with little or no income tax liability.

MCEVERS: Yeah. Happy to work with my colleagues, yes.
Policy researchers have called for energy drink legislation. Fuse, the Centre for Translational Research in Public Health, advocated for a law restricting energy drink sales to kids after finding that energy drinks are widely available for students as young as 11 years old. Another group, Action on Sugar, which runs nutrition-focused campaigns from Queen Mary University of London, has also rallied for regulation of these drinks. Although Action on Sugar focuses on sweeteners, the high caffeine in energy drinks worries them, too, says Kawther Hashem, a nutritionist and researcher for the group. Why is it that we have a warning label, but children can buy these products? she says.
He then said to Guaidó: Please take this message back that all Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom.
I think there are two basic reasons for the importance of this and the necessity of it in the American Rescue Plan. First, the fact is that there was discrimination in the '70s and '80s and into the '90s at USDA that made it very difficult for socially disadvantaged producers to access fully and completely the programs at USDA. And the result, of course, is that over a period of time, they get further and further behind.

A lot of times they don't want to pass it because it's a budget issue ... they're in debt, Boxed's Mehta says. But, she says, ultimately by saving women money on these items hopefully they will spend it on other items and have more disposable income.
Mademba has spoken about the high costs with manufacturers, who complain that while finished products aren't taxed, the materials used to make them still are. So maybe that needs to be rethought, Mademba says.
Some new middle-skill jobs are in fact starting to show up. The green jobs and advanced manufacturing jobs that President Obama has been fond of touting are a few. Some health care assistance professions, like radiology or phlebotomy (that is, people who draw blood at labs or doctors' offices) are also set to grow quickly. Indeed, growth in the middle has picked up a bit in recent years.
As Vanity Fair reports, AMC pulling The Walking Dead could strike an even bigger blow to Georgia than a Disney boycott. The magazine adds: In addition to creating local jobs, the hugely popular show has had a massively beneficial impact on the local tourism and housing markets.
Governor Jay Inslee of Washington state says combating climate change is the defining challenge of our time - so much so that he is framing his entire presidential campaign around it. I spoke with the governor as part of our Opening Arguments series with 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, and I asked Inslee why he believes combating climate change can get him all the way to the White House.
STONE: It really depends on who you talk to. The number that was held up repeatedly was an average increase of about 116 percent for the benchmark plan here. The caveat is that most people don't feel that price hike because they're insulated by the tax credits under the Affordable Care Act. The Republican replacement for that would have lowered the tax credits relatively significantly for a place like Arizona. And the question would have been - how would people have afforded premiums?
Republicans' attacks on the Clinton Foundation intensified this week after The Associated Press published an article claiming that more than half of the private citizens Clinton met with as secretary of state were foundation donors.
To cite one example, when the state's controversial religious freedom law was enacted, Pence appeared on ABC's This Week. In the 12-minute interview, host George Stephanopoulos tried in vain 12 separate times to get an answer to various versions of this question: If a florist in Indiana refuses to provide flowers for a gay couple's wedding, is that legal under the state's new religious freedom law, yes or no?

So it's certainly possible that someone could ship some out the back door, he says.
But the simple fact of the matter is the budget deficit was run up by President Bush. So I would think that if Tea Partiers were animated solely by smaller government, we would have seen the Tea Party movement start a lot sooner.
The establishment was also not blue-collar. The key to next November lies in the real fears and deep resentments which are beginning to agitate the working and lower-middle classes of white America, wrote Andrew Hackman in a 1967 review of Stephen Hess and David Broder's The Republican Establishment. Who would best capture that vote? The un-establishment Ronald Reagan, he wrote — a man who failed in 1968 but would eventually win the White House.
This is the busiest tax day of the year, and the IRS apologizes for the inconvenience this system issue caused for taxpayers, said acting IRS Commissioner David Kautter.
Current defense spending is put at $590 billion, down about 25 percent from the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Still, the U.S. spends more on the military than the next seven countries combined, according to data from 2015.
What has happened is devastating, it's just devastating, says Nick Calio, president and CEO the industry lobbying group Airlines for America. This is a today problem, not a tomorrow problem, he adds.
President Trump says he may pick a nominee for FBI director before he goes overseas on Friday, while the investigation into Russian election interference gets hotter and the fight to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act continues and the effort to revamp the tax code grinds on. Let's check in now with some people who voted for Donald Trump. How's he doing? And how would they like to see these battles play out? Kevin Eisbrenner joins us now from Livonia, Mich.
The package includes proposals to strengthen the country's State Council and boost lawmakers' power over nominations for prime minister and other major government positions. In his address, Putin said the moves are meant to buttress Russia's democratic processes — though many observers find it more likely that they have to do with Putin's as-yet-unclear plans to maintain influence after leaving the presidency.
The Department of Revenue estimates that a single plant would pay about $22 million less in taxes annually because of the tax break — making the 30-year impact for a single plant about $660 million.
That said, there's still useful information in these polls. You just have to look a bit deeper behind the horse race numbers.
If the president allowed it, that would then make it much easier for enforcement agents to be able to go out and find people. Another thing that would be at the disposal of a President is what's known as 287-G of the Immigration Act which would allow the local and state agents, basically cops of one kind or another, to be enlisted in service of the deportation project. So that's how you begin to see, for instance, local police being brought in for the purposes of raiding farms or factories and beginning to achieve the deportation numbers that he's talked about.
SNELL: Well, you know, these documents are pretty new. We just started seeing them. And people are just starting to kind of get a chance to go through this whole - it's a lot of information.
Likewise, Bredesen adds, if I think it's not going to be good for Tennessee, I'm going to be against it. I think that's what senators ought to do.
VA Secretary David Shulkin was fired after coming under scrutiny for taking his wife to Europe at taxpayer expense. He's the second member of Trump's Cabinet fired over apparent ethical lapses.
There are 80 children in a space filled with brightly colored exercise equipment for daily therapies, and classrooms that accommodate child-sized wheelchairs. The cost for residential care is more than $1,000 per month, he says.
The Obama-Clinton agenda of tax, spend and regulate has created a silent nation of jobless Americans. Home ownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.
I feel excited about moving forward in life, said Cynthia Cray, who hadn't cast a ballot in 10 years, ever since she was convicted of a felony.
The growing worldwide movement to tax sugary beverages can no longer be stopped, wrote Harold Goldstein, executive director of Public Health Advocates in a release today. Goldstein pointed to the World Health Organization's recent report calling on nations around the globe to tax sugary drinks.
As of Jan. 31, Right to Rise USA reported $24 million cash on hand. Since then, it has disclosed $22 million in expenditures on political messages, mostly in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. Its report of money raised in February isn't due until March 20.
KEITH: And we're back. And I want to start with Kamala Harris. She is the senator from California, and it seemed like she came into tonight's debate with one mission in mind, and that was to entice President Trump to tweet at her.
DEUTCH: Well, we're moving forward on this so that Congress can do its job. We have three coequal branches of government. And the president and the attorney general have failed to work with us to allow us to do our job when we know from the Muller report that there was a sweeping Russian attack on our election. We know that there were repeated attempts by the Trump campaign to obstruct justice. And we know that there is information that we need in order to fully investigate all of the redactions.
SAGAL: On Sunday, the season finale of blank set a ratings record with 16.5 million viewers.
SWONK: I don't think they acted too soon. I don't think you can act too soon when you have so few tools. You want to make sure you've got them in the system already working and ready to go when they can help because remember, on the margin, even the Fed can help stressed companies that have trouble getting access to credit, getting more access to credit at a difficult time. So that is important. It's not a solution. But it does, on the margin, help us as one step along what's going to be a very long road to travel. So I think that is important.
Trump in his remarks hinted that the child tax credit could also go up. You'll hear the numbers very soon but they're even larger than anticipated, the president said.
(SOUNDBITE OF DEAN MAGRAW'S SEVENTH ONE)
But the president's returns — due on Tuesday — might ultimately prove less revealing about Trump's finances than many of his critics suppose, says Lee Sheppard, columnist at Tax Analysts' Tax Notes.
It will be up to Congress to write the final spending plan, and it's likely there will be strong objections from Democrats to the proposed domestic cuts.
Typically, Congress only gets one shot at reconciliation each year, because they are only allowed to pass one budget for each fiscal year.
The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is now in at least 75 countries, the World Health Organization said in a Wednesday update on the respiratory disease that has killed more than 3,200 people globally. Italy is being hit particularly hard, with more than 2,000 cases.
MCCAIN: No, I was cynical about employing a strategy which even junior officers such as I recognized were - was not a viable one. And I grieve and mourn to this day the loss - unnecessary loss of young American lives. That's the real tragedy of the Vietnam War, is those names that are etched in black granite down on the Mall. But my motivation to enter politics - one of them was to make sure that we learned those lessons and embarked on a healing process between the American people and the veterans who served, including our former enemies, the Vietnamese. So my motivation was a positive one rather than one of disillusionment.
We have hundreds of thousands of people here and I just want them to be recognized by the fake news media. Turn your cameras please and show what's really happening out here because these people are not going to take it any longer. They're not going to take it any longer. Go ahead. Turn your cameras, please. Would you show? They came from all over the world, actually, but they came from all over our country.
It's unclear whether anger over corporate tax breaks will complicate already sensitive opioid settlement talks with counties and cities which continue behind closed doors.
BROOKS: Yeah. I mean, we have the comic prospect of people looking for the actual bill around the Capitol building this week.
But his address also laid bare his bitter partisan standoff with Democrats and left little doubt that legislative accomplishments between now and the election will be difficult, if not impossible.

The result: Large employers generally no longer offer so-called mini-med policies with very skimpy benefits.
Hillary Clinton laid out her economic plan on Monday at a rally in Cincinnati. She appeared with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a hero to progressives who has stood up to bank executives and called for lower student debt.
I think at this point it's really about money. Time is one thing. Paid leave, having a few weeks off, even having 12 weeks off, which the federal government offered to some employees last year, though that's expired — that's helpful. But the pandemic has lasted a lot more than 12 weeks. To me, if an employer gives money, then the employee can choose to use that to take an unpaid leave, or to hire a babysitter, or to help compensate a grandparent or an aunt or uncle who's helping, or to hire a tutor and make their own personal family decisions about what's best for their child. But again, very few employers are doing this. The ones that are are mostly the higher paying ones that employ people with college degrees or higher. So it's really reflecting a lot of the inequities that we see in all parts of our culture, which is that people with college degrees and high earners are treated a lot better at work.
MARTIN: NPR's Mara Liasson, thank you. We appreciate it.
We all understand what it will mean for our daughters and granddaughters when Hillary Clinton walks into the Oval Office as president of the United States of America, Biden said. It will change their lives. My daughters and granddaughters can do anything any son or grandson can do, and she will prove it.
Donald Trump keeps saying he'll keep American manufacturing jobs from going overseas. We're going to talk now with a former Michigan governor who knows how hard that can be. Jennifer Granholm led the state from 2003 to 2011 during the height of the economic recession. In 2009, the unemployment rate in Michigan topped 14 percent - the worst in the country.
But in the era of Trump, what it means to be on the right is changing, and the Koch network's tactics are changing to reflect new realities.
For the sticks part of the plan, Rieder proposes that richer nations do away with tax breaks for having children and actually penalize new parents. He says the penalty should be progressive, based on income, and could increase with each additional child.
Trump's suits were made in Mexico. He could've had them made in Brooklyn [or] Ohio. Trump Furniture is made in Turkey, instead of Cleveland. Trump Barware is made in Slovenia, instead of Toledo.
And we're basically locked down outside of doing the daily walk, he said.
LISA GRAVES: In February, in Charlotte the City Council passed a measure to provide protections for members of the LGBTQ community. And the minute the City Council passed that measure, the governor and the Legislature basically said that were going to block it, or in other words, preempt it. A month later, on March 22, the state Legislature entered into a special session.
MOORE: So we think we can get the cost down to $3 trillion or so over 10 years. Now, look, we're talking about out of 40 or $50 trillion of, you know, of federal budget over that period. So it sounds like a large number, but we're dealing with really large numbers here, number one. Number two, there is a spending cut component. And, you know, conservatives like me want to see the federal budget cut. We want to see the inefficiencies and the waste and the abuses of the system reduced. But I want to circle back to this point 'cause I think it's the heart of what we have to do as a nation.
KELLY: Trump's proposals came under fire from critics on the left and the right, who say the plan would increase the federal deficit by about $10 trillion over the next decade. Now Trump is tweaking his plan, and he's called some prominent conservative thinkers to help him out, including Stephen Moore. He's a founder of the conservative super PAC, Club for Growth. He's now at The Heritage Foundation. We asked him to drop by to talk about what he is advising Trump to do.
In other words, not all dollars are created equal. Imagine a rich woman and a poor woman. The rich woman has a marginal tax rate of 40 percent — she gives up 40 cents of her last dollar of income. The poor woman, meanwhile, gives up 10 cents. (For simplicity's sake, we're assuming no tax credits or deductions here.)
If it results in something positive, that's great, he says. But that's just a different question from whether the person who is doing the giving is doing something that you admire or not.
Those extra safeguards, along with efforts to educate taxpayers about scams, have helped the IRS beat back thieves trying to defraud individuals.
But the housing crash in 2008 wiped out her parents' savings and their small business. So to get her college degree at a public university, Erica wound up $100,000 in debt. We cannot let this student debt crisis continue; we have got to give hard-working students and families relief.
(Reading) In the cold, nearly colorless light of a New England winter, two men on horseback traveled the East Coast road below Boston, heading north. Nothing about the harsh landscape differed from other winters, nor was there anything to distinguish the two riders. It might have been any year, and it could have been anybody braving the weather for any number of reasons, dressed as they were in heavy cloaks, their hats pulled low against the wind.
She says she's certain she was exposed at the nursing home since, at the time, she wasn't seeing anyone outside of work or shopping in stores, and she'd even moved out of her house and into an apartment to avoid bringing the virus home to her wife. Thinking back, Pineau-Chaisson wonders if she was sweating too much, which made it harder for her mask to work well. Or, perhaps, she got too close while trying to facilitate the FaceTime calls.
DOUCLEFF: Yeah, yeah. It is significant when you - when the CDC also says that it's going to grow, right? This thing is getting worse. They actually - one of the health officials I talked to said that it's accelerating, so...
Asked specifically whether he plans to make Trump's tax returns a top priority, Jeffries responded with a different list of legislative goals like lowering health care costs, introducing an infrastructure plan and cleaning up corruption.
Masket said the other way to view a primary is as a political party making its most important decision: whom to choose for its nominee.
INSKEEP: We just got a moment left. Cokie Roberts, how does all of this affect what is only in theory a different matter, the nomination of Merrick Garland to the United States Supreme Court which President Obama sent to the Senate?
CORNISH: And also, you're going to be very disappointed (laughter).
President Donald Trump has unleashed American growth at a pace the experts thought was not possible, approaching 3% real GDP growth in 2018, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement. An America First agenda that prioritizes American jobs, American workers, and American industry instead of burdensome regulation and unfair trade deals has revitalized the American economy. America is back.
RASCOE: Well, many of the candidates were basically saying that it's time for the U.S. to get out of Afghanistan - that the war has gone on too long. In particular, Warren said that she would pull out the troops even without a deal.
KHALID: In the 2018 midterms, Brown won Ohio by nearly 7 points. In 2016, Hillary Clinton lost the state by about 8 points. Brown's logic is that if he can win Ohio, then he could also win nearby states that are more liberal, like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. And if he can do that, then he could win the White House. Asma Khalid, NPR News.
Watching it all can seem like two parallel universes. Americans are getting their information about the trial from vastly different sources.
I believe with this administration, it will be permanent, DeLauro said. I believe that [this bill] will be an indelible mark, and we will move forward.
We're not touching Medicare, we want to keep Medicare, we're not touching Social Security, Trump told governors at the White House on Monday. We're not decreasing Medicaid but we're doing a lot of things that are very good including [addressing] waste and fraud, he said.
But ever since winning the party's nomination last spring amid the onset of the global pandemic and economic downturn, Biden has vowed to govern as the most progressive president since Franklin Roosevelt. He's even made a large portrait of FDR the centerpiece of his Oval Office to underscore that goal.
That doesn't mean they give Trump credit, though. Joyce Delk, who knocked doors for Biden in South Carolina last week, gives him some credit for today's economy.
ROVNER: That's exactly right. The computer can't process it.
It doesn't make sense when corporations stash their profits overseas or send them to influential shareholders, instead of making long-term investments in raising wages, training and research. Or when governors and legislatures use every trick in the book to weaken unions and make it harder for Americans to organize themselves for better wages and benefits.
PATZER: Yeah. I think a lot of people are making sacrifices right now in their personal lives. And I think thinking about the additional sacrifices that health care workers and first responders and others that are still working and have to continue, you know, working in our society and helping to minimize the demand on the health care system - that we really need to, you know, listen to public health and medical advice. We need to stay home. We need to listen to the public health advice to do as much as we can to protect the community and minimize the demand on the health care system.
Republicans have been especially critical of the $70 billion the federal government spends each year on food stamps, now called the supplemental nutrition assistance program, or SNAP, although Trump has yet to say what he'd like to do about it.
And I have to say as a Republican it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you.
In this race for the White House, I am the Law And Order candidate.
And Biden has an added challenge: convincing people in communities of color and, especially, Republicans to take it, even when there are enough vaccines for everyone. COVID-19 politics are real, as Trump downplayed the importance of wearing masks and the threat of the virus overall.
Rep. John Faso On GOP Tax Bill
Ferorelli, 33, and Kallman, 32, are both in committed relationships, and in the throes of this problem. Ferorelli recently helped her widowed mother pack up her house, saving cherished items with the unspoken assumption that they are for a next generation.
What does $400 million mean in someone's daily life when they cannot even get $2 a day?
--15 percent business rate: The headline is a 15 percent business tax rate. That cuts the corporate tax rate down from 35 percent.
That's because, Malkus says, if this move entices lots of new families to sign up and many current families to contribute more, then states could end up losing a lot more money to tax breaks.
Back in Washington, after the original comments, Spicer said, I don't think our job right now is to roll something out and/or be prescriptive; it's to show that there are ways the wall can be paid for. Full stop.
The final key part of Trump's speech will focus on national security, including efforts to rebuild the military and deal with foreign threats such as ISIS — another effort where he has received positive marks from Americans — North Korea and others.
CHARTS: See How Much Of GOP Tax Cuts Will Go To The Middle Class
PAUL CARANCI: It's my pleasure. Thank you for having me on.
Many Italians blame the education system, which is chronically underfunded, and favors theory over practice, leading to a very slow school-to-work transition, and to a mismatch between what young people graduate in and the skills needed to find work.
In September, The New York Times published an investigation citing tax documents it obtained, reporting that Trump had paid just $750 in federal income tax in 2016 and 2017, and no income taxes in 10 of the previous 15 years while reporting significant business losses. Trump, who had previously bragged about not paying taxes, denied the report.
The choice between plans and doctors, which is cited as a benefit of the current market-based system, often doesn't seem an asset to small restaurateurs and their workers.
BOOKER: It was a guy in Oklahoma, and he got sentenced to 30 years. And he said no, I want 33 'cause he said if I was going to go down, he was going to go down in Larry Bird's jersey number. All right, you still have two more chances here, senator.
HORSLEY: Yeah. This is the kind of reassuring message you want to hear from the treasury secretary at a time like this. Of course, Steven Mnuchin is also the fellow who continues to insist to this day that the GOP tax cut is going to pay for itself. So he may have squandered some credibility here. He is right that this is not like the financial crisis. This is a different kind of economic threat.
SANDERS: Yes. Look; the first thing we have to recognize is that our criminal justice system is not just broken. It is deeply, deeply, deeply broken. It is a dysfunctional system, which is punishing millions of people unnecessarily. So the first point I think we have to focus on is why it is that we are spending $80 billion a year - $80 billion a year to lock up over 2 million Americans, which is more people behind bars in America than any other country on Earth, including China, a communist, authoritarian nation. So something is fundamentally flawed.
KELLY: And, Steven and Ben, a quick reaction from each of you on that. How much of this in your state is real policy proposal? How much is for show?
Democratic Candidates Were Less Than Welcoming To Michael Bloomberg
That approach didn't endear Flake to the conservative base in his home state, and he faced a very real possibility of being defeated in the GOP primary. But Flake announced at the end of October he wouldn't run for re-election. In doing so, he gave a scathing speech on the Senate floor about the current state of politics and the flagrant disregard for truth or decency.
But the correct Cohen's attorneys also acknowledged some of the material Avenatti released was legitimate, raising questions about how he was getting non-public, confidential financial records and then putting them out in the open.

Trump does talk a lot about how drug prices have gone down during his presidency, citing the consumer price index, though many fact-checkers have pointed out that it is an imperfect measure and that drug spending overall has continued to climb. — Selena Simmons-Duffin
MAYER: You know - absolutely. And Alec MacGillis' book is wonderful. Winning - he just plain wants to win. He wants to be in power. John Yarmuth, who is a congressman from Louisville, Ky., who's known McConnell for almost since the beginning of McConnell's career. And Yarmuth is a Democrat now. He used to be a Republican, but he's known McConnell really well. And he said McConnell doesn't want to do anything. He just wants to be something. He wants to be majority leader. He wants to have the power. But he really - governing isn't that much of interest to him. It's about winning.
The White House showed no indication Monday that the president was considering changing his mind. The president is resolute about this, and no one should be surprised either at that resoluteness or the fact that it's going to happen, said National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro, a top Trump aide who, along with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, has been the strongest administration advocate for new tariffs.
He said that at the president's direction, we are moving Tax Day from April 15 to July 15.

Gutierrez, whose family lives in Albuquerque, would be eligible for financial assistance to help her buy into the Medicaid-like plan, while her husband stays on his employer plan. Because their $46,000 annual income is just above 150 percent of the federal poverty level, her monthly premium would likely be about $160 per month for a comprehensive plan with a $150 deductible, according to estimates by Manatt Health, which did the original state analyses of buy-in options that were published before the bills were introduced in January.
Durham, meanwhile, was appointed in October by then-Attorney General William Barr as special counsel to investigate the origins of the Russia probe.

If you haven't heard, Joe Biden would like to unite America.
Right off the bat, Trump calls for the elimination of the Affordable Care Act, ringing the repeal bell that has been popular among a wide swath of Republicans and that has fueled dozens of votes to overturn Obamacare in Congress, including another failed attempt when lawmakers reconvened first thing in January.
I guess I really don't understand why the government hasn't stepped in and done a little bit more, because it would benefit them too, he says. Any extra money we'd get, we'd be taxed on.
O'Brien agrees that it would take an enormous amount of political will among the world's leaders. But he is optimistic about the odds. Major agencies like the International Monetary Fund are discussing the need for it, whereas less than 10 years ago, he was told at the World Economic Forum that it would never even become the subject of public conversation.
Also working against Republicans is Gov. Sam Brownback's unpopularity in the state, and Thompson has tried to tie Estes to the governor.

Biden's speech was not just on the one-year anniversary of the coronavirus crisis being declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, but it also came on the same day Biden signed a massive $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan into law.
If Our Economy Is So Great, Why Did The Fed Vote To Juice It?
This contest on Tuesday is giving Republicans some late heartburn, as they're worried about a low-turnout contest, a depressed GOP base and an underperforming nominee.
STEIN: Yeah, yeah. The number of people getting infected, sick and dying would slowly but pretty steadily continue dropping from here on out because of the vaccines, the fact that a chunk of the country already has some immunity, the weather's getting warmer, which will slow the virus, and life could slowly but steadily return to something much more normal.

But the trade war isn't over. The vast majority of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods remain, about $370 billion worth of goods. So this is just a pause.
Even after accounting for withholding, some people are paying more in taxes. Kaeding said people who saw their taxes increase tend to be high earners in areas with higher state and local taxes.
So in the eleventh hour, Republicans are now sending in their cavalry. The National Republican Congressional Committee went up with an ad last week hitting Democratic nominee James Thompson on his position on abortion rights, Vice President Pence has recorded a robo-call on Estes' behalf and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — who won Kansas big in the state's presidential caucuses last year — will campaign with Estes on Monday.
Since before Trump was elected in 2016, Democrats have been trying to pressure him to release his tax returns in hopes of illuminating possible business relationships or sources of income from foreign powers, including Russia.
MARTIN: So we knew gender was going to come up because of this kerfuffle between Sanders and Warren, right?

This is the highest, best use of my own set of skills to pay back.
One theoretical justification for temporary expensing is that if you're in a recession and investment is really low relative to what the economy's potential should be, Goldwein said. A. That would justify a one-year policy, not a five-year policy. And B. I'm not sure you've seen the employment numbers, but we're at full employment. The unemployment rate for October was 4.1 percent, a 17-year low.
President Trump spent much of the week threatening leaders of Guatemala. And yesterday, he got what he wanted.

She joins us now from Mexico City. Carrie, thanks so much for being with us.

COHN: I do think we'll get there eventually. I think it will take time. You know, the people who wrote the Affordable Care Act, certainly were trying to get to universal health care. That's what they believed. And I think they would see and I would agree that it's a big step on the road towards universal health care, both in the sense that we've covered many more people. So the number of people who don't have insurance at this point is much lower than it was.
As you know, the media has constantly asserted the outrageous lie that there was no evidence of widespread fraud. Have you ever seen these people? While there is no evidence of fraud. Oh, really?

Previous government shutdowns usually ended after a few days. This one has now gone on longer - a lot longer. It's now at record length.

And if progressives aren't quite ready to exert their will on the Biden administration by stalling the president's priorities in Congress, they're making it clear that without big tactical changes like eliminating the legislative filibuster, Biden and the rest of the party might suffer consequences in the midterm elections next year and in 2024.

GALSTON: The law applies to churches and all other federally designated charities. There has been enforcement in the areas other than churches. The IRS has been reluctant to enforce against the churches for a number of reasons. You can consult them, but it seems obvious that when they attempted to enforce the prohibition, they got a lot of pushback from members of Congress. That doesn't make it legal. It just means that churches are doing it with impunity at the moment.

I can't understand why nobody has asked the president about this, said James Gelfand, the top health policy official at ERIC, a lobbying group of very large employers focused on benefits and pay.

Already House leaders have introduced a series of amendments to the bill aimed at bringing on board reluctant Republicans. The amendments, announced last night, cut taxes on the wealthy that were put in place by the Affordable Care Act a year sooner, give states the option of imposing work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients, and offer more generous reimbursement for elderly and disabled people on Medicaid (while still freezing and rolling back the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act).
They said it could take two weeks to 10 months — and many times they'll deny you the first time, says Pineau-Chaisson.

Congressional Democrats are already hoping to make the child subsidy payment permanent. Cox says there's ample evidence kids who get that kind of early support are healthier, do better in school and earn more money as adults.
And I think that that's a significant flaw here. And it will wind up in states like New York, which regrettably are a - is a high tax state - I fear what it will do is accelerate the existing trend of successful people and their businesses leaving New York. It's already happening. If you take away this deductability, it'll accelerate it.
Pence created an agency that was dedicated to suspending the creation of all new regulations except for public health and safety. And it was a sort of an independent agency of its own. He did that at the state level. At the federal level, my understanding based on everybody I've spoken to is that it's more likely that he will try to do this through personnel, so, for instance, by appointing people at the top of the agencies - that the people he puts there could have a pretty dramatic effect on slowing down or stalling the creation of new regulations or rolling back things that are already in place.
Amid Talk Of Tariffs, What Happens To Companies That Straddle The Border?

GREEN: Well, yeah, I certainly did when I was in school. My parents were really, really good about that sort of thing. But really, it was the combination of seeing all the great customer research that I had access to when I was at Intuit, but also at the same time getting exposed to the work of folks like Daniel Kahneman, who's a cognitive scientist, wrote a great book called Thinking, Fast and Slow, that sort of changed my thinking about how to build things. But also the work of a number of behavioral economists and I just - I'm one of those guys that reads a lot of stuff, and so some day I just put those two things together in a kind of strange way and realized that no one had built technology that was supposed to help me with my money decisions when I was actually making them.
MORRIS: Katherine Smith Evans ran the Economic Research Service during parts of the George W. Bush and Obama administrations. She says more than half the employees quit rather than uproot their families and move.
In his old plan, Trump had said pass-through businesses would be taxed at 15 percent, the same as the corporate tax rate he is proposing. However, since Trump released the new version of this plan, his campaign has given two different explanations about how that income would be taxed: one saying it would be 15 percent; the other saying it would be at individual rates, as the New York Times' Binyamin Appelbaum has reported.
RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. This week I'm calling in from Philadelphia, Pa. - happens to be the home base for Biden's 2020 campaign.
All taxpayers and businesses will have this additional time to file and make payments without interest or penalties, Mnuchin added.
LIASSON: Well, I think that clip played it all, you know. We have said it all. We've seen a lot of different types of Joe Biden speeches - some of them are rambly (ph), some of them are shouty. But this one was purposefully calm, sending a very clear message in a crisis. He's going to give a whole speech tomorrow on the coronavirus. But that speech was meant to stand out as a contrast to Donald Trump's sometimes chaotic leadership style. The speech was calm, purposely steady and serious.
They can also celebrate it. WASH United, an international NGO dedicated to issues of water, sanitation and hygiene, launched Menstrual Hygiene Day in 2014. Kenya marked the occasion with a public event for thousands of schoolchildren. (You can read an account in this issue of Shared Sanitation, Hygiene, Information and Tales.)
Some elements of this proposal already exist in the bill that the Senate is negotiating.

CLINTON: He would undermine the growth that we've had since the Great Recession. One independent expert - actually, the economist who advised John McCain in 2008, so, you know, not somebody that has any predisposition toward our side - but this economist did a study. He said under Trump's economic plans, we would lose in America 3 and a half million jobs.
I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania, and New York, and Michigan, and all of America – and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequence. Not going to happen anymore.
It would bring us peace of mind not having to worry about our health care situation, Blanca says through an interpreter.

GameStop's stock symbol is GME. On Reddit, one member of wallstreetbets, wrote early Thursday: GME is about sending a message. ... For all the recessions they caused. For all the jobs and homes people have lost. For all the people that can't pay for college because minimum wage has stagnated while wall street gets rich. For all the retail traders they left holding the bag. For all the times they got bailed out with our tax money while we got nothing.
If this happened to the Democrats, there'd be hell all over the country going on. There'd be hell all over the country.

House lawmakers Wednesday gave final approval to President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, sending the legislation to his desk for his signature. The White House says Biden plans to sign it on Friday.
Still, the numbers show a clear softening of growth over the year.
The House and Senate approved the agreement with large, bipartisan majorities and Trump signed the authorizing legislation at the end of January. While Mexico has approved the deal, it still needs final approval from Canada. The USMCA requires automakers to include more North American content in their cars and trucks to qualify for duty-free status, and a minimum wage provision that could result in some auto production shifting from Mexico to the U.S. It also gives U.S. dairy farmers slightly more access to the Canadian market. House Democrats and the AFL-CIO say they pushed the administration to include stronger labor and environmental protections.

She hopes that this may soon change. Identical bills proposed in recent weeks in the New Mexico House and Senate would make Gutierrez eligible to buy into a public health plan modeled on the Medicaid program, with funding support from the state of New Mexico. She could receive state-funded assistance via the program that would save her hundreds of dollars a month on premiums.

Originally from Seattle, McElroy, 45, has lived in London for almost 20 years. A stand-up comedian, he's made a career out of poking fun at the differences in the ways Americans versus Britons see the world — and one of the biggest differences is their outlook on health care.
Because low-income families are more likely to spend the extra money, it's expected to provide a significant lift to the broader economy.
Emails released Friday show that Christa Jones — a longtime Census Bureau employee who currently serves as the chief of staff to the bureau's deputy director, Ron Jarmin — had been in contact with Hofeller as early as 2010, using both her official Census Bureau email address and a Hotmail address. In a January 2015 email, Jones sent a link to a Federal Register notice that asked for public comments ahead of a field test of potential changes to census questions.
He covers the whole region, and finds the situation in Iraq the one that really is probably most alarming in terms of its potential for destabilization.
Unfortunately, I feel the efforts to 'fix' the background check system will be really efforts to gut the background check system, Winkler says. To make it less effective, less streamlined, and make it harder for prosecutors to find gun criminals. That's been the NRA's practice with regard to background checks in the past.
Still, the tax credit may be appealing to companies that have already been leaning toward adding a paid family and medical leave benefit, says Rich Fuerstenberg, a senior partner at Mercer, a benefits consulting firm.

[That's roughly true, by the latest data available. Around 11 million Hispanic-Americans were in poverty in 2008, compared with 13.1 million in 2014. The poverty rate makes more sense to compare, though — that has grown 0.4 points since 2008, but it has also declined lately, down by nearly 3 points since 2010. As for whether President Obama is responsible for this, we get to that below. — Danielle Kurtzleben]
This will have a huge impact on state-run 529 plans. And for states that offer a tax deduction, a major impact on state tax receipts, says Michael Frerichs, who is Illinois' state treasurer.
But if he does benefit from that law, I mean that would potentially be a lot of money for him. I mean he - you know, capital gains tax, if you're a New York state resident, is going to be 30 percent of the profit of what you make in a sale. So that could really be something that ultimately works in his favor.
Under the Senate version that Biden signed, federal unemployment insurance payments will remain at $300 per week — down from $400 per week in the earlier package passed by the House. The benefits will extend through Sept. 6. The Senate's bill makes the first $10,200 in unemployment payments nontaxable for households with incomes under $150,000.
In early April, media organizations around the world reported that millions of documents were hacked from Mossack Fonseca, a Panama law firm that helps set up offshore shelters for wealthy clients, many of which are used for tax avoidance and hiding assets.
Lots of folks who started out in this campaign had good ideas - people like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker and Julian Castro and Kirsten Gillibrand, people who brought good, vibrant ideas and got squeezed out because of money. I try to incorporate their ideas, incorporate their people. We've hired a lot of staffers from those campaigns and brought in a lot of volunteers because we need to be a Democratic Party that embraces ideas, and those ideas should be the ideas that help working people. That's my life's work, and that's why I'm in the fight.
This will produce more than $20 trillion in job-creating economic activity over the next four decades. My opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and the great steelworkers of our country out of work and out of business – that will never happen with Donald J Trump as president. Our steelworkers and our miners are going back to work again.
And then some of this was, frankly, just about opposing the Democrats, opposing Obama. And, you know, that's a whole other conversation - well, why was the opposition to Obama so intense? - and something I try to talk about in the book. But I always say, you know, I'm not surprised that Republicans generally opposed, you know, the Affordable Care Act. I'm surprised they all did. I'm surprised they did so intensely. And it's just hard to escape the idea that the opposition to Obamacare was as much about the Obama part as it was about the care part.

This is one of 16 meetings over the past year and a half organized by Conceivable Future, a nonprofit founded on the notion that the climate crisis is a reproductive crisis.
One nonpartisan expert at the Tax Policy Center described this plan as, quote, a really nice deal... for Donald Trump. Of course, it's hard to say how nice, because he refuses to do what every other Presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns.
SCHNEIDER: Fullerton says El Paso's economy as a whole should be able to absorb the hit, but it will be a hard blow for individual retailers who depend heavily on back-to-school sales. Add to that recurring long lines at the border crossing and the weakness of the peso, and that may further discourage Mexican shoppers in the coming months. For NPR News, I'm Andrew Schneider in El Paso.
Jim Warren, a gaming industry consultant hired by Torstar, told the CBC that it's not yet known how much revenue the online gaming business would generate.

Persuading one company to keep a thousand jobs in the U.S. is one thing. Crafting (and passing) an actual policy to persuade many companies to stay in the U.S. is another.
Next, I will ask each and every federal agency to prepare a list of all of the regulations they impose on Americans which are not necessary, do not improve public safety, and which needlessly kill many many jobs. Those regulations will be eliminated quickly. We are in a competition with the world, and I want America to win. We don't win anymore. But when I am president, we will start winning again, big league.

This is very easy, Winkler says. Allowing carrying of firearms on military bases is something that the president will probably be able to do through executive order. I believe that [Trump] will.
Elementary and secondary schools: Over $128 billion in grants to state educational agencies, with 90% allocated to local educational agencies.
The agencies have been decimated. Their ability to perform the functions they were created to perform – it doesn't exist anymore, Evans says.
That film, A Fine Line, began as a love letter to her mom, chronicling the difficulties Val James overcame — from finding bank loans to babysitters — as she established her own restaurant in the early 1990s in central Massachusetts. Eventually the documentary grew into a much bigger story filled with dozens of additional voices from across the industry.
We will also help cities like Detroit and Flint connect underserved neighborhoods to opportunity, expanding affordable housing, and repair schools and failing water systems as well.
The bill would provide financial assistance from the state, with premiums and cost sharing for people whose incomes are less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or $60,340 for a family of five. The new coverage would take effect by January 2021.
GREENE: Well, as I mentioned, I mean, a historically bad day on Wall Street, and you had Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin speaking yesterday, briefing reporters about the coronavirus and trying to reassure investors. Let's listen here.
Marijuana legalization wasn't supposed to look like this.
Last week's challenge, from Ken Stern of Brooklyn, N.Y.: Think of a sign that's frequently seen around this time of year — two words of four letters each. Among these eight letters all five vowels — A, E, I, O and U — appear once each, along with three consonants. What sign is it?
You know, I read a story in one of the newspapers recently how I control the three Supreme Court justices. I control them. They're puppets.
MARTIN: You mean regulatory actions or executive orders?
Pennsylvania is the only gas-producing state to charge an impact fee rather than a severance tax, which would be levied on the amount of gas produced. Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, has repeatedly proposed a severance tax he says would raise badly needed revenue for education and other items, but he has been rebuffed by the Republican-controlled legislature. His current proposal is to use a severance tax to pay for $4.5 billion in infrastructure improvements.
Summers also warned that deficit-financed spending now on a short-term relief package could make it harder for the Biden administration to find money later for long-term investments in things like infrastructure.
The health and safety of the Lyft community is our top priority, and we're dedicated to doing what we can to slow the spread of COVID-19, Lyft said via Twitter.
The state Religious Freedom Restoration Act, as it is known, turned off suburban and college-educated voters, says pollster Matthews, and sent the state's business leaders through the roof. Among those business executives was Angie's List co-founder Bill Oesterle, a longtime Republican activist, who threatened to abandon a major expansion of his company in the state.
The substance on the deficit is this: In the most recent four fiscal years, the federal government spent roughly between $400 billion and $600 billion more than it took in every year. In September, the U.S. national debt crossed a staggering $20 trillion mark for the first time.
Hillary is tough, she said. Hillary is courageous. She will fight to make our families safer. In the White House she will stand up to the gun lobby; that is why I am voting for Hillary. Speaking is difficult for me, but come January I want to say these two words: Madame President.
The pandemic is dealing fresh blows to the U.S. economy, with more than 1.2 million Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits in the first week of the new year.
Senate Democrats and the White House also agreed to keep a provision that would increase federal unemployment benefits to $400 per week through the end of August.
Democrats are hoping to prove that the growing opposition to President Trump is very real with an upset in one — or possibly even two — upcoming special congressional elections.
STEVEN MNUCHIN: We have to do this now. The president has instructed me that this is no fault to American workers. For medical reasons, we are shutting down parts of this economy. And we're going to use all the tools we have, as I've said. And what tools we don't have, we're going back to Congress.
Another key point of contention had been the timeline for legalizing possession. Democrats in the Senate had pushed for legalizing possession of small amounts by the summer, the Associated Press reports. House Democrats argued that doing so without regulations in place could prop up black market sales.
I think a lot of us started to see, 'well shoot, if West Virginia can do it, North Carolina can do it,'  she told NPR's Ari Shapiro. If Oklahoma can do it, North Carolina can do it. If Arizona can do it, so can North Carolina.
But such progress is not inevitable. It is the result of choices we make together. And we face such choices right now. Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, and turning against each other as a people? Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, what we stand for, and the incredible things we can do together?
Protesters took to the streets for the third night Wednesday in towns and cities across Tunisia, demonstrating against recently imposed price hikes on common goods.
I'm telling you, that's what I believe will happen, he said. I'm not going to tell you I'm sure.

I would not figuratively but literally leave the keys on the desk, the lights will get turned off when the power doesn't get paid. And that's it, he said, dangling his office keys and dropping them on his desk for emphasis. The state could come in and run [the city] because the revenue would not be here to provide the basic services.
And he's been trying to present starker contrasts between himself and Biden - you know, pointing out that they have different views on trade, which, again, is a particularly salient issue in the manufacturing-heavy state of Michigan. You know, he also needs to chip away, though, at Biden's strength with black voters. And that is going to be difficult.

A better politics doesn't mean we have to agree on everything. This is a big country, with different regions and attitudes and interests. That's one of our strengths, too. Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government, and expected us to argue, just as they did, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security.
And I say this despite all that's happened. The best is yet to come.
It's unknown whether the backers of the ballot measure would continue to press the issue if the legislature passes the compromise bill instead of the full state-run benefit advocates sought.

Robert Bozick, a RAND demographer who's helping to lead the think tank's work for the count, acknowledges it is a potentially politically thorny project given the high stakes. Next year, California could lose a congressional seat for the first time in the state's history, a recent projection by the political consulting firm Election Data Services found.
While there is no specific tax on tampons, in states that don't tax medical and health supplies, tampons are excluded from those tax-exempt categories. Hence the term tampon tax.

It seems yet another glitch is forcing a delay in a piece of the health law. This time it's how much more insurers can charge smokers. Coupled with last week's announcements of other delays, could there be trouble ahead for the law?
So what was happening in the 1960s? One thing was that the parties were loosening their grip on one of their major functions: nominating candidates. Primaries existed then, but before the 1960s, delegates would go to the national party conventions without knowing exactly who would be the nominee. It wasn't the coronation ceremony it is today.
The lawsuit could easily go all the way to the Supreme Court before there is a resolution, which could take years. So the pre-existing condition protections are likely to stay in place during that period.

Donald Trump wants America to work for him and his friends, at the expense of everyone else.
The risk to the average American of contracting the coronavirus remains low, Pence said. The risk to senior citizens with serious underlying chronic health conditions is very significant.
This change allows private school families to put their money through 529 accounts and avoid state income taxes, says Nat Malkus, who studies education policy at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank. It is a mess, no matter how you slice it. It's a change from the federal level that puts a number of states in a pretty tough position moving forward.
There may be cases where we can appropriately advocate for issues directly related to our journalistic mission (e.g. First Amendment rights, the Freedom of Information Act, a federal shield law). It also may be appropriate to donate money or time to organizations that advocate on such issues.
Unlike states, the territories do not have a vote in Congress. They each send a delegate to the House who possesses all powers of a representative besides voting rights, like the ability to debate legislation or sit on committees.
The foundation also didn't used to be so polarizing. Plenty of Republicans have spoken at the Clinton Global Initiative, including Mitt Romney just 42 days before the 2012 election.

These businesses have been particularly hard hit by recent events, but under President Trump's leadership we are taking swift action to assist hard hit producers and deliver strong returns to the taxpayer, says Brouillette.
There was a lot of hope that we were going to get a big tax reform; there was a lot of hope that we were going to get fiscal expansion in the form of government spending on infrastructure and consumer spending fueled by tax cuts, Nordvig says.
Importantly, it's a nonbinding resolution, meaning that even if it were to pass (more on the challenges to that below), it wouldn't itself create any new programs. Instead, it would potentially affirm the sense of the House that these things should be done in the coming years.

Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George says that government anti-fraud efforts, such as working with telephone companies to shut down scammers' phone numbers, are increasingly effective.

Clashes between demonstrators and security forces have taken place in at least 20 cities and towns, The Guardian reports. Khalifa Chibani, spokesman for Tunisia's interior ministry, told Tunisia's TAP news agency that at least 58 members of the security forces have been injured and 57 police vehicles damaged, according to The Associated Press.

But others say the legal brief may have minimal impact next year on premiums. That's because insurers already expected the Trump administration would not defend the ACA — and they know that a resolution of the case will be years away, says industry consultant Robert Laszewski.

But while the exchange may have been attractive to many consumers, it was less appealing to insurers. Two of the four original insurance companies in the marketplace are no longer in it. Now, with an uncertain future ahead, Access Health CT CEO Jim Wadleigh says he has one hard goal in mind as he thinks beyond 2017: What can we do to help make the business environment that our carriers are in easier for them to be more successful?
Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who served in different positions in the Clinton and Obama administrations, has been one of the most prominent Democratic critics of the plan.

Then there's the chicken-in-every-pot plank that would require providers of health care to disclose prices. Individuals should be able to shop to find the best prices for procedures, exams or any other medical-related procedure, the Trump proposal says. Not many people disagree with the intent. But it's difficult to pull off in a way that helps the average person shop. Health care prices are negotiated between insurers and providers, and people's coverage and copays vary depending on their networks and insurance particulars.

RASCOE: This issue of the buybacks is - it's a tricky issue. And it may be why O'Rourke is so out on this, and other people may not be joining him - is because NPR had a poll - the NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll that came out earlier this week. And what they found was that support for actual buybacks is really mixed.
The agenda will test the party's commitment to small government and a fiscal conservatism that in recent years has rejected any new spending without corresponding cuts in the federal budget.

Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning. The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over – at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, at a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. And many many other locations.
Congress has passed temporary tax changes as a way to jolt the economy to life before. Holtz-Eakin pointed to a reduction in payroll taxes that lasted from 2011 to 2013, as the economy struggled back from a deep recession. That was passed explicitly as a way to temporarily boost a weak economy, but when it expired, working Americans still experienced it as a tax increase. So a fight over extending it became a big part of the already contentious fiscal cliff debate that took place at the end of 2012.
SANDERS: The other area that we have to look at - you talk to anybody who knows anything about criminology or penology and what they will tell you - that a significant number of people in jail today are in jail because they are suffering from addiction. It's drug addiction. It is alcohol addiction.
The longtime Russian leader is currently limited by a Russian constitution that does not allow a president to serve more than two terms in a row. Previously, Putin sidestepped those term limits by sliding into the role of prime minister from 2008 to 2012, handpicking Medvedev to succeed him in office while still retaining much of his power behind the scenes.

And there's also been pushback. Bail reforms in Alaska and New York were rolled back or amended. In California, a ballot measure kept cash bail intact. In Illinois, there was strong opposition from the Illinois Law Enforcement Coalition, a group of police unions and organizations representing police officers and county sheriffs.
But is it a good idea? That debate has been raging since last year, when Warren first unveiled her plan. One critique, from Adam Looney of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, says Warren's plan would disproportionately benefit the wealthy, with the bottom 20% of borrowers by income reaping just 4% of the savings. As such, Looney asks: Why are those who went to college more deserving of aid than those who didn't?
When you have conversations with conservatives talking about tax policy a lot are in favor of cutting taxes, the government taking less of a person's money. But when you start paying money back to people, particularly poor people, some people have a really strong, visceral reaction to that. What are the politics of this?
We are going to reduce taxes ... for the middle class in particular but for our companies.
Romney cited three instances in Trump's first two years as president in which he disapproved of how the president conducted himself: his response to the racist violence in Charlottesville, Va.; his support of Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate who was accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls while he was an adult; and Trump's continued vitriolic attacks on the media.
After a couple days, he wanted him to go ahead with it, so they did. They put U.S. aircraft on course to fly towards the Soviet Union armed with nuclear weapons just as - essentially as a gesture. And there was an after action report later that described that exercise as a dangerous undertaking because there was an almost mid-air collision. So it does depend ultimately on the decisions of individuals but how they implement the president's will.
Japan's new cases include a man in his 40s who arrived at an airport near Nagoya and tested positive for the virus.

The principal ministers of the Russian government, from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on down, resigned Wednesday in a move designed to ease a constitutional overhaul recently proposed by President Vladimir Putin. The president accepted Medvedev's resignation and said he would appoint his longtime loyalist to the Russian Security Council.
Historically, few promises that presidents lay out in these speeches ever get implemented, as PBS NewsHour noted in 2015. The speeches rarely change anyone's minds, either, Gallup reported in 2010: Audiences for the State of the Union tend to be heavily tilted toward the president's existing supporters.
GREENE: Well, I have to say - I mean, with respect, Mr. Speaker - I mean, we've talked to federal workers who have never brought up politics at all - not talking about whether they're Democrats or Republicans - that have just been saying they don't have enough money to, you know, to pay the bills and they're thinking about, you know, going into the savings - college savings for their kids.

As of late Monday, West Virginia was the only state that has not reported a coronavirus case.

Larry Lyon, vice provost and dean of Baylor University's graduate school, was blunt. I've been promoting graduate education for over 20 years, he said, and the plan is probably the most serious threat to doctoral education we have ever experienced.
But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens. It doesn't work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice, or that our political opponents are unpatriotic. Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise; or when even basic facts are contested, and we listen only to those who agree with us. Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get attention. Most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn't matter; that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some narrow interest.

Anyone claiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction. What is true – and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious – is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes that started long before the Great Recession hit and haven't let up. Today, technology doesn't just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated. Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere, and face tougher competition. As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise. Companies have less loyalty to their communities. And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top.
If I had told my boyfriend at the time, 'I'm not ready to have children because I don't know what the climate's gonna be like in 50 years,' he wouldn't have understood. There's no way, says Hoskins, a 23-year-old whose red hair is twisted in a long braid.

Republican senators expressed widespread support for the concept of cash payments following the lunch with Mnuchin, but many critical details of how the money will be allocated and to whom still need to be addressed.
AUBREY: Now, between the controversy surrounding Donald Trump's comments and his declining poll numbers as you point to, there's a lot going on here. How is the Trump campaign responding?
President Trump's looming trade war has already claimed its first victim: White House economic adviser Gary Cohn.
Her office saw an uptick in appeals through the spring and summer and is anticipating more to come. 2020 has been a crazy year for a lot of people, Weber says, and the most important thing for students to do is communicate with the colleges they've applied to. Let them know, 'Hey, something's happened. Our finances are just a little bit different now. What can we do to let you know so you can take a second look?'
Another way Trump could undermine the health law would be by simply not enforcing its provisions, particularly the individual mandate that requires most people to have insurance. That requirement is supposed to ensure that healthy as well as sick people sign up, thus spreading the costs of people with high bills across a larger population. But executive branch non-enforcement could make a real difference to the vitality of the exchanges going forward, Bagley said. If healthy people don't sign up, sick people would need to pay more money for their insurance.
She spent much of the speech drawing out contrasts with Trump, portraying them as unrealistic and destructive, while describing her own proposals.
First, I want to apologize to the citizens, to young people, to partners, to my friends, everyone I've offended, everyone I've hurt and the city's image by pleading guilty and by being involved in all of this that has led me here today, Pugh says in the video, according to the Sun.
We built the Empire State Building in just one year. Isn't it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road? Trump queried. I am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve.
BIDEN: And I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion. We share a common goal. And together, we'll defeat Donald Trump.

Americans want Congress to focus on health care, not a border wall
President Trump convinced tens of millions of his followers of false claims about a stolen election and widespread fraud, none of which is true. Key members of his own administration called it the most secure election in history.
The Clintons don't directly profit from the foundation, despite Trump's accusation. Neither Bill nor Hillary Clinton draws a salary from it, according to tax documents.
It arguably laid the foundation for the Tea Party movement, which happened to spring up during the tenure of the first Black president, Barack Obama. That led to the formation of the Freedom Caucus, the block of hardline House Republicans who led to the ouster of John Boehner as speaker and culminated with Trump's election.
The Hungarian government's latest Stop Soros bills are the harshest yet. They would empower the interior minister to ban nongovernmental groups that are deemed a security risk or support immigration, while also levying a 25 percent tax on foreign donations to those supporting migration that remain open.
The better predictor for Democratic fortunes in the midterms may be Trump's approval rating, which has remained stagnant at 38 percent in this poll: 54 percent of all adults disapprove of the job he has done, including 40 percent who strongly disapprove.
But even with that backing still pending at the time, Keith Strobelt, who heads the political Rapid Response team for Local 1123, told the room, We know who we're against. He was talking about Donald Trump.
The weak Republicans, and that's it. I really believe it. I think I'm going to use the term, the weak Republicans. You've got a lot of them. And you got a lot of great ones. But you got a lot of weak ones. They've turned a blind eye, even as Democrats enacted policies that chipped away our jobs, weakened our military, threw open our borders and put America last.
This legislation is only going to promote the expansion and the jobs that come with these entrepreneurial small businesses, he said.

First lady Melania Trump then stood up and draped the prestigious medal on a blue ribbon around Limbaugh's neck. Cheers erupted in the chamber, and many Republicans stood and applauded the unexpected and emotional moment.
Covering for people on maternity leave is my bread and butter, Dougher says. She was previously a vice president at an advertising firm and finds the freedom and flexibility of contract work the best part of the job. Dougher receives health care and other benefits through her husband, with whom she often travels, and she says she'll never go back to a permanent position that doesn't allow travel flexibility. She takes inspiration from the country's most iconic TV chef. Julia Child loved doing what she was doing until she was pretty much dead, she says. I expect to be working and engaging with something as long as I can. The idea of retiring and doing nothing does not appeal to me.
And this brings us to one big reason why the term has taken off. To use the term is to point the finger. It happens when politicians define some dangerous other, whether it's Sanders' millionaire and billionaire class or Donald Trump's Washington that refuses to win anymore.

And the question is, is that because he's so insecure about his election he doesn't want to talk about anything that seems to undermine his legitimacy?

The analysis concludes that under current law, about 17 million people will buy insurance in the individual market next year, many of them outside the ACA marketplaces. If the four actions outlined in the paper are implemented, about 19 million people would buy individual insurance, the study finds.
And yet, according to a study by the Small Business Administration, less than 2 percent of millennials in 2014 were self-employed, compared with 7.6 percent of Generation Xers and 8.3 percent of baby boomers. This suggests that millennials are failing to start businesses. And in 2015, the Brookings Institution reported steady declines in new business formation over the past decade. According to research by the Kaufman Foundation, young people accounted for 23 percent of new entrepreneurs in 2013, down from 35 percent in 1996. Clearly, millennials are failing to live up to their entrepreneurial reputation.

GINGRICH: Look. Let's assume you have a system where there are large blocs of power that don't particularly want to change, and they don't particularly want to move. And so if they can, they're going to resist whatever you're doing. And the two ways, historically, were - well, there are three ways of really changing. One is somebody runs a campaign in which they win such a clear public will that the Congress and the president get something done. Reagan, in his first two years, for example. The second way things change is you have a genuine crisis - 9/11. The world was different by the evening of 9/11, and people responded for about a year. I mean, there was a real bipartisan effort, a real wake-up call.

Democrats, meanwhile, look at the actual content of this bill, and they salivate. They see that, you know - at least for the House bill, more than 80 percent of this tax cut goes to corporations and wealthy individuals. They're very happy to talk about it in those terms. And - but Republicans aren't thinking in those terms. All they're thinking is - we need to do something.

GARCIA-NAVARRO: But we do have this split in the Democratic Party, as well, between sort of the more liberal wing, the more activist wing and the other part of the party which is, you know, more traditional. So how will that play out?
[Tax and childcare experts say this proposal would favor upper middle class and wealthy Americans who spend more money on childcare than lower income familes. Lower income families are less likely to owe taxes and often do not file itemized taxes, so wouldn't be able to take advantage of a childcare deduction. Trump's campaign responded to criticism that his proposal would favor the wealthy with the following statement about his plan: Mr. Trump's plan would better help struggling families. Current policy does little to help afford costs that can exceed $1000 per month. The deduction will do more than credit for most working and middle class families. We provide credit to stay-at-home caregivers, which no current federal policy provides. To provide benefits to lower-income taxpayers who may not benefit from the deduction, the plan also allows parents to exclude childcare expenses from half of their payroll taxes—increasing their paycheck income each week.  – Trump campaign The campaign says to expect a fully detailed plan in the coming weeks. --Tamara Keith]
Trump has claimed the payment to Daniels had no connection to his 2016 presidential campaign and that it was simply made for personal reasons to do away with untrue allegations. But as Cohen told Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., Wednesday, he was instructed to facilitate the payments to both women because Trump was worried about a wildfire effect after the 2005 footage with Billy Bush surfaced.

DON YOUNG: Well, President Trump's year has been probably more exciting. One thing though I have to stress that I've always said I don't care who the president is, the job of the Congress is to lead this nation. We've lost that over the years since 1935, when we started transferring power to the president and to the executive branch. Most people are controlled by regulatory law, not legislative law. But overall, for Alaska, with Secretary Zinke, we've undone a lot of what the presidents in the past have done. And I think it gives us more freedom and a chance to take it and improve our nation's and our state's economic bases.
The United Nations is predicting that 168 million people, a record, will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 because of extreme weather, large infectious-disease outbreaks and intensifying, protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries. That's around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019, and the number is expected to continue to rise, up to 200 million people by 2022. The U.N. expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to $29 billion.

We did a survey at the Times with Morning Consult, a survey partner we have that I found very amusing: 80% of mothers said they were managing the home school in their house; 45% of fathers said they were managing it. Now, that's impossible. Three percent of mothers said the fathers were managing it. So there's a really big disconnect here. And it's really not surprising because this generation of men does a lot more at home. They do more housework and child care, even in normal times, than their fathers or grandfathers did. But it's still nowhere near equal. And what we found is that men have done more, especially if you're working from home or if your kids' schools are still closed, there's just more to be done. ... Fathers are doing more, but their share hasn't changed. So mothers are also doing more, and they're both still doing the same share they used to. Which means men, in general — of course not all — men are doing less.
Under the old system, wholesalers, retailers and middlemen are the ones required to pay into the APMC system and conduct all their transactions there. The ginger and gooseberry buyer Gohad pays a 1.05% tax on all his transactions. In other states, the payments are made in the form of direct fees. The idea was to keep wholesalers under government supervision and prevent them from undercutting farmers on price.

They landed there early 2017 ready to go. And they don't have a plan. And, of course, you know, have they had done that exercise, they might very well have discovered that, gee, our slogan that we're going to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something that's way better and still true to our conservative principles, well, that wasn't going to happen because at the end of the day, there was no such. But you couldn't - not even in theory, it just wasn't possible. But they never realized that because they hadn't done the homework.
LIASSON: That's right. He is right about where President Obama and President Clinton and George W. Bush were in terms of approval ratings. Now, of course, all three of them went on to lose one house of Congress or both. But where he's different from previous presidents in his approval ratings and what makes him historically unpopular and a potential drag on Republican candidates is the size and intensity of his disapproval ratings. In other words, no one is lukewarm or neutral about President Trump. He's more polarizing than previous presidents. And the difference between his approval rating and his disapproval rating, or his strong approval rating and his strong disapproval rating, is greater than previous presidents. He has a higher disapproval rating. And midterm elections are usually a referendum on the president and his party.
GROSS: And it ends up in a lot of compromise.

Fifty-six percent of adults also say the country is moving in the wrong direction, with just 36 percent saying it is moving in the right direction. With Republicans in control of Congress and the White House, those pessimistic numbers could also prompt voters who want a change to vote for Democrats, perhaps acting as a check on Trump.

You've said that one thing you mean by that is higher wages for people, which is certainly something that has been lacking for a lot of people for decades.

While the legal battle over the question continues, the Census Bureau is facing a time crunch to finalize forms for next year's national head count.

The worst part of this legislation is, is by passing this legislation, it's going to create $36 billion in cuts to seniors and Medicare over 10 years, resulting in hundreds of billions of cuts to Medicare. That's a fact of the bill.

That's unacceptable.
FOWLER: Well, this week many Republican lawmakers who pushed false claims of election fraud have signed on to a number of bills in the Senate aimed at making it harder to vote. And that's after Democrats flipped both U.S. Senate seats and helped defeat President Trump.

Since then, Puerto Rico has held referendums for statehood five times, most recently this year. While Puerto Ricans have rejected statehood in the past, they voted overwhelmingly in favor of it in June.

MARR: Yes. So let's take an example. Picture a single mom with a young little toddler and then a daughter who's a second-grader. And the mom, she works around her children's schedule as a home health aide, helping an elderly person get meals, shower. And she makes about $10,000 a year. So right now, she receives $600 in child tax credit per child. But under this proposal, she would receive 3,600 for the toddler, 3,000 for her second-grader. Each month, that would be about $500. And that's food. That's rent. That's clothes. It really could make a difference in those children's lives.

He's a good example of when the royalty process works. It goes like this: Gas companies and landowners sign a lease agreement before drilling begins.

LIASSON: Well, what we learned from her tax returns is that the Clintons earned $10 million in 2015. Most of it came from Bill Clinton's speaking fees. They paid an effective tax rate - federal and state - of 43 percent. They gave 10 percent of their income to charity, but the implicit message in these tax returns is not so much what's in them, but the Clinton campaign is trying to goad Donald Trump into releasing his tax returns which he has refused so far to do. And there are already ads from Clinton supporters asking what is Donald Trump hiding? Maybe loans to Russian oligarchs, no charitable contributions, maybe he's not a billionaire, maybe he paid zero taxes in 2015. But Donald Trump has said he thinks this is what killed Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney should not have released his tax returns.

SULLIVAN: Well, today was the day the new Parliament elected in November was supposed to convene. And it appears the military just didn't like the idea of that happening, felt it was wrong. And the military and Aung San Suu Kyi have never been close, as Steve said. The military kept her in detention or under house arrest for more than 15 years before it agreed to free her and allow the 2011 general election. But the military-drafted constitution of 2008 allows it to retain a lot of power over the defense ministry, the home ministry. The military also reserved a quarter of the seats in Parliament for itself, and that's prevented Suu Kyi and her party from achieving some of what they wanted and kept the military very involved in how things run. So she's been trying to get the Constitution changed. That hasn't gone down well with the military either.
Well, as I'm sure you know, the caucus and primary map up to this point has really favored the secretary because a lot of her victories, including her big victory in Mississippi yesterday, are in the Deep South.

Woodson has worked closely with Ryan for years, helping him draft an anti-poverty agenda that would streamline spending and give more authority over safety net programs to the states. Ryan has also proposed imposing time limits and work requirements on those getting aid.
This is happening so fast, Bousman says.
Social media may have played a role in creating a kind of scandal-driven, as opposed to issue-driven, campaign, said Todd Grossman, CEO of Talkwalker Americas, where topics such as Trump's attitude towards women, Trump's tax returns and Clinton's emails have tended to dominate discussion as opposed to actual policy issues.
SNELL: Well, we've already heard from the Justice Department that they believe that it isn't legal for Barr to comply with the request. They're saying that he has given them all that they can give them and that if they want more information, they - the Justice Department has offered a closed-door opportunity for Democrats to go and look at the unredacted portions. But, you know, Democrats say that's not enough. They want everything that they see to also be seen by the public.
The White House announced that Blagojevich is among 11 people who received clemency.
It was not immediately clear what information Manafort might provide prosecutors. But he served as Trump's campaign chairman during the critical summer months of 2016, and he attended the now-infamous meeting at Trump Tower that June with a Russian delegation offering dirt on Hillary Clinton.
GREENE: With you as the crybaby?
He can't say, as he did with George Papadopoulos in that guilty plea, this was just a coffee boy. Mike Flynn is no coffee boy. And so putting any distance he can between himself - it's entirely situational. The White House is trying to clean it up because I think they realize the implications of it legally could be problematic. So - but and the way...
The Eastern establishment is a popular variant of the term, one that carries with it not only geographic connotations, but in Halberstam's telling, also the trappings of Ivy League educations and old money.
But the task force recommendations were met with objections from various lawmakers, as well as Gov. Jared Polis. He had asked the task force to consider paid leave models other than a state-run program.
The Clintons frequently point to the foundation's Health Access Initiatives, saying they have lowered the cost of HIV/AIDS treatment around the world, and helped deliver cheaper drugs to more than 9 million people. That's a claim PolitiFact rated as true.
ELVING: That was - that was a bit of a surprise, I think, to quite a number of people that the president was so certain that it would be over. But we shall see, as the president likes to say.
After the deal's Thursday release, she also cast the plan as simply one of any number of environmental proposals the House might consider.
Expensing itself has its detractors of how effective it would be, said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington nonprofit that advocates for smaller deficits. But it's sound theory that expensing should increase investment, which increases economic growth and is good for the economy overall.
SIMON: Yeah. But nobody feels more forgotten than the people of Puerto Rico.

Paglayan's research says you have to go back to the 1960s to understand.
But Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the economy isn't so weak that it needs the Fed to cut rates aggressively.
MANN: Yeah, as you mentioned, Johnson & Johnson's the name brand American company involved here. The other three, Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen and McKesson, work more behind the scenes. But these are some of the biggest health corporations in America. And they all earned huge profits making and distributing highly addictive opioid medications. Now, Scott, they face this wave of lawsuits tied to opioids. And we know from financial filings that the companies are close to a settlement that would resolve all those suits. Here's Cardinal Health CEO Michael Kaufmann speaking to investors last month.

Spicer also suggested that building the border wall would produce savings elsewhere in the federal budget.
MCEVERS: Trump has been on the defensive between, you know, the story about his taxes and this latest story about his foundation. Did he address these at the rally that you were at today?
ELVING: Most of it was pretty predictable - the local pizza parlor, the $6.3 million raised in the first 24 hours. But in that video, there is a narrative being set up where Biden's challenging President Trump more as a kind of civic crusade than an act of political ambition. He talks about the Charlottesville riots in 2017 and the charge that President Trump is unworthy and unfit for the office because of the way he handled those events. That's an attack line, of course, that didn't serve Hillary Clinton too well in 2016.
HORSLEY: Nationwide, the pandemic's toll on state tax collections has been a lot smaller than many people feared last spring. JPMorgan says by the end of 2020, state tax revenues were down only about one-tenth of 1% from what they had been before the pandemic.
Tax Credit Aims To Boost Availability Of Paid Family Leave, But Will It Work?
One is that if more Americans knew how many others do not end up paying federal income taxes, they would say tax rates should stay the same or even be raised.
Given the scope and ambitious nature of the Green New Deal, it might be tempting to criticize or dismiss activists supporting it. But Amy Myers Jaffe hopes older, more experienced policymakers won't do that.
And don't you think it is about time that we put American families first? We are not living in the '50s or '60s anymore. We have got to catch up to how Americans actually live and work in the 21st century.

Connecticut To Insurers: 'We're Making Changes In The Positive Direction'
KEITH: All right. So we are all here tonight to break down the key moments from this, the, third Democratic debate. But first let us do our traditional thing by running through all of the candidates who are on the stage in order of their speaking time. Ayesha.
FAHRENTHOLD: Yes. Trump has a lot of contacts in the world of charity because he rents out ballrooms, hotel ballrooms, the ballroom at Mar-a-Lago to charities. Charities are often the ones that rent out these ballrooms for big events. And so this enables him to support the charities that do business with him, you know, keep in their good graces without actually having to sacrifice any of his own money. So it's a pretty good deal in one way but only if you don't expect that your charitable giving is a way of giving actually something of yourself.
SAGAL: Fans love - love - the jerseys of their favorite players. You know that. One fan expressed his fandom in a very sincere way. What was it? A, one Christopher Lackner of Chicago, Ill., every day has his wife shave the number 34 into his back hair, in honor of the late Walter Payton, B, in 2005, a prisoner successfully lobbied to have his prison sentence raised from 30 to 33 years in honor of number 33 Larry Bird, or C, an Atlantan named BJ Maxwell only dates women who are 31 years old in honor of number 31 on the Braves, Greg Maddux.
KEITH: I have a debate question, which is, in the first debate, Kamala Harris came in with her planned fight that she was going to have with Joe Biden. And Julian Castro clearly came into this debate out to have a fight with Joe Biden. I know that initially, the thought was that Kamala Harris really excelled in that fight with Biden. But in the end, I don't know. Does it actually work? You know, since then, I've talked to a lot of voters who were like, you know, I thought she was really mean to Joe.
The average tax refund is just over $3,000. So to steal that cash, thieves try to get their victims to click on fake IRS websites or give out important information over the phone. That allows the crooks to take on a taxpayer's identity and redirect a refund into their own accounts. Or they intimidate victims into paying taxes owed to the IRS, threatening jail time or lawsuits if the taxpayers don't pony up via prepaid debit cards, money orders or wire transfers.
Trump Faces Critical Phase, As He Tries To Make His Rhetoric Reality
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Jennifer Palmieri, formerly of the Clinton campaign, and Jeff Weaver of the Sanders campaign, thank you both so very much.
Those penalties — $695 or 2.5 percent of your household income, whichever is greater — are also in force for 2018 coverage. But starting next year, you won't owe a penalty no matter how long you may be uninsured. The tax reform law eliminated the penalty for not having health insurance in 2019.
Whatever their motivations (whether they have equal marginal sacrifice on the brain or not), most Americans do favor higher taxes on the rich — 63 percent of Americans believe upper-income Americans pay too little in taxes, according to Gallup.
Biden mourned the more than 520,000 who have died from the virus, noting that more Americans have now died from COVID-19 than in World War I and II, in the Vietnam War and from the attacks on 9/11 combined.

DEMBOSKY: This year, there's a new governor in Sacramento. And advocates are optimistic he'll side with them this time around. For NPR News, I'm April Dombrowski.
NPR's Will Huntsberry sends us this update from the sit-in outside the arena:
MONTAGNE: Well, remind us of everything she did, in fact, say.
The White House has released two excerpts from President Obama's speech. They show that Obama will paint an optimistic picture of the country.
He succeeded the late Robert Morgenthau, who held the DA post for 35 years. Vance said that when he took office in 2010, he didn't aspire to be District Attorney for decades like my predecessors. ... I believed then – and I believe now – that change is a fundamentally good thing for any institution.
President Trump, whose approval rating is lower than any recent president this early in his term, is now staring at an agenda imperiled. Despite his boasts, he has achieved little of significance through Congress. That failure is compounded by the fact that his party controls both chambers.
And when we were coming up, as you heard her talking about her parents, her brothers, we believed in the American dream. It wasn't always going to be easy. My dad was a small-business man; it was hard work. He got off every single day, went off to work and worked hard, and lots of times my mother and my brother and I would be there to help.
On Friday, Biden himself told reporters at the White House: I support passing COVID relief with support from Republicans if we can get it. But the COVID relief has to pass.
ZARROLI: Among those implicated is the prime minister of Iceland, Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson, who allegedly set up an offshore company to hide his family's money. Gunnlaugsson was elected to office after promising to take on the banks.

It will be tough, she suggests, even without the influence of politics.
SHAPIRO: One principle of capitalism is that if you work hard, you'll get ahead. And you can argue whether or not that that's true. But the idea is that it gives people incentive to go to a job every day and earn money, even though it may be an unpleasant experience. This program and the idea of a guaranteed basic income seemed to guarantee that people will get money whether or not they earn it. Does that undermine the incentive for people to have a job and be productive members of society?
And he looked at Mike Pence, and I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so.
So, you are looking at large states like New York state where we think we have a pretty good chance to win. You're looking at the West Coast, where I think we have an excellent chance to win in California, Oregon, Washington State, Hawaii, smaller states like Montana and Idaho.
Noyer was once head of the Banque de France and vice president of the European Central Bank. Right after the U.K.'s 2016 Brexit vote to leave the European Union, the French government under then-President Francois Hollande put Noyer in charge of convincing multinationals that were planning to leave London to relocate their operations to Paris. The competition includes cities like Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg.

That's something Democrats are homing in on. Look: No one likes this bill, said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Hospitals, doctors, governors. Conservatives, liberals, nonpartisan groups. And most of all, the people who would no longer have affordable health care.
ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: I mean, if you really want to understand the narrative, there are three people to be blamed here and I'll speak very generally. Number one, it's Washington, the push for over allocation of capital into that housing area. Number two, it was the greed of Wall Street in terms of the production of these products. And number three, frankly, was Main Street because many people overreached in their homes because there was easy money and easy credit before the financial crisis.
But those savings — even if Republicans could find a way to apply them to a new bill — wouldn't be enough to fund the broad expansion of coverage offered under the ACA.
ORDOÑEZ: Later in the day, Vice President Pence also urged governors to place orders for these so-called N95 masks after some changes in law to the liability laws that make it possible for hospitals to use these industrial masks.
Trump made no mention of his impeachment, the hearings and trial that have riveted Washington for months, even as House impeachment managers sat together in a row before him. Neither did Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who delivered the Democratic response. Trump also made no overt mention of the 2020 election, though Republicans did chant Four more years! as Trump entered the chamber.
Biden then tried to indict Trump by using one of his favorite words: He's trying to tell us he cares about the middle class. Give me a break! That's a bunch of malarkey!
In fact, my first bill in the United States Senate was Access to Counsel Act to ensure that none of the people — and then that was also the Muslim refugees after the Muslim ban — to make sure that nobody would be denied access to counsel when they're going through these hearings around refugee status and around asylum. ...
And the bill defunds Planned Parenthood, meaning it bars Medicaid from paying for health services provided at the clinics. Medicaid is already barred by federal law from paying for abortions, and women's health advocates say the provision is likely to make it harder for low-income women to get birth control, screenings for cervical cancer and mammograms, which Planned Parenthood provides.
Where it stands — in progress
Where The Senate Health Care Defeat Leaves Trump, GOP
In addition to financial assistance for individuals and families, the bill would also direct relief to businesses. That includes $25 billion to the Small Business Administration for a new grant program that targets bars and restaurants and additional funding for a program that assists shuttered venues.
Startups have struggled to build dealership and service networks to sell and repair their vehicles, she said. For established automakers like Ford and GM, those networks already exist, and private mechanics are accustomed to working on those cars.
CORNISH: So even now, even as Sessions has recused himself, you still hear the president, through his tweets, basically saying, this is sour grapes, basically saying, this is a witch hunt. David Brooks, for you, what's the problem with that strategy? Like, how long can you keep saying there's no there there?
He also said he is working on figuring out what young people want in a social network and how to make it better. And, he said, social media users increasingly want to rely on their social networks to make sense of the flood of political opinions, reporting and vitriol they're being bombarded with. One thing that me and my team have tried to do, Hamby told NPR, is explain the election. ... Because a lot of stuff you see on the Web, and TV, is pretty noisy.
Forty-eight counties in Georgia, with thousands and thousands of votes, rejected zero ballots. There wasn't one ballot. In other words, in a year in which more mail-in ballots were sent than ever before, and more people were voting by mail for the first time, the rejection rate was drastically lower than it had ever been before.
At the Democratic debate tonight, one particular aspect of Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All plan got special scrutiny.

If Trump were to impose a tariff on Mexican goods, Gunn says, she has no doubt that would ignite a full-on trade war. Tax for tax.
The American Hospital Association urged Republican leaders to wait until the Congressional Budget Office analyzes the bill.
Ricciardelli has faced some unexpected bills this past year, including a Wi-Fi upgrade so she can work from home and a car to replace her old one, which failed to pass inspection.
And, to me, the crucial - two crucial questions, which are completely unanswered at this point - there's, one, did the Trump people know something about the Russian campaign - the WikiLeaks campaign - during the campaign? Two, do the Russians have something on Trump, whether in the form of some blackmail information, or are they so heavily invested in his companies that he has reason to pay attention to Russia? Those are the two open questions in my mind.
Like the House's bill, the Senate proposal adds nuclear power to the AEPS — requiring utilities to buy power from a newly-created tier 3 list of sources: nuclear, solar, wind, low-impact hydropower and geothermal.
GREENE: So President Trump weighed in on this - tweeting the photo of Franken with his accuser and saying that it speaks a thousand words. This is a really different tone from the president compared to responding to allegations against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore.
AHLUWALIA: I would say each person has a way of understanding and taking a judgment or a call or whatever they want to do it. That's personally. But I feel - when I see it, I see a person who is trying to stick to a campaign promise. And he's also trying to fulfill what he set out to do. Now, if people take it disparagingly or personally, that's up to them. At the same time, if they start focusing on the real objective that he's trying to do is make America safe again. At the same time, getting the people back to job. And again, I keep hearing this narrative, which is to me is - as a businessman, I see the confidence up. I feel the Democratic policies are hurting us at the same time right now with the Schumer shutdown.
The new mayor will also immediately face high levels of violence and crime with the coming of warm weather. While she's still rolling out her top cabinet picks, Lightfoot has made it clear that she will not decide whether to replace Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson until after the summer, in order to provide stability during the traditionally violent season.
The politics of family benefits have come a long way. Among the first government-sponsored welfare programs in the U.S., the mothers' pension gave a stipend to qualifying widows and other single mothers, starting in 1911. One study found the sons of those accepted to the program went on to get more schooling, earn more money and even live longer compared with the sons of women whose applications were rejected.

MONTAGNE: OK, well, the princess is charged with tax fraud, but as you said, she's got 17 codefendants, including her husband. But how are all of them linked?
What's even more problematic for the media is that Tuesday's vote involves a repudiation of the idea that the nation's top leader should care about the facts. On the trail, and throughout his public statements, Trump contradicted the record, the facts, and even himself without the blowback one would expect for a more experienced politician. Indeed, Trump has proved impervious to shame when presented with convincing evidence he is wrong. There's no reason to believe he'll care now. The press will have to consider how it can hold accountable someone who rarely if ever is willing to accept fault. During the general election season this fall, CNN's on-screen captions were often written to be puckish correctives of Candidate Trump's frequent false claims. Will it continue to do so for President Trump?
KEITH: And the senator he is referring to is Senator Elizabeth Warren, who supports a version of Medicare for All or actually just Medicare for All. But when she was asked sort of specifically about, well, what will this mean for middle-class taxes? - she did, you know, a bit of a boxing move and jumped out of the way.
Our opposition, on the other hand, has long ago run out of ideas. All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same: more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and on American production. More of that.

CENSKY: Well, it's been a real split screen. We have Democrats and clerks who are pointing to this election as the safest and most secure of their careers. Barb Byrum is one of the clerks from the larger counties in Michigan, and she called on Republicans this week to say what's been clear throughout all of these hearings - that this election was fair and free of fraud.
Let's use them differently, she says. Let's think about the gas grid as we think about the electric grid and just change what's going through those pipes.
Democratic leadership, however, made clear on Monday night that they are not on the same page as the Trump administration. They don't support a payroll tax cut and say Trump appears to be more concerned about the stock market than dealing with the underlying coronavirus outbreak.
People are experiencing an affordable housing crisis whether they're Republican or Democrat, whether they live in a red community or a blue community, and whether they're middle class or they're working poor, whether they're white or black, says Julian Castro, who was the secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Barack Obama and announced his housing plan this week.

In a letter released Friday, President Trump's lawyers said a decade's worth of his tax returns show that he doesn't owe money to Russian lenders and that he has received no income from Russian sources, with a few exceptions.
KODJAK: I mean, it would clearly have to be through some sort of tax increase. Harris didn't specify what she wanted to do in her town hall, and Sanders, in the proposal that he put on the table, did outline some options. Right now we spend about $3 1/2 trillion a year on health care, and Sanders says his - making Medicare-for-all will cost less. But the proposals to pay for it would be maybe a tax increase on employers to replace what they're now paying for health insurance premiums like a Social Security tax or maybe a tax increase on personal income tax. And then there are always proposals to increase tax rates on the wealthy high-earners and reduce their deductions.

Trump tweeted Tuesday night that he would be making a decision soon about replacing Cohn.
Instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development, Konyndyk says there's a growing mentality in the U.S. that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line. Examples include Trump's freezing and reinstatement of aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies; his threats to cut off countries that don't vote with the U.S. at the United Nations; and his withdrawal of aid to Palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan.
GREG DOTSON: Now, there's a lot of acrimony that you can see in Congress. And where we're sitting right now, it's probably hard to see a big bipartisan bill on climate change, but I don't think that means you stop trying in Congress. And maybe it's tax policy. Maybe it's investment decisions. Maybe it's, you know, budgetary issues.
MCCAIN: At least made decisions whether to remain there, whether to accept an escalation, whether it was in our national security interests to continue the conflict. They basically took a pass and let the executive branch - until after the Tet Offensive, basically the administration had a relatively free hand in conducting the conflict.
Trump Takes On Media For Questioning His Fundraising Efforts For Veterans
Many leading economists, from President Reagan's former White House adviser, Martin Feldstein, to liberal economist Paul Krugman, say that's a mistaken understanding of how the VAT tax works. They say U.S. companies are not disadvantaged.

The state Legislature followed up with a law clarifying that in order to get their voting rights back, felons needed to pay off all fines and fees related to their convictions. Hundreds of millions of dollars in fines are owed across the state, including $278 million in Miami-Dade County alone.
In addition, the framework, as described in the legislation as well as a blog post — containing an updated version of FAQs provided to NPR by Ocasio-Cortez's office — calls for a variety of other lofty goals:
BURKE: Also - also, think back to your mayor days when you showed up at peoples' front door with a present. Like, just do that.
As for the wages part, it's true that many Americans aren't earning as much as they used to. The median household income as of 2015 was $56,516, still below a peak of $57,909 reached in 1999 (in 2015 dollars). To take Trump literally, that median is still above where it was exactly 20 years ago, but it's plausible that some Americans are earning less than they did back then. (That said, last year's median income figure was strong reading, considering that it was up by nearly $3,000 over 2014.)
Meadows added, You gotta have a plan, in order to execute it, and I was not aware of any substantial conversations on the debt ceiling other than 'We gotta raise it.'

Canceling Student Debt Is Easier Than It Sounds
GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with The New Yorker staff writer Evan Osnos about his article President Trump's First Term. Let's talk about what changes Trump might make regarding tax cuts, the Iran nuclear agreement, trade and what the consequences might be if Trump starts a trade war with China after we take a short break. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.
But the challenge is, most of the people who are passing through that system don't have the money either. So what we see is that people get assessed fines and fees, all of these fines and fees, they can't pay them, and that can end up driving them back into jail, which only increases the pressure on the jail system and the justice system overall and makes it more costly. So it's ultimately kind of a vicious circle.
CUTLER: Well, a trade war - no one wins in a trade war, and that's clear. And so in any trade war - let's just say the U.S. increases tariffs against imports from certain countries. U.S. consumers, let's say, would be the first to lose out then because prices would go up. But then if a country counterretaliates, they would then not welcome U.S. exports. And that would affect not only U.S. companies but also workers for those companies that produce the goods.

SCHUMER: It's a good point, Rachel. It doesn't cover enough people for a long enough period of time at a great enough amount of money. And fourth, if they're going to do these corporate bailouts, we want to make sure they're for the workers. The lesson of 2008 is they helped the big boys and they didn't help the average person. So if they're going to get this money - you know, the airline industry and the travel industry and all of these others - we want to make sure they keep all their workers without salary cuts.
Trump is also big on infrastructure as a way to create jobs. He says he would grant the permit needed for the Keystone Pipeline despite opposition from environmental activists, as NPR's Scott Horsley outlined. He also plans to cancel all payments to U.N. climate change programs and put that money toward water and environmental infrastructure, as he wrote in his 100-day action plan. Trump would also lift restrictions on the oil, coal, shale and natural gas industries. In addition, he plans to impose tariffs to discourage companies from relocating to other countries.
We are essential infrastructure to what results in wins for candidates up and down the ballot, again and again and again.

Mexico is one of America's top trading partners, with more than $500 billion worth of goods flowing across the Southern border each year. Spicer argued that adding a 20 percent surcharge to imports from Mexico would quickly cover the cost of the wall.
And I think after talking to people on the Hill and talking to immigration experts and people who are involved in the actual construction of these sorts of large-scale infrastructure, what they say is that the most likely outcome here is that he will make a symbolic extension of what is already a federally financed border fence that has been in place for about a decade. And that that would allow him to satisfy his base and to say that he has gone ahead and built the, quote, unquote, wall. But as a practical matter, it wouldn't really transform the way that the border is policed.
And depending on how they structure their plan, states may have to get approval from the federal government to move ahead.
Cities display one of the most obvious outcomes of income disparity in their distribution of income and neighborhoods. There are, obviously, richer and poorer neighborhoods. This spatial segregation of wealth has probably been part of the urban environment for as long as we've had urban environments. What's new in our networked world of Big Data is a new capacity to see the urban spatial arrangement of human activity as never before.
Last year, Trump sent a team of aides to California on a fact-finding mission on solutions to homelessness in the state.

Beth Soholt, from the Clean Grid Alliance, is skeptical that Coal Creek Station will survive. If Great River River Energy, as good an operator as they are, couldn't make it economically feasible, I find it hard to believe that somebody else would.

They need to capture the opportunity that's in front of them.

If you're an administration that lives by the executive order, than you're going to die by the executive order, too, said Stephen Moore, an economic adviser to Trump.

The record number of judicial nominees confirmed during the Trump administration will be a lasting part of his legacy, with judges confirmed at a prolific pace. In 2019, the Senate changed its debate rules, effectively speeding up the confirmation process for some lower-level judicial and agency nominees.
That means state party officials are fully in his camp, something that has been made perfectly clear since Trump's impeachment. County and state parties in a number of states have moved to censure Republicans who voted to impeach or convict the former president.
About 50 bills are introduced across the country each year to change the process, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, and most don't go anywhere — only one in ten bills affecting primary voting typically end up becoming law.

Transcript: President Obama's Final State Of The Union Address
The returns can reveal how much Trump makes in a given year, but not how much he is worth, something that has been a topic of much debate.
President-elect Donald Trump has promised over and over in recent months that he will repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, when he reaches the White House.
HORSLEY: Well, when it comes to trading goods, we should say, it has no effect. The president's speech was a little bit garbled, and some people were left with the impression that exports from Europe might be affected. The White House clarified in a tweet that the travel ban taking effect at midnight Friday applies only to visitors from Europe, not cargo.
In 2015, Congress convened a committee to study how to cut child poverty in half within a decade. Hoynes served on that committee, as did Tim Smeeding, a professor of public affairs and economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. They say the group issued a clear warning to policymakers: Alleviating child poverty would cost billions, yes, but not doing so would be even more expensive.
MCCAIN: ...It gets tough. It's not beanbag.
Pence has been a strong advocate of free trade, endorsing every trade agreement that's come before him, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership specifically opposed by Trump.

The combination of changing social attitudes and more complex legal issues were major points of discussion when the CCCU assembled representatives of more than 130 of its member institutions in Dallas in late January. College chaplains, student counselors and classroom professors reviewed how they were responding to LGBT students, while administrators and financial officers considered whether they need to prepare for more government scrutiny of their positions and policies on sexual orientation and activity.
LIASSON: On Thursday, the president announced some very tough tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum that stunned many in his own White House because this hadn't gone through any kind of a policy process. He does seem eager to start a trade war. He tweeted, trade wars are good and easy to win. That's a view shared by just about zero economists. This move is only favored by a very small group in the administration - the commerce secretary, the U.S. trade representative but not the treasury secretary, the secretary of defense or the president's top economic adviser.
We will ban ballot harvesting and prohibit the use of unsecured drop boxes to commit rampant fraud. These drop boxes are fraudulent. Therefore, they get disapp — they disappear, and then all of a sudden they show up. It's fraudulent.
By one measure, the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century. The most current estimate by the World Economic Forum — which publishes an annual report to track country-by-country progress across economic, educational, health and political dimensions — is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99.5 years at the current rate.
Earmarks and pork-barrel spending are as American as a bridge to nowhere. They're little, and sometimes not so little, holiday packages designed to win the votes of senators and representatives for national legislation with government money that's earmarked to directly benefit their states or districts. Many Democrats have groused about the latest examples that have been added, often in hand-written scrawls, into the new tax bill. Norman Ornstein is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and joins us now. Norm, thanks for being with us.
But what's important is that those economists were speaking in the aggregate — they were talking about Americans altogether getting their goods more cheaply and having a better standard of living, for example. Particular Americans are still worse off because of trade deals.
Remember, special elections are still special
In addition to having to pay bail, they are assessed a cost for their housing, so it's as if they're in a hotel. ... There's a daily rate that they are responsible for. They will have to pay the cost of any lab tests associated with their case. They will have to pay the cost of drug testing.
I see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to; the new citizen who casts his for the first time; the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count, because each of them in different ways know how much that precious right is worth.
SIMON: A lot of that sounds potentially quite unpopular.
So, yes, there are parallels there that we should worry about. But as you indicated, Robert, a key difference is our policymakers did act much more aggressively, much more quickly.
We've protected an open internet, and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online. We've launched next-generation manufacturing hubs, and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day.
Given four choices of how many Americans pay zero or negative federal income taxes (11, 27, 45, or 63 percent), fully 70 percent of poll respondents chose the options under the correct answer, which was 45 percent. Some of these people simply have no taxable income, and others get money back as a result of refundable tax credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Of course, these people might pay other taxes, like payroll taxes, as well as whatever sales and property taxes their states impose.)
Trump's Suggested Import Tax Would Mean Americans Pay For That Wall
Stocks fell deeper into the red this morning as investors tried to grapple with the economic cost of the coronavirus pandemic. Trading was briefly halted just minutes after the opening bell, when the S&P 500 index plunged by seven percent. Last night, President Trump announced new measures to try to contain the virus and shore up the economy.
But as U.S. production reaches record levels — it recently surpassed the previous high point in 1970 — a complex web of laws and court rulings is evolving over how these royalties are distributed. That's creating vast differences in how much money property owners actually get and prompting a number of lawsuits accusing energy companies of shortchanging them.

To understand why, we need to go back to Aug. 14, 1935. That is when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the original Social Security Act.

SNELL: Well, you know, the thing that - this has kind of come down to a technical conversation about timing. Republicans in the Senate, there are a number of them who say that they are also onboard with Democrats who want to bring in witnesses, but they don't want to do it when Democrats want to do it. They don't want to have a witness conversation before this trial gets started.
Here in the U.S., this is a big reason we've never gotten to fully universal coverage. Inevitably, it's going to - you know, to do it properly, to get everybody insurance, to make sure it's good insurance, to finance the system, get costs under control - one way or another, you know, you're going to be taking money away from the drug industry and from the hospital industry. You're going to be changing some people's insurance arrangements. And every one of those changes is a fight. It's a struggle. And it's just really hard to do.

Mallorca and its sister islands in the Balearics had long been governed by Spain's conservatives — 11 of whom, former government officials, are defendants in this trial. Their alleged crimes came out at the height of the economic crisis here, when ordinary Spaniards were suffering. And last spring, the island's conservatives lost their majority in local elections.
They would have taken different positions; they would have done different things with their lives, Shavitz said. They would not have moved to take on this job; they would not have left jobs that they had for years to take on this position.
A White House spokesman criticized the release in a statement:
Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto canceled a planned trip to the U.S. amid Trump's continued assertion that his country would repay the U.S. for the border wall. One possibility to recoup the investment from Mexico that the White House floated was a 20 percent import tax, which, as NPR's Scott Horsley reported, would effectively saddle U.S. consumers with a significant portion of the wall's cost, estimated at $15 billion or more.
He could change the details of how the marketplaces work, Hoadley says. It's all worked out through regulation. You could just suspend the regulations.
We want to make sure they don't use this money for stock buybacks. The airline industry, for instance, last year did - when they got that big tax cut, did $39 billion of stock buybacks. That's money they could have had to deal with the problems now. So we don't want that. We don't want the money to go to CEO salaries or to the shareholders. Those are the ones who should be more on the lines than the workers, who have done nothing wrong. Our package is extensive and aimed at the problem.
On the picket lines, teachers at times won better pay packages and more respect. But in 19 states including New Jersey and New York, in exchange for collective bargaining agreements, they also accepted severe penalties for striking — like losing two days of pay for every day they were out, or even having their union dissolved.
I think Barack Obama took a big first step. I really appreciated what Barack Obama did - and then criticized aspects of Sanders' plan. So clearly, I think, many candidates are saying Joe Biden might have a point here that voters are latching on to. And I need to moderate my health care position just a little bit.
Other methods for paying tax bills, including paying through tax-prep software, remained available throughout the day. The IRS also encouraged anyone seeking to file an extension to use a software provider.
There was shock this week at the suggestion of a 70 percent tax rate. But law professor Dorothy Brown explains to NPR's Scott Simon that the U.S.'s marginal tax rate has been as high as 94 percent.
SIEGEL: Do you agree with that or, having gone through a cycle like this, is there something flawed in the way we're funding campaigns?
You deflate the value of the asset and then you put in a request to the tax department for a deduction, Cohen explained.
[His numbers are generally right here: the labor force participation rate — the share of people working or looking for work — right now is at 62.8 percent. That rate hit a recent low of 62.4 percent in September 2015, but it has been hanging in the 62 to 63 percent range for around two years now. The last time it was in that range was the late 1970s. However, this statistic is very easy to misunderstand. As we explained above, though some of the recent decline was due to weakness in the economy, some of this decline has been due to demographics (i.e., Baby Boomers retiring), so the decline in the rate isn't entirely a bad thing. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

Incarcerated people are amongst the least-able to jump over all the hurdles and overcome all the barriers that have been placed in the way of trying to get these payments, he said.

COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have continued to surge nationwide, crossing worrying new milestones at an increasingly fast pace. When the U.S. surpassed 12 million confirmed cases in mid-November, it had recorded one million new cases every six days for three weeks. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists estimate that the total number of infections may be eight times higher than reported.) By the start of December, the country had broken its previous records for the number of people hospitalized with the virus as well as its single-day death toll.

This will go over like a Vespa at Sturgis. The problem isn't that Harley is unpatriotic — it's that tariffs are stupid. They're tax increases on Americans, they don't work, and apparently we're going to see more of this, he said.
Other Republicans joined in Trump's criticism, including Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, who is Romney's niece. For an incoming Republican freshman senator to attack Trump, she tweeted, is disappointing and unproductive.
China could retaliate in other ways, however. Beijing's cooperation has been critical to the U.S. effort to impose economic sanctions on North Korea.
Later in the program, the Barbershop guys give their take on the week's news.
BIDEN: We, Americans, choose unity over division.
In exchange for helping to teach courses or working with professors on research projects, MIT gives students such as Oostrom a modest $30,000 stipend. And as part of the deal she also doesn't pay tuition. The arrangement is typical for many students at MIT and other universities.
3. The package is likely to pass Congress entirely with Democratic votes
Trump also argues for a change in financing Medicaid, the joint federal and state health insurance program for the poor and disabled. His plan calls for block grants, or lump-sum payments, to the states that they could spend as they wish. The idea has been popular with Republicans going back to President Reagan, has been revived more recently by GOP governors as a way to cut costs and has been part of Republican proposals to repeal and replace Obamacare. Critics say block grants would reduce the number of people covered by Medicaid and by shifting responsibilities to the states would ultimately saddle them with greater financial burdens.
Brownell and other gun rights advocates say that they've had to be on defense for the past eight years under the Obama administration.
Friday's gross domestic product report is a key indicator ahead of the Federal Reserve's expected interest rate cut next week.
Kelsey, as we often say, it's Congress that controls the purse strings. How receptive are they sounding to this pitch by the administration?
4. Is there anything in this plan for Democrats?
KENNEDY: That's a great question right now. What a lot of restaurants are doing is trying to retool, trying to allow for more takeout, drive-through, delivery services. For a lot of restaurants, they just physically aren't able to configure themselves that way. For other restaurants, they're looking at whether or not switching to that business model is going to generate enough revenue to keep the doors open and the burners turned on.
MARTIN: Right. So, Asma, I guess off of that, I mean, did the debate get Democrats any closer to establishing who is the best to beat President Trump? We just heard Mara say there that Bernie Sanders is feeling pretty comfortable, and the others don't want to concede because - they don't want to coalesce around anyone else because that would be conceding defeat.
There was a big question about the [2017] Tax Cut and Jobs Act, whether or not it would over time have much of a stimulative effect, said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the non-partisan Tax Policy Center. This one, there's no question. Everyone agrees it will stimulate the economy. The question is will it stimulate the economy too much?
Congressional Democrats are united in their opposition to the tax bill. They argue that it's overly tilted to the rich, with the bulk of the savings going to the top 1 percent of the income ladder by 2027.
Sure, he and the GOP Congress would like to get to a tax overhaul, but that lingers only as a distant dot on the horizon.
Brian Jones, a former senior aide to the Chris Christie presidential campaign, said, Danny is a gifted political strategist and manager, pretty much without peer in the Republican Party. Gov. Bush was lucky to have Danny at the helm of his campaign, just like the last three GOP presidential nominees were fortunate enough to have him working on their presidential bids.
Philadelphia's tax on sugary drinks has the potential to change lives for the better – preventing chronic disease and extending quality of life by simply incentivizing families to choose health, the brief concludes.
Columbine, Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, Marjory Stoneman Douglas: Sadly, mass murders at American schools have been so common that it's all too easy for people to instantly name several that have happened in the last few decades alone.
He knows what it is like to lose a steel mill job. This is the third mill he has worked at in recent years. One of the previous mills went bankrupt; the other moved most of its jobs to Mexico. Along the way, Almashy lost his home, his pension and his 401(k).

But on whether he bears any blame, Trump said, We're not going to own it; I'm not going to own it.
STONE: They were looking at premiums costing the rest of them $400 to $600 a month and deductibles of more than $6,000 per person. And they just decided, you know, it's not worth it.
COHN: So one of the big, you know, the big ideas for how Democrats were going to pass health care reform was they were going to negotiate with all of the industries. And they were going to go to every industry and basically say, look, you work with us. We'll work out some kind of deal where you'll give up something. We'll pay you a little less here or there. And in exchange, we will not - you know, we will not go to - we will not be as aggressive as we could be with you. And in exchange for that, you won't fight us on the bill. And this was all - came out of the failures in the past. And the saying was sort of, you know, on the bus or in front of the bus or, you know, on the menu or at the table.
The new plan is to extend the current $300 weekly federal unemployment payments through Sept. 6, rather than the end of September as Senate Democrats had planned. The first $10,200 in unemployment benefits received in 2020 by households earning $150,000 or less would also be nontaxable.
BOOKER: OK, this is pressure. Go ahead.
Update at 9:02 p.m. ET. Panetta Interrupted:
Remember: all of the people telling you you can't have the country you want, are the same people telling you that wouldn't stand, I mean they said Trump doesn't have a chance of being here tonight. Not a chance. The same people. Oh we love defeating those people. Don't we? Don't we? Love it. Love it. Love it.
You can read the bill yourself here.
Even though the situation has improved, there are still revenue shortfalls and major new costs, said Michael Leachman of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
SYMMES: I say they're wrong. And I have confidence that the truth and integrity and character will win.
That's too high, Hutchinson said of the $350 billion request for state and local governments. Needs to be lower. Needs to be compromise reached so we can bring bipartisan support.
His broader proposal includes a tax-rebate check of $1,000 for every adult tax filer making less than $100,000 per year and $500 for each dependent. Married couples making less than $200,000 per year would be eligible for a $2,000 rebate.
Those were priorities during the campaign, but they weren't attached to a tax plan. It's an attempt to paint Trump as bipartisan in trying to get Democrats on board since those are measures they'd likely have some measure of support for — although the details are always what matter.
The Trumps have cast aside other traditional signs of the peaceful transfer of power. When Biden's daughter Ashley was asked Tuesday on NBC's Today by Jenna Bush Hager, the daughter of a former Republican president, whether soon-to-be first lady Jill Biden had heard from Melania Trump, she said, No, I don't think they're doing the traditional protocol, which is unfortunate, but I think we're all OK with it.
[There are no federal legal requirements for paid family leave in the U.S., and among OECD countries, the United States is the only country that doesn't offer paid maternity leave. Some states have their own paid leave laws and most U.S. workers are covered by the Family Medical Leave Act, which allows for up to 12 weeks of leave annually, albeit unpaid. - Meg Anderson]
RAZ: In a hundred years, if people are talking about you, what do you want them to say about you?
Ethically, Rieder says poor nations get some slack because they're still developing, and because their per capita emissions are a sliver of the developed world's. Plus, it just doesn't look good for rich, Western nations to tell people in poor ones not to have kids. He suggests things like paying poor women to refill their birth control and — something that's had proven success — widespread media campaigns.
You are going to need additional adults in the system, said Blomstedt, the president of the Council of Chief State School Officers, who has been talking with other school leaders around the country.
On the 2020 campaign trail, presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren talk about how their plans would replace the current, private insurance system with a single, government-run program. Their proposed systems would eliminate most cost sharing, so patients pay very little out-of-pocket, and would be financed through taxes. Warren, a Massachusetts senator, says she would implement her plan through two legislative steps, while Vermont's Sanders would do so in one.
Noyer credits the election of Macron with much of the change. The French president is quickly following through on his promise to transform the country. He's overhauled notoriously rigid French labor laws, making it easier to hire and fire. And his government is preparing a raft of pro-business measures. Noyer says today France has the highest labor flexibility in continental Europe, and Paris is now an obvious destination.
Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our very dangerous southern border and My administration has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on the southern border. It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry.
Ossoff and Democrats hope to Make Trump Furious
And by the way, there is one case published in the media that a al-Qaida individual was captured and gave information about weapons of mass destruction, which found itself into speeches given by the administration, and I think the president. It turned out later on, the guy recanted. You see? So it's not that useful. And psychological methodology is far more effective. The Israelis have been prohibited from using torture by their Supreme Court. They use psychological methods.
2. Am I going to get a large tax break from this?
KAMALA HARRIS: Well, listen; the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care. And you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require.
HARRIS: Yeah. There has been quite a lot of buzz, and quite a few studies are underway involving some potential treatments. One is Chloroquine, which is an old malaria drug that's been used for decades, actually. That's being studied in China, South Korea and France, among other places. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said his agency is giving a quick thumbs-up to a clinical trial of that in the United States. Since it's already approved, doctors have already been free to prescribe it if they want. But so far, there's a lot of hype and hope, but not much evidence behind it.
Most of the problem is that teachers just steal them, Mukuria says. With schools that don't have proper storage, it's tough. Things just go missing. When pads are kept in a secure place, that can lead to different concerns. Girls may then have to go each month to an intermediary, perhaps reluctantly. It's not uncommon to have a man in charge, she adds. At best, that's humiliating.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And that's exactly the point they tried to make to their son, Nick (ph). But he told me that when he was growing up, he saw real enthusiasm for the profession.
Because of France Telecom's change in status from a public company to a private firm subject to free-market forces, the management had the heavy task of explaining this new world to its employees, Mesnooh says. And the irony is that the company has communicated much better with the market and its competitors than with its own employees.
Sixty-five percent of all people said the estate tax should be abolished, compared to 76 percent who said the death tax should be. However, among Democrats that swing was far larger: only half said they wanted to abolish the estate tax, but 71 percent said the same of the death tax.
A lack of confidence in Congress is more consistent across party lines. Seventy-eight percent of Americans say they don't have very much or any confidence at all in the legislative branch. Those who share that view include 81 percent of Democrats, 82 percent of independents and even 76 percent of Republicans (whose party controls both the House and the Senate).
And all of this is to say nothing of the pressures Biden is facing from the progressive left, which wanted nothing more than to beat Trump. Now that they have, progressives are eager to make sweeping change. But the numbers in Congress aren't there.
The trend is spreading to not just the coasts, but more and more states. Colorado had a bill introduced this session, says Alex Rossello, policy analyst for the National Apartment Association, which represents landlords. I would predict that Washington will be the next place where we'll see this type of policy introduced.
LEACHMAN: After the last recession, we made a big mistake. Federal government provided some aid to states and localities, but it was far too little, and it ended much too soon.
DETROW: Well, I think it's worth noting that he has a really busy week. He has this Western swing, then he's up and down the East Coast and the Midwest later this week. According to some reports, Trump did do debate prep yesterday. But right now we don't see him carving out several days to do preparation like Hillary Clinton had been doing before the first debate.
HORSLEY: Good to be with you, Scott.
In America, we don't begrudge people being successful — that's part of the American dream — but not if they get rich by destroying other people in the process.
Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, is a big supporter of this approach. In an interview with NPR, Brady said that right now, American companies and workers are competing with one hand tied behind their backs, because our tax code is so outdated.
Whether such a requirement would be constitutional under the Commerce clause is perhaps the most challenging question posed by such a proposal, they wrote, as it is a novel issue whether Congress may use this clause to require an individual to purchase a good or a service.

Harris: Yes, I think that there should be.
RAZ: Charlie Kline started to type the historic message, an online communication roughly equivalent to what the Neanderthal is to modern man. This is how Len Kleinrock, the man who headed UCLA's computer lab, recalls the event.
And now let's ask about President-elect Trump's tax plan. He campaigned on a promise of big tax cuts. And his advisers on tax policy include Arthur Laffer. That's a familiar name to people who've followed politics for a long time because Laffer's work once influenced President Ronald Reagan's tax cuts, big tax cuts in the '80s, which reshaped the economy and also increased deficits. We reached Arthur Laffer at his home in Nashville, Tenn.
BROOKS: But whether they're going to actually get these tax credit plan, which I think substantively is a good plan - I just think a guy who is offering a lot of security and order is not going to pass a health care bill that would increase a lot of risk for a lot of people.
MARR: There is a mix. And actually, there's quite a bit of momentum on the Republican side. Prominent Republicans in the Senate have actually identified the child tax credit as an area of possible cooperation with President Biden. Senator Romney was the first Republican to advance a proposal to make a large share of the child tax credit fully refundable, exactly in line with the proposal that President Biden has advanced. Right? And there is very much an entry point here for conservatives from a family perspective. They see this as strengthening families, helping children, investing in children as well.
The Trump administration invested heavily in developing a vaccine, but has left distribution largely up to states. The number of shots delivered so far has fallen far short of what was promised.
ELIZABETH WARREN: The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they've been in are the women, Amy and me.

KING: Rachel, we actually were able to get in touch with you because of a note that you put up on social media describing what your family was going through. And I want to put this question to both of you. Rachel, we'll start with you. You are making these big sacrifices. And I want to ask you what you might tell the people who are listening, many of whom are wondering - what should I be doing right now?
Garland, a moderate judge with deep prosecutorial experience, will soon lead a Justice Department reeling from political scandals and racing to confront the threat from violent homegrown extremists.
[In a footnote to the speech, Trump pointed to a December 2015 CBO working paper, which estimated that in 2025, the labor force would be smaller by 2 million full-time-equivalent workers than it would be without Obamacare — meaning people would work fewer hours, enough to equal 2 million FTE workers. However, that's not necessarily bad for those people: a combination of factors would reduce the amount of work done in the U.S. economy: Some people would choose to work fewer hours; others would leave the labor force entirely or remain unemployed for longer than they otherwise would, the CBO reported. In other words, some people might work less because health insurance is no longer a big incentive to working. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

McConnell had already delayed the bill's vote after Arizona Sen. John McCain was hospitalized because of a serious surgery to remove a blood clot in his head. Now, with the loss of support from two more senators — conservatives Mike Lee of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas on Monday night — the bill is effectively dead.
KHALID: And in Ohio, Clinton ripped into her opponent, questioning his business acumen.
GINGRICH: No. Look. I don't think it's ever smart to be happy, or proud, to use that word, about causing pain to people. But I think what he was trying to say was that if the cost of getting to control of the Southern border is a head-on collision, that he is willing to have that head-on collision.
Big business has a vested interest in that argument. A tax on health benefits would be a pay cut for its workers. Corporate payroll taxes would also rise if the value of worker health benefits counted toward required employer contributions to Social Security and Medicare.
He also argues that a faster growing economy will not only provide jobs for the unemployed but will attract others back into the labor force, including some retirees. Most economists are skeptical that could provide enough workers to get to a 4 percent growth rate.
And they would bar people from using tax credits to buy policies that pay for abortion and also block Planned Parenthood from getting any money from Medicaid for a year.
GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded about what's become an increasingly common pattern in which towns and cities pass laws - ranging from laws banning discrimination against LGBTQ people to increasing the minimum wage, mandating paid sick leave and banning fracking - only to have their state legislature pass a law that overrules the local ordinance. This has become known as preemption. Our guest, Lisa Graves, has been tracking the trend for PR Watch, the online news journal of The Center of Media and Democracy. She's the center's director.
Minimum wage: Progressives are pushing for an increase to the minimum wage, boosting it to $15 an hour by 2025.
AMY KLOBUCHAR: ...I favor is something that - what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning.
Restaurants generally measure their cash flow and available credit in days, weeks - probably not months. So as this becomes a sustained problem, restaurants are going to have some really tough decisions to make, which is why we need Congress to act quickly.
SIMON: When the president says he's getting praise in Puerto Rico for what his administration's doing and we see and we speak with people without food, water, power or medicine, does he look either incompetent or just profoundly out of touch?
Republicans have for a long time used the phrase cancel culture to criticize the left. But lately, they have seized on it particularly aggressively.

If percent is taken as rate here, the answer is false. In 1980, the top marginal income tax rate was 70 percent. Today, it's 39.6 percent (something about half of Americans know, per our poll).
We the People. Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we've come to recognize mean all the people, not just some; words that insist we rise and fall together. That brings me to the fourth, and maybe the most important thing I want to say tonight.
Chinese scientists rapidly posted the genetic sequence of the virus, which enabled the CDC and other health authorities to make a test for it. And biologists who've been studying the mutations in this new virus say it couldn't have been around for much longer than that. So the Chinese actually were pretty prompt in alerting the world about this.
GREENE: So you said you're sitting on a bench, looking over at the cathedral, other people along with you taking all this in this morning. I mean, what are people saying in terms of the meaning of what happened yesterday?
MONTAGNE: Roger Simon, you're a screenwriter as well as a conservative. Why are you personally interested in Donald Trump?
And it's hard to believe that that's really what's holding people back from getting them, that they can collect a modest unemployment check.
Hilary Hoynes says this expansion would continue the status quo, leaving behind families with the lowest incomes.
Nearly all of the emphasis was basically on getting poor, single mothers back into the workplace.
I've met all kinds of workers, painters, plumbers. I've met small businesses that provided pianos, installed glass or marble, all of whom were denied payment and after going back time and again being told, well maybe we'll pay thirty cents on the dollar or fifty cents on the dollar. That's not how we do business in America.
Trump approved construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, which had both been stopped during the Obama administration amid outcry from environmental groups. Other executive orders directed the Commerce Department to review how federal regulations might be impeding U.S. manufacturers.
Furman's original plan was criticized on numerous grounds. Some didn't like the idea of sending everyone checks, and lawmakers are now discussing putting an income limit on who gets them. Furman explains that he originally pitched his idea as a universal program to limit bureaucratic inefficiencies and get checks out the door faster. But now he thinks that putting an income limit on who gets checks wouldn't slow down the process much, and he says, That would be completely fine to do.

After one year in office, supporters of President Trump review his accomplishments and what they say he can do better.
This poll continues to show a decline in confidence in all major democratic institutions, from the presidency to the media. Seven in 10 Americans say they don't trust the media at all or have any confidence in them, while 28 percent have either a great deal of confidence in the press or quite a lot. About half of Democrats (52 percent) say they trust the press and have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in it, but 91 percent of Republicans and 74 percent of independents say they have not very much or no confidence at all in the media.

DETROW: He was specifically talking tonight about something that he told the NPR POLITICS PODCAST. He had said he had voted for - to authorize the war in order to give President Bush leverage but that he had begun to oppose the war the moment that bombs started dropping, the moment that it began. Well, that just wasn't true. Biden didn't really fully oppose the war until about two years later, and he addressed that discrepancy tonight.
Tech Giants Join Corporate Reckoning Over Political Spending
MCEVERS: And, Sue, the president says he wants to move on to other things like tax reform. That's obviously something that has to go through Congress. Is that the plan? And how likely is it that there will be cohesion in the Republican Party on that?
COHN: Yeah. So there's no one silver bullet. I mean, really, what they've done is they've sort of come up with a list of all the little things you need to do to improve vaccine distribution. And they are basically working on all of them. So - you know, they run the gamut. I mean, we're seeing them set up these mass vaccination clinics, for example, big parking lots and stadiums. We're also seeing them pay attention to supplies for the vaccine makers, making sure that the vaccine - you know, vaccine production is very difficult. It requires certain kind of machines. It requires certain raw materials. And so they're using what's known as the Defense Production Act to make sure that the supply orders have priority. They're trying to do a much better job of communicating with the state, saying, look, this - you can count on getting X vaccines for the next three weeks.
They also want to indoctrinate your children in school by teaching them things that aren't so. They want to indoctrinate your children. It's all part of the comprehensive assault on our democracy, and the American people are finally standing up and saying no. This crowd is, again, a testament to it.
SELYUKH: Pickering is a dog walker and pet sitter. It's not a job you may associate with tourism, but 70% of her business relies on people traveling. She says this is normally her busiest time looking after dogs and cats and guinea pigs as people head out for spring break or to shake off the winter blues. Instead, she's down to two clients who are paying even though they don't really need a dog walker.
There's going to be a whole lot of things coming down the pike, said Shakir, pointing to voting rights legislation, measures aimed at strengthening organized labor and campaign finance reform, among other Democratic priorities. And you can imagine that those are areas where Republicans are not going to offer the 10 votes to get you past the 60-vote threshold.

We have nothing to do with it. These groups are for, they're forming all over the United States. And we got to remember, in a year from now, you're going to start working on Congress and we got to get rid of the weak Congress, people, the ones that aren't any good, the Liz Cheneys of the world. We got to get rid of them. We got to get rid.

Cordeiro acknowledged she would welcome the chance to work a little less and spend more time with her daughter.
Did Social Media Ruin Election 2016?
Look; Jack Kennedy at his inauguration said, America will go anywhere and bear any burden in defense of freedom. And there was the belief in both Kennedy and Johnson and Nixon administration that if Vietnam fell - the domino theory - all of Asia would fall, et cetera, et cetera. Well, clearly that was not the case. And in fact, Nixon's trip to China during the Vietnam War was an interesting scenario.
State Sen. John Yudichak (I-Luzerne) said he's heard from the leaders of two businesses who say they are interested in investing in Pennsylvania if the tax credit goes through. He disputed the criticism that the bill represents a corporate handout, and said the companies are only eligible for the tax break once the plants are up and running.
JACKLEY: I don't believe they will because what this decision really does - it just evens the playing field. So when you really look at what the South Dakota legislature did, they put in place safe harbors. They put in place making sure it didn't apply back in time. And we're part of a streamlined sales tax agreement that I think avoids a lot of the concerns that maybe existed in some of the previous United States Supreme Court decisions.
In negotiations between the House and Senate, lawmakers agreed to a slightly higher corporate tax rate than Republicans initially wanted: 21 percent instead of 20 percent. They also lowered the top individual tax rate to 37 percent.
There are as many plans for the $1,400 stimulus checks as there are people who will receive them. For Cailin Rawlins, the money can't come soon enough. She and her fiancé had made plans to move into a new place in late March — and then calamity struck.
INSKEEP: When you're talking about moderates, help me understand what you're talking about here, Domenico. You're saying that - I don't know - Texas Democrats, who gained some ground in the last election, might be a little worried about signing on to the idea of phasing out fossil fuels. That sort of thing?
Biden closed his speech by conjuring American exceptionalism.
Weinstein notes that there are some areas where Republicans and Democrats might find common ground, including expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income workers and providing more education and job training to help people get out of poverty.
Trump campaigned on a promise to crack down on immigration. The clearest example of that was his promise to build a big, beautiful wall along the U.S.-Mexico border — a core issue for his base.

I've gone from running two or three programs to five, six, seven programs. We're two years behind. I can't keep up. In a situation where I'm just not happy anymore, Rucker says.
The vice president also highlighted how Black Americans had contributed to battling the public health crisis. She mentioned the health care and essential workers who have been on the front lines during the pandemic — such as Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett, who contributed to the development of the Moderna vaccine, and Sandra Lindsay, the first nurse to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in the U.S..
When it comes to foreign policy, Trump's main focus has been to upend U.S. trade policy. He has promised to renegotiate or withdraw from NAFTA, the United States' free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. According to NPR's Marilyn Geewax, actually doing away with NAFTA might not actually be feasible, but Trump could undermine it. He also wants to label China a currency manipulator and, per his 100-day plan, identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately.
Those cuts to legal immigration in exchange for a DACA deal have been a nonstarter for many Democrats. At the same time, many in the president's conservative base are upset that he would offer any path to citizenship for DACA recipients and the broader group of immigrants known as DREAMers.

It has been a chaotic week in Washington, even by the Trump White House standards. The president lost his top aide, Hope Hicks. His son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is under scrutiny for his business dealings again. And the president pingponged around on gun control policy, confusing Congress. But the biggest Trump shock came at the end of the week. He may have started a trade war. NPR's political correspondent Mara Liasson is here to help us sort it all out. Good morning, Mara.

If I'm trying to suppress the vote, and if I am Jim Crow Jamie, why did I create the waivers that Democrats have been turning around and using? Which one is it? Grant said. If what the effect of what I passed flips the state blue — so be it, I'm good with that. I did my job.
Some of the economists arguing for $10,000 forgiveness warn that anything higher runs the risk of rewarding borrowers who don't need the help.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., presided over the chamber, but when the president approached the dais before he began his speech, he apparently declined to shake her hand.
And let's provide debt relief — let's provide debt relief as soon as we can, as soon as we start to work, Elizabeth. We'll take the day off for the inauguration, and then the Senate, the Congress, the White House, we're going to get to work to give students and their families relief from this debt.
The hearing before Judge Hazel is set for June 18 — a day after the Supreme Court is expected to release its next batch of decisions, which may include a ruling for similar citizenship question lawsuits based in New York. Earlier this week, plaintiffs in the New York cases asked the justices to delay issuing a ruling until a lower court in Manhattan can finish reviewing evidence from Hofeller's documents of an alleged cover-up within the administration of the question's origins.
Everyone has said things they wish they didn't say. Everyone has done things they wish they didn't do, Jordan said. So who's next? Who will the cancel culture attack next?
The challenge here is: How do they plan ahead? said White House press secretary Jen Psaki.
The mostly British audience erupts into laughter.
Trump has also promised to undo all of President Obama's executive actions, which include two on immigration (only one of which is in effect). Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals allows certain people brought to the country illegally as children to apply for protection against deportation for two-year periods. That protection would go away, it seems.

In this new digital era, with Facebook and Google taking the lion's share of all digital advertising, media outlets have been going under across North America. The COVID-19 crisis has made the situation even worse, Honderich wrote.
We are 86 days from the election, and things continue to get heated in the race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Here to talk about this past week in politics is NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson. She joins us from Martha's Vineyard, which is also where President Obama is on vacation. Welcome, Mara.
President Trump has suggested he doesn't want the Internal Revenue Service to enforce Obamacare's requirement that every person have insurance. Today, individuals who can't prove they have coverage must pay a fine of $695 or more. Oliver Wyman's analysis shows that if the mandate isn't enforced, many young healthy people would drop their coverage.
SIMON: What do you think the shake-up in leadership at the depart - by the Department of Homeland Security indicates? I mean, there are more acting - there's more acting - people with the title acting in it than at the, you know, actors studio in New York.

Joanna Hogg's movie, which centers on a young film student, is the first of a projected two-part drama drawing from Hogg's life. It won the top prize in Sundance's world cinema dramatic competition.
So this is personal for me. And it's personal for a lot of people.
It was interesting, we just did some work in Oklahoma City, and we looked at just a week's worth of booking into the jail from the Oklahoma City Police Department, and fully a third of the people who were booked into jail were booked on traffic violations, and not DUI — everything but DUI, we took DUI out of the mix. We're talking about just violations — broken taillight, driving on a suspended license, failure to make a turn signal — most people got three or four of them, some of them had, again, warrants for not having paid other fines and fees, and that's sweeping them in.
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid delivered perhaps the most stinging rebuke of Republicans and their presidential nominee, Donald Trump, that we've seen at the DNC. He said this about the Republican majority leader:
Americans also think Trump has hurt the country on the global stage. Fifty-eight percent say the president has weakened the United States' position abroad, while 34 percent say he has strengthened it.
Democrat Chrissy Houlahan On Pennsylvania's 6th
HASSETT: Yeah, for sure. And again, think about it - that over the last two years, things have come in pretty close to what we've said. And I think that you were sort of jumping the gun a little bit to say that these tax cuts - and really, the whole plan because there's more than just taxes affecting growth - can't lift revenues over time. Usually the models that give you long-run feedback, you know, take five, 10 years for the growth of GDP to rise to the level where the revenues are back where they started. But the fact is...
In India alone, 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020, according to a government report. And an August report from the World Resources Institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one-quarter of the global population — including Botswana, India, Iran and Mexico — are using as much or more water than they can replace.
MARTIN: Puneet, what do you think?
Assistant Solicitor General Eric Feigin, representing the Trump administration, took incoming fire from an ideologically diverse set of justices.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: When you say mistakes, what are you talking about?
But it shows you the media's genius. In fact, probably if I was the media, I'd do it the same way. I hate to say it. But we got to get them straightened out.
GROSS: In this election, the issue of abortion isn't being discussed nearly as much as it has been in recent previous presidential campaigns. You've described yourself as pro-life. In your political agenda, how would you rate the importance of, say, abortion compared to, say, campaign finance reform? Where do you see abortion fitting in?
KING: NPR's Asma Khalid. Thanks, Asma.
The view from China of Trump? Yan Xuetong, dean of Tsinghua University's Institute of Modern International Relations, told The New Yorker:
The climate crisis is a reproductive crisis
Meadows did not take it as a threat. And he thinks if anyone can bring this home and close out this deal, it's the president. But at the moment, Meadows remains a no vote, and while he refused to get into numbers, Meadows claimed there are enough people who agree with him to bring the bill down. The president, he said, is aware of a vote count issue, and he believes Trump remains open to negotiating changes that could move people like Meadows to vote for the bill.
But it continues to be a bumpy ride for investors. By late Thursday morning, GameStop shares had fallen 63% to $126 after some brokers imposed trading limits on the stock. The stock later recovered but closed at $193.60 — a 44% loss.
I like to think I'll be back. I've written down a ten year plan. I'll work for a few years abroad, here in the United States, or somewhere in Europe, and build my career. Then, when my resume is appealing enough, I'll move back and be of use. It's a plan that comes less out of patriotic duty, and more out of a refusal to accept displacement. Yes, that's my dream, to work in the country where I grew up.
Editor's note: NPR will also be fact-checking Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's planned economic speech this Thursday.
And how come Hunter gets three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow's wife, and gets hundreds of thousands of dollars to sit on an energy board, even though he admits he has no knowledge of energy? And millions of dollars up front.
Some large metropolitan areas, such as Philadelphia and St. Louis, overlap two or more states. The study looked at what happens when one of those states changes its corporate tax rate, and how it affects different parts of the region.
COSTA: It's a moment of choosing for many Republicans in Washington. Donald Trump is coming here to the capital. He's going to be at Jones Day Law Firm meeting with several lawmakers and longtime party operatives. And many of them feel, as much as they find him not really a normal Republican, they do see him as someone who could perhaps rouse working-class voters and someone who's really about to become the presumptive nominee. And so there's this awkward moment where they don't really like Trump, but they're ready, in some quarters, to rally around him.
LIASSON: What a turnaround for Joe Biden. This race is not decided yet. But Joe Biden's coalition appears to be broad and durable. His lead, if not insurmountable, is getting very, very hard to overcome. And Bernie Sanders' coalition once again failed to show up, particularly young voters. He had said that he was going to be able to turn them out in huge numbers, but they just haven't been doing that.
The reasons for these smaller refunds vary. For most people, it's because each paycheck has grown slightly, thanks to reduced withholding. On balance, they are likely to come out ahead.
HORSLEY: There wasn't a lot of certainty. This is still more of an outline than an actual plan. If the idea was meant to reassure financial markets, it had the opposite effect. The futures market is indicating another big drop in U.S. stocks today. It does look as if both Congress and the administration are now taking the economic threat posed by the coronavirus outbreak seriously, but they don't yet have a coordinated plan to address it.
GREEN: OK, so the first thing that we would have to do is to take more data than just your financial data. We collect, not just the stuff that's coming out of your bank, which a great many other tools like Mint and Quicken do - but we also look at the data that's part of your social networks. And we look at something that some of the real Ph.D.-types call human telemetrics. That we are effectively monitoring the things around you - who you're with, how much time you're spending with them, what applications you might have used on your phone, that sort of thing.

And they could use Rudy back in New York City. Rudy. They could use you. Your city's going to hell. They want Rudy Giuliani back in New York. We'll get a little younger version of Rudy. Is that OK, Rudy?
Sometimes not talking about things means that there's more flexibility, more opportunity, she says. And in this case, that means more opportunity for groups such as hers to influence the debate, especially as Congress works on upcoming spending bills.
TUBBS: So from now until June, we'll do a community engagement process to come up with the selection criterion for the families who will be selected. Those families will receive $500 a month for the next year to 18 months with the idea to really elevate the story of working-class people everywhere. People are working very hard and struggling and unable to make basic ends meet. So we were able to get a grant of $1 million from the Economic Security Project to really test this idea.
So this - health care is still a real issue here. As you say, hospitals right now are all running on emergency power, which are diesel-fueled generators. The hospital I visited yesterday had run out of power and actually had to discharge patients earlier this week because they didn't have any electricity on at all. So the - it's a real problem here.
Job-based coverage has remained stable even as annual increases in insurance premiums for individual plans reached double-digit percentages and enrollments missed expectations, pressuring the health insurance market despite the support of government subsidies.
I think there's a gap in the understanding in Washington D.C. and policymakers of what rural needs really are, and what rural really is, St. Germaine says.
Swonk warned the growing outbreak is, feeding into the fears that people have out there, which is a tax on the global economy itself. She says if those fears trigger lasting changes in behavior, that will make a speedy economic recovery more difficult.
Congress and the Trump administration could boost insurance coverage by a couple of million people and lower premiums by taking a few actions to stabilize the Affordable Care Act insurance markets, according to a new analysis by the consulting firm Oliver Wyman.
Steward Health Care, which operates Carney Hospital, says the changes will also include the creation of negative pressure patient wards.
INSKEEP: Arthur Laffer, it's been a pleasure. Thanks very much.
Now, there are a few proposals that seem most likely to be enacted. One would add some sort of security requirement when you request an absentee by mail vote in the future, such as writing your driver's license ID number or sending in a photocopy of your ID when you request a ballot.
Ultimately, the GOP-lean of the state which Trump won by 21 points and Gianforte's deep pockets still looks like too much for Democrats to overcome. But, like Kansas, this one could take on a life of its own late in the game.
For context, the figures in that above graph aren't huge numbers — 8,000 or 9,000 new Canadian permanent residents from the U.S., out of the roughly 260,000 total people getting permanent residency in Canada each year, aren't that many. Not to mention 8,000 or 9,000 out of nearly 320 million total Americans. And a few thousand is certainly far fewer than however many people are driving those spikes in Google searches.
SIMON: Now, I understand South Dakota doesn't have an income tax. So is that why collecting sales tax is particularly important to your state?

LOWREY: What's happening is that the out-of-pocket cost for health care, the price of higher education, the price of child care and the price of housing, whether you are looking to buy or rent - all of those prices are increasing faster than wage growth. So this is a huge problem in those high-productivity, high-cost coastal cities. It is hitting the suburbs. And it is hitting Bertie County, N.C., and Irion County, Texas, too. There are reports finding that people are spending more than half of their income on housing in those rural places, as well. And so every place is feeling less affordable. And that's really not a trend that we've seen before. And it's really squeezing a lot of families.
There are parts of the economy that will be impacted, especially workers who need to be at home, hardworking people who are at home under quarantine or taking care of their family. We'll be working on a program to address that, he said. We will also be working with small businesses.

She argues that what we do on Twitter around politics isn't a conversation at all; it's a loud mess.
The administration is appealing this latest district court ruling in the almost yearlong legal battle to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, according to a court filing released on Monday. The ruling is likely to be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court.
But even if Trump can't repeal the Affordable Care Act in its entirety, there's a lot he can do through rule-making and smaller legislative changes to weaken the law and mold it more to his liking.
Will he really be turning over a new leaf of bipartisan camaraderie and goodwill?
When the location of that room leaked on Twitter late Thursday morning, reporters filled the hallway outside the room's door on the first floor of the U.S. Capitol. Pallone, along with his Democratic House colleagues Jan Schakowsky, from Illinois, and Joseph Crowley, from New York, also stopped by.
Lawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown University, put his assessment more bluntly: It may have political value but [it] has zero public health value.
It was Vice President Pence's motorcade driving by. He was back on Capitol Hill for the second time this week, meeting with fellow Republicans to talk and pitch the health care bill.
Political parties have a very strong instinct for their own preservation. So, when a political party is taking a position that marginalizes it, it tends to self-correct, he said. It evolves, it adapts, it becomes what it has to become in order to win and therefore survive.
MCEVERS: Was the Charles Evans Foundation OK with the fact that the money went through Trump onto the Palm Beach Police?
They're the same promises he made to his customers at Trump Condos in Baja California. You should hear these people's stories. They handed over their savings. Then their calls stopped getting answered. The condos were never built, and they never got their money back.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, Kevin, do you think that the GOP health care bill, as passed, really does the best for the majority of Americans?
Zacher, chair of the Colorado Independent Venue Association, has been advising local businesses to get their paperwork ready and books lined up. But, he adds, while preparation might make businesses feel better, it's the money they really need.
Still, Aviv sees a silver lining in the fact that the president-elect has said so little about poverty.
Ivanka Trump said, Continuing to make sure we fund the programs adequately is key, while also talking up the increase in the child tax credit included in the Republican tax law passed in late 2017.
TUBBS: Thank you so much for having me.
Then there's the Estate Tax, which Trump wants to eliminate altogether. If you believe that he's as wealthy as he says, that alone would save the Trump family $4 billion. But it would do nothing for 99.8 percent of Americans. Let me repeat that: the Trump family gets a $4 billion tax cut... and 99.8 percent of Americans get nothing.
Appraisals are going on right now and many of our commercial businesses, the values have really gone down, said Williams. So we're bracing for another 10% hit. And then: we don't know.
The bill is modeled after legislation that played a role in Shell's decision to begin construction of a multi-billion dollar petrochemical plant in Beaver County. This measure is aimed at attracting investment in north central and northeastern Pennsylvania.
In January, the White House announced its American Rescue Plan, a $1.9 trillion relief package that aims to bolster the country's recovery from the pandemic. On Wednesday, Congress gave final approval to that legislation, which will send a new round of financial support to Americans in the form of direct payments, extended unemployment benefits and an expanded child tax credit.
Authorities in Italy are considering shutting down every single school and university in the country to stop COVID-19 from spreading. Italy was one of the first countries outside of China to see people infected, and cases around the world have now been traced back to Italy. NPR's Sylvia Poggioli is on the line from Rome.
SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel.
I could not have been clearer about taxing the wealthy, taxing corporations, the need for comprehensive congestion pricing, the need for a polluters' tax in order to hold fossil fuel companies accountable when they poison our communities.
SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: This is a story about Donald Trump and haircuts, not Trump's own famous do. In this case, haircut is a financial term for the sacrifice a lender agrees to make when a borrower can't repay everything he owes. Trump was on the phone last week with CNBC's Squawk Box program when co-host Andrew Ross Sorkin posed a provocative question - should the U.S. government demand a haircut from the lenders holding $19 trillion dollars in federal debt?

This has been a heart-breaking decision, said David Saggau, the company's CEO, speaking by video to the North Dakota Lignite Council, which represents North Dakota's mining industry. Yet Saggua told the miners that he had little choice, because the coal plant couldn't compete with cheaper electricity from other sources, mainly natural gas.
OCASIO-CORTEZ: Yeah. I think the first thing that we need to do is kind of break the mistaken idea that taxes pay for a hundred percent of government expenditure. It's just not how government expenditure works. We can recoup costs, but oftentimes you look at, for example, the GOP tax cut, which I think was an irresponsible use of government expenditure. But government projects are often financed by a combination of taxes, deficit spending and other kinds of investments - you know, bonds and so on.

Still, Richard Wall, who owns Both Ways Café and Catering, in Seattle, has questions. How would Medicare for All's coverage compare with the insurance he currently gets through his wife's employer? He's unsure.

But when we win, as we did in Colorado and in Minnesota and in Michigan, these are - and New Hampshire - these are battleground states, which Democrats have to win. We have already won them.
And while Band, a longtime aide to Bill Clinton, never worked for State, he also held multiple roles within the Clintons' orbit. As Eric Lichtblau of The New York Times recently explained it to NPR:
Already, presidential candidates are being asked whether they support the idea of a Green New Deal, meaning it's easy to see the issue becoming a litmus test for some voters in both the 2020 congressional elections and the presidential election.
A small tax — 0.1% — on each Wall Street trade would reduce high frequency trading, a practice which drains profits from retail investors and benefits only the very rich, tweeted Congresswoman Ilhan Omar during the GameStop firestorm.
In addition, it's easy to see how the bill could be dangerous for moderate House Democrats, many of whom come from swing districts and may be loath to touch such a progressive proposal.

The problem is that it's hard to know for sure. Changing countries is a major, complicated decision, and a lot of factors can play into it. Another lawyer said he thinks economics — and not politics — likely explains a lot of this movement.
Still, offering insurance can be a big expense for employers. Myers estimates 10% of his payroll goes to health care. His business is too small to bargain with the insurance company. So each year, the price goes up – and how much it goes up can vary.

MCCAIN: Well, I think it was different in many respects because this was a paid-for ad campaign. What happened to us was all sort of under-the-radar kind of thing. In the campaign you're talking about in South Carolina, I think that the media can play a more instructive role. Maybe if the media had exposed some of this stuff more widely, we could have done a better job. And maybe we should have done a better job in exposing it.
The spread of coronavirus is the U.S. is highlighting just how precarious the gig economy can be.

In January, President Biden signed an executive order to open up the federal health insurance marketplace for three months starting Monday so uninsured people can buy a plan and those who want to change their marketplace coverage can do so.
Right now, when a corporation outsources jobs and production, it can write off the costs. We should stop that, and instead make them give back tax breaks they received here at home.

McDonald's is one of the nation's biggest employers of low-wage workers. As such, it was kind of the perfect place to launch what was, in retrospect, the beginning of a historic labor movement.

You know, I happen to think we should be ambitious. While we're at it, let's connect every household to broadband by the year 2020. It's astonishing to me how many places in America not way way far away from cities but in cities and near cities that don't have access to broadband. And that disadvantages kids who are asked to do homework using the Internet; 5 million of them live in homes without access to the Internet. So you talk about an achievement gap, it starts right there. And let's build a cleaner, more resilient power grid with enough renewable energy to power every home in our country as well.
There likely will be some agreement on other measures, like those small business loans. And they certainly - both lawmakers and the White House certainly share the goal of helping workers who don't have sick leave and are forced to stay home because of the outbreak, although it's not clear that they're on the same page when it comes to how to accomplish that.
MARTIN: Does the president risk anything with his base when he makes remarks like this about a war hero? - I mean, especially with veterans who support the president.
SAGAL: I - from what he's told me, he'll do anything you ask.

SELYUKH: In Pickering's garage are shingles she'd bought to patch a little hole in her roof that occasionally leaks into a bucket underneath. But she had to cancel on the roofer, who is now an unsuspecting victim of the decline in travel. Still, Pickering has her yard, the fresh air outside and those three dogs she gets to walk who are blissfully unaware, she says, and still happy about the same things that always made them happy.
WARREN: Look - I'm not here to criticize other candidates; I'm here to talk about why I'm running. And for me, it's the fight of my life. On...
TED Talk? Late-night infomercial? Nope — it was House Speaker Paul Ryan, making a hard pitch for his health care plan after a week of loud conservative criticism.
INSKEEP: And happy New Year. What are you seeing in the numbers?
No. That's what my wife and I - both teachers - told our younger son when he was considering becoming a teacher.
It is really important that voters in Ohio and across America understand this, she exposes him for what he is — temperamentally unfit and unqualified to be president of the United States.
But a lot of it is concerted efforts to force institutions to de-platform people, he said. It's firing people for imagined or very minor offenses because of sort of online media mobs and so on.
The administration has requested a $45.8 billion package of assistance that includes funding for a wide array of agencies and programs, from Amtrak to the Veterans Administration, and for needs ranging from disinfecting buildings and airports, to protective clothing for federal workers and tablets to allow for increased telework by federal employees.
We were so happy, she says. This is a very simple practical thing that we can do in order to make necessary medical products more accessible to women in our community.
But Olson says another provision of the measure could be a bit more complicated. It's the new, monthly, child tax credit of up to $300 per child that Democrats included in the bill, which the IRS is going to have to figure out how to implement.
Drug giant Bayer says it is making millions of doses of its version of this drug available in the U.S. And another experimental drug, Remdesivir, is not approved for any use, but it is already being tested in numerous clinical trials. And FDA commissioner again suggested the company that makes it, Gilead, could make it available to patients using an established mechanism called compassionate use. Again, we don't know if this drug is effective.

Biden also dissolved Trump's 1776 Commission, which claimed the left-wing rioting and mayhem are the direct result of decades of left-wing indoctrination in our schools. It was an apparent rebuttal to the New York Times' 1619 Project, which examined how slavery shaped American society in the 400 years since the first slaves were brought to the American colonies.
Salahi said getting the payments into inmate bank accounts has been a significant challenge.
Big companies can hire benefits consultants and managers who arrange and administer employee insurance. Owners of very small businesses and restaurants might otherwise decide to let employees fend for themselves. (Under the ACA, only employers who have the equivalent of 50 or more full-time workers incur penalties if they don't offer health benefits.)

If he wants to make America great again, maybe he should start by actually making things in America again.
[Bringing jobs back from overseas is a major theme of Trump's campaign that has resonated with many voters around the country. On the issue of energy, Trump primarily focuses on reviving older energy sources like coal and promoting fracking, though he has talked about advocating clean coal technology.An analysis by Scientific American found that Trump's promise to bring back closed coal mines would be difficult to fulfill, both because of environmental regulations and economic shifts -Sarah McCammon]
Part of the rule requires reconciliation bills be confined to changing spending and revenue. It bars extraneous policies from being included in reconciliation. Any policy needs to be directly budget related.
So, if Twitter is a bunch of Post-it notes thrown on the ground, we now have to consider which of those notes are even real.
And Biden has an ambitious agenda — a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief plan, requiring a $15 federal minimum wage, an immigration overhaul addressing the millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally, not to mention trying to lead a dialogue on race in America.
The plan would also extend a federal moratorium on evictions through September and provide $30 billion in additional aid to struggling renters.
Why Is Facebook Launching An All-Out War On Apple's Upcoming iPhone Update?
MANN: People are scared. I mean, in much of the country, including here in New York City, where I am now, coronavirus feels still kind of unreal. It's invisible, people not sure how big a deal it's going to be. But there in New Rochelle, it is changing people's lives right now. People keep getting sick. I spoke yesterday with Rita Mabli, who runs one of the nursing homes in the area where visitors have been banned from seeing their loved ones.
LAFFER: In this case, yes, I do believe so. And if we lower that tax rate, I think we will have no more inversions, No. 1.

Varela says he loves using Hispandering to call out politicians and brands for what he sees as cheap attempts to grab Latino votes and dollars. He says behind the pun is a genre of sharp critique by Latino political observers and commentators.
Puerto Rico is one of five inhabited U.S. territories, along with American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands. People of these territories (except some in American Samoa) are U.S. citizens, pay federal taxes such as Social Security and Medicare – but not federal income tax — and can freely travel within the U.S.
PAVIOUR: The big companies argue there's enough room in the market for everyone, including smaller social equity applicants.
GONYEA: Afterward, Sanders doesn't hang around long, taking selfies like most other candidates do. He works the rope line for a bit then exits out a back door. But the audience is clearly energized by this 78-year-old candidate.
Leaders of the unions representing the plant workers say the company has been gradually shifting production to plants in India, Brazil and Thailand for some time.
KIM: Well, in some ways. And in some ways, it means that there will be a continuity. There was a lot of uncertainty in Russia about what happens after 2024. And what Putin is doing right now is he's setting a clear signal - I'm staying in power, and this is how I'm going to do it.
The Souvenir is a heartbreaker, but not a tear-jerker. And Julie's love life is just one of many things that make her interesting.

[Thirty-six percent of African-Americans under 18 were below the poverty line as of 2014, according to the Census Bureau. It's not entirely clear what Trump means by not employed, which is not technically the same as unemployed, which counts people who aren't working and are looking for work. However, the unemployment rate for black Americans ages 16 to 19 was 38.1 percent as of June. — Danielle Kurtzleben]
JOSEPH BRUSUELAS: These are highly-paid professionals with educations who aren't receiving income who are going to see at least - at this point, at least two paychecks missed by these individuals. That's an entire month of pay.
The dollar is down nearly 10 percent since the beginning of the year. That's bad news if you're a tourist traveling to Europe, but great news if your U.S. company sells goods overseas.
HARARI: Yes, I think, again, that this crisis can to result in the destruction of organized labor completely. Or we can just reverse the trend and people realizing the importance of having a social safety net, of having a government-sponsored health care system. It can go either way. This is the most important thing people need to realize is that we have a lot of choices. And very important decisions are going to be taken in the next month or two. It's a short window of opportunity when history is moving into - in fast forward. It's accelerating. Governments are willing to experiment to try ideas which previously would have sounded crazy. And once this is over, the order will solidify again.
ALLEN: Well, they clearly welcome this TPS order. This is something they've been looking for for many years. And certainly under the four years of President Trump, they were always asking for this, although he courted the Venezuelan American vote here in Florida and elsewhere, he wouldn't extend TPS, you know, here or in many other countries. It's something they just refused to do. Instead, in his final hours as president, he kind of surprised people with that Deferred Enforced Departure order that did some of the same things as TPS but, you know, doesn't go that full route. I talked to Ernesto Ackerman. He heads a Venezuelan activist group here. And like many Venezuelan Americans, he supported President Trump in the election. But he thinks Biden's now playing catch-up with this group of Venezuelan American voters.
Lightfoot, the former head of the Chicago Police Board, will also have to manage the ongoing task of reforming the Chicago Police Department. That process, launched after the Laquan McDonald shooting scandal, has been fraught with tension between City Hall and the Chicago police union.
This is the biggest-ticket item for the NRA and it's the most likely to happen. Trump, a concealed-carry-permit holder, has said that concealed carry is a right, not a privilege, and that a permit should be valid in all 50 states, similar to a driver's license.
With tax legislation behind him, President Trump could make some major decisions this month on another economic promise - reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China. That's the figure that measures how much Chinese imports exceed American exports. And the gap grew during Trump's first year in office. Here he is on his visit to China this past fall.
In recent days, the fastest growth of new coronavirus cases has come outside of China – particularly in South Korea, Italy, Iran and Japan.
In this moment of crisis, they sent a really important signal that the actions of the objectors were unacceptable ... because what they were doing was voting to overturn the will of the voters, McGehee said.
I have been one of those women who actually craved to have a baby, says Sadiye Rieder, smiling as she sits next to her husband in the sunroom of their Maryland home. To go through pregnancy and everything, that mattered to me a lot.
The question is — does this have staying power, or is it going to be a move of the moment? Freed said. What do they do in six months? ... Is this a real epiphany moment in terms of a change in how companies approach their political spending?
In the NPR poll, 45 percent of Americans said the economy has improved under Trump, who inherited an upward economic trajectory from former President Barack Obama. The economy didn't grow as quickly in the final quarter of 2017 as many economists had projected, though. And the stock market's triple-digit tumble on Tuesday just hours before Trump's speech will certainly cast a pall over any Wall Street highs that the president could tout.
Rodriguez recently asked California state lawmakers to extend hate crime protections to people experiencing homelessness after a few violent incidents against homeless people. Those are rare cases, but Rodriguez says she worries generally about anger towards L.A.'s homeless community. Not only for humanitarian reasons, but because homeless housing and services often depend on public dollars and public support.

The new version comes after the Congressional Budget Office found that the original BCRA would in the next decade increase the uninsured population by 22 million over what it would otherwise be. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had hoped for a vote before July 4, but was forced to delay that because he couldn't garner the 50 votes he needed among the 52 GOP senators.
Since COVID-19 has scarcely existed as a recognized disease for that long, this may be hard to prove, Landry says. She would like to see the SSA put out specialized guidance about COVID-19, similar to guidance the agency has released in the past for applicants suffering from debilitating headaches or fibromyalgia.
The midterm elections are just over two months away, and Democrats are enthused - all sorts of Democrats, judging by primaries and special elections so far. There's Conor Lamb, a pro-gun Marine veteran who won a House special election in Pennsylvania this spring, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a democratic socialist who unseated a 10-term incumbent in her New York primary this summer. And it's not just marines and socialists. In Ohio, Senator Sherrod Brown is seeking re-election as an outspoken progressive who is cheering President Trump's tough stance on trade with China. We're joined now by two Democratic strategists who we hope can tell us where the party is heading and what it stands for - Jeff Weaver, who managed Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign. Good morning.
Two years ago, L.A. voters overwhelmingly passed Measure HHH, a city bond to fund homeless housing. In 2017, they passed a county-wide sales tax increase called Measure H, to fund various homeless services. Despite all this new money flowing to a number of projects, tens of thousands of men and women still sleep on the streets. The situation has led to increasing impatience among some voters.

INSKEEP: So that helicopter, the green and white helicopter, rises over Washington, D.C. He gets - along with first lady Melania Trump, they get a last look at the Mall. They fly over the inauguration that the president, in a break with tradition, is skipping. He goes to Joint Base Andrews, a military base just outside of Washington. And he gave a sort of departure speech there to a couple hundred family members and staffers and supporters, gave a somewhat inflated view of his presidency and also said this.

The other thing I think is really important to point out is unemployment insurance. This bill includes $600 in additional unemployment insurance for people who have lost their jobs due to the coronavirus. Now, that lasts for four months, and that is on top of whatever the state is currently paying unemployed people. There's also an expansion to gig workers, people who are on contracts, who are freelancers. And that expansion to allow them to collect unemployment lasts through the end of the year.

But it is an incredibly important symbol. It bolsters his image as a guy who'll stand up for American workers against big business the way John F. Kennedy did a couple generations ago with steel people. And it suggests to me that he's going to be willing in a very non-Republican way to restrain employers whose ability to hire and fire and move production has been largely unfettered. I mean, he's doing things that the socialist president of France does when somebody threatens to close a plant there.

But passing permanent programs will likely be much more difficult because they will require bipartisan agreement in the Senate.

KEITH: The reconciliation process is not an easy one. It starts with something that in many years Congress simply hasn't done, which is pass a budget. In this case, it has to be a budget that both Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin can agree to. Democrats have the narrowest majority possible in the Senate. They can't lose a single Democratic vote if they want to go it alone. And just as an indication that they might be concerned, last week, Vice President Harris did a bunch of local TV interviews to sell this COVID relief package in West Virginia and Arizona, where there are moderate senators who haven't signed on yet.

One week after the government put the country in lockdown, health officials stress that they do not expect to see a substantial decline in the number of positive cases until the end of next week, NPR's Sylvia Poggioli reports from Rome. After consultations with unions and business leaders, the government has announced a large economic aid package dubbed 'Heal Italy' to help families, workers and industries. It includes suspended tax payments, workers' compensation and export credits.
SMITH: Absolutely. We'd like to - it needs - it requires an investment in leadership by the federal government, and also investment then by state and local government and the private sector.

Trump leaves office with a 38% approval rating in the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, and Biden gets more positive reviews than Trump so far. A majority approve of how he handled the transition, think he'll do more to unify than divide and more people like him than don't, but not by much.

But we are finding out that Pete Buttigieg - Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., is enjoying a nice little bump. And while he was also on stage too, I think people did enjoy hearing from him but, at the same time, not quite the same reaction that Warren and Booker were receiving. But the poll numbers are in his favor, so that's, obviously, a very good sign in this state.
But Mike Bloomberg had a lot of things to do. Remember; this was the first time Democrats had a chance to see him as a candidate, not just a campaign commercial.

The Trump administration is considering alternative ways to pay for the border wall, backtracking on the president's oft-repeated promise that Mexico would foot the bill.

Mr. TAYLOR: (Reading) Available within the network will be functions and services to which you subscribe on a regular basis and others that you call for when you need them. In the former group will be investment guidance, tax counseling, selected dissemination of information in your field of specialization, announcement of cultural, sport and entertainment events that fit your interests, et cetera. In the latter group will be dictionaries, encyclopedias, indexes, catalogues, editing programs, teaching programs, testing programs, programming systems, databases and, most important, communication, display and modeling programs.
It's perhaps unhealthy for chattering classes (me included) to live partly within this 24-7 cocktail party that reinforces things that maybe shouldn't be reinforced and rewards facile conventional thinking rather than depth, Podhoretz continued. Twitter is a bubble, or is a world of cliques.
On Wednesday, the President offered his plans for the economy. He called for funds to provide low-interest loans to small businesses, to expand paid sick leave, and to delay tax day for certain people and businesses. He also called for a payroll tax cut which, while we don't have specific numbers, could be a massive amount of money.
CHANG: Now the president is reportedly considering the hard-line move of raising tariffs on some electronics from China. And Wendy Cutler says that could be a big mistake. She was a deputy U.S. trade representative under President Obama, but she told me that she agrees with the Trump administration on this point - that the U.S. should take some action against China.
Tonight, this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fate.

So many members, physicians and others in the health care world were stunned when Louis Gutierrez, who runs the exchange, said he couldn't guarantee coverage through the end of 2017 for the nearly 240,000 enrollees so far.
Brady believes he's making progress on winning over the president. But he acknowledges if he can't convince Trump to accept the border adjustment tax, with its $1.2 trillion in revenue, the big tax cuts Republicans want for businesses and individuals could be in danger.
We're gathered together in the heart of our nation's capital for one very, very basic and simple reason: To save our democracy.
CORNISH: E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and Brookings Institution, thank you so much.
He overpaid for all that stuff, said Res. Those were not wise decisions. Those were mistakes on his part.
And not a single swing state has conducted a comprehensive audit to remove the illegal ballots. This should absolutely occur in every single contested state before the election is certified.
There is no question — none — that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day, said McConnell, who noted he didn't vote to convict because he believes a former official can't be tried for impeachment.
JENNER: The answer is yes and no (laughter). There are certainly some simplifications in this bill that are well worthwhile. For example, raising the standard deduction for individuals is going to result in incredible simplification because it will mean that fewer people have to itemize. On the other hand, as I mentioned, you know, the pastorate provision, which is a signature piece of this bill, is incredibly complicated. So I would say that there are some very, very good simplifications in here and some provisions that are not too simple.
Pelosi's spokesman tweeted that the speaker and treasury secretary talked twice about language for the bill.
And that is the same demographic profile that makes up the backbone of what sometimes is called the resistance to Trump, the people who were out for the Women's March, the organizers and the small donors who brought, you know, 40-some House seats to Democrats last November. So what these political scientists are saying is there's some overlap in energy between the teachers unions and other social movements that we're seeing - political movements.
With officials estimating the cleanup could cost hundreds of millions of dollars, Spiegel - who runs an environmental group called the Edison Wetlands Association - says this is like a mini version of the oil spill in the Gulf.
FLONARD WRENCHER: It was a few years ago. I went to jail, and I couldn't get out. I couldn't get out because I couldn't afford to pay 7,500 bucks. I couldn't afford to pay that.
Ironically, one of the lessons of the 2012 presidential campaign was that Romney never took hold of his biography with early positive ads — and that left it to opponents to define him. Bush's team and supporters weren't going to make that same mistake with their candidate, who, similarly, was an early clear front-runner with a big potential problem — his last name.

MONTANARO: Right. There aren't a whole lot of specifics of how to get there, and it's certainly not something that Democratic leadership is going to want to try to put on the floor to try to put moderates in a potentially precarious position because, remember, Democrats did win the House on the backs of moderates because of a lot of those suburban districts that were held by Republicans previously.
That tuition price tag at MIT is technically about $50,000, even though students like Oostrom don't have to pay it. Under the tax plan proposed by House Republicans, these students would have to report that tuition forgiveness as income.

She does have this reputation for being zealous about guarding her privacy, and that leading to challenges, he noted. But the other thing is that she is being judged as the likely next president of the United States whereas her opponent often gets covered as kind of a sideshow and doesn't get the kind of scrutiny that she gets.
RASCOE: And he kept going. So that, to me, stood out. He definitely had more energy. We don't want to talk about low energy. He had more energy in this debate.

And we could also - the government could do more to resist market forces by redistribution, raising taxes on the rich and increasing government benefits like the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-wage workers. That would reduce the inequality that is generated by the market.

GREENE: Are you proud of that record?
Trump hedges his call for multistate plans by saying they would have to comply with regulations in each state where they are offered. It's hard to see how, if states continue to regulate insurance differently, the theoretical benefits he touts could be achieved in practice. In fact, over the years six states, including Georgia, enacted laws to encourage insurance sales across their borders, and a Georgetown University analysis found that they failed to attract new plans into their markets.

According to the report, 2.5 billion disposable cups are tossed out each year in Britain alone, and that number is expected to rise given the growth of coffee shops in the U.K. in recent years. (There are more than four times as many coffee shops today as there were in 2000.)
Members of Congress have said they want to loosen rules for health savings accounts. Did they do it in the latest spending bill? Do people who were uncovered for one month in 2017 owe a tax penalty?

Leading Republicans in Congress have vowed that even if they repeal most of the Affordable Care Act early in 2017, a replacement won't hurt those now receiving benefits.
With Price's confirmation, HHS now has as its leader a budget hawk who has proposed replacing the Affordable Care Act subsidies that are tied to income, with tax credits to purchase insurance. Tax credits are not determined by an individual's income level.

LAFFER: Yeah, an income tax or payroll tax, which is what Al Gore has always suggested whenever he's talked about a carbon tax. I think he's brilliant on this issue. The fear I have with a carbon tax is that if it's a standalone, it'll kill the economy. This is what Congress should be doing - is trying to find common ground. I mean, I think bipartisanship is very important.
Pushing away those who are supremely loyal to Trump would seem to be out of the question, since they represent such a big chunk of the party's base. But Reed thinks the party can address their concerns and convince them that in a democracy, it's possible for the Republican Party to lose a legitimate election.
Now critics, including some aligned with big Republican contributors like the Koch brothers, say, wait a minute. To a great extent, U.S. consumers will bear the brunt of a tax on imports. They'll end up paying higher prices for things like imported cars, clothes and food. Businesses that import products could also be hurt, including businesses from retailers and petroleum refineries, including those owned by Koch Industries.

And then you couple that with the spending that came into being once the super majority and the Obama administration came in and people said enough is enough.

So they are going into the tax reform fight hobbled. And I would say that there is less consensus on what tax reform would look like. There's more opposition to it from lobbying forces. And they face the same problem they faced on health care. Can they find a governing coalition to pass anything in the House of Representatives?
KAHN: Well, earlier this month, Guatemala's highest court had blocked the President Jimmy Morales from signing any international migration treaties. They wanted - they said that he had to have approval from Congress. Opponents of the president who say that he's increasingly using executive powers to - unlawfully - brought the case to the high court there. And I talked to some of them about the deal, and they said it's unclear even if the interior minister, who signed the agreement in the Oval Office yesterday, had the authority to do that and whether the high court's ban had been violated.
As more lawmakers test positive for the virus and even more self-quarantine because of possible exposure, Congress itself is racing a clock to pass a bill and likely recess for at least a few weeks. While some lawmakers continue to call for allowing remote voting in the House and Senate, both Pelosi and McConnell remain resistant to the idea, which has never been done before, would require votes to change the rules of both chambers and could face constitutional challenges.

And so I gave chase to the robber who had just held up a woman who was making a deposit. Then he got caught by a police officer, swung at him with his knife. Thank God it only ripped his shirt. And I came upon the situation while the officer had drawn his gun on a crowded sidewalk and just thought to myself this is a bad situation. And very imprudently, I decided I didn't want the officer to shoot so that I would sprint at the man with the knife. And he fortunately did what I hoped he would do, which is not to stand there but actually turn and run.

As the Wall Street Journal noted, President Obama has issued close to four hundred new major regulations since taking office, each with a cost to the American economy of $100 million or more. In 2015 alone, the Obama Administration unilaterally issued more than 2,000 new regulations – each a hidden tax on American consumers, and a massive lead weight on the American economy. It is time to remove the anchor dragging us down, and that's what it's doing - it's dragging us down. Upon taking office, I will issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations.
HORSLEY: Well, Rubio won some concessions on the child tax credit for working-class families. That makes the credit a little bit more valuable for lower-income parents who don't pay a whole lot in federal taxes. Some of his Republican colleagues had been saying they couldn't afford that. Rubio countered that they were able to afford a lower tax rate for people making more than half a million dollars. And he held out for a more generous tax credit. He got it. Advocates for the poor, however, complain that the measure still doesn't go far enough.

But a tax overhaul, which again hasn't been done in 30 years, is hard enough without attaching a $1 trillion infrastructure plan and a $500 billion child-care tax credit.
SIMON: As the former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, how do you see the responsibility of the administration in times like this when we're so sensitive to what's happening on Wall Street?
Also, it would probably be a little, um, American of us to assume that our politics are the only things driving people over the border.

HORSLEY: It's not clear how that would work, though, since the cash-strapped government would have to borrow more money at rising interest rates to buy back its old debt. Holtz-Eakin was left scratching his head.
Schumer stayed on and did such a good job that Reid begged him to stay on for another term. In that 2006 election cycle, Schumer raised a ton of money. He - the DSCC saw its contributions from Wall Street increase by 50%, and they picked up six seats that cycle. Then the following cycle, 2008, part of the Barack Obama wave, Senate Democrats picked up eight seats. So people thought that Schumer was walking on water. He was a magician. He was the genius.

The administration is seeking $73 million for the Peace Corps to cover the costs of evacuating more than 6,000 volunteers and 177 U.S. employees from Peace Corps posts worldwide.
In his opinion, however, Hazel found that the administration manufactured that reasoning. He echoed the earlier ruling in California by U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg, who wrote that the enforcement of the civil rights law is nothing more than a pretext designed to provide cover for the Secretary's unexplained desire to add the citizenship question to the census.
These are the facts that you won't hear from the fake news media. It's all part of the suppression effort. They don't want to talk about it. They don't want to talk about it. In fact, when I started talking about that, I guarantee you, a lot of the television sets and a lot of those cameras went off. And that's a lot of cameras back there. But a lot of them went off.
Fishman adds that being in jail often leads to increased poverty, because many jails charge fees to their inmates. That pass-through [in] jails is damaging and has huge repercussions, she says. You're talking about people who often come in in fragile economic situations and end up that much worse by the time they get out.
These speeches aren't necessarily just on the president, but on certain issues, Flake said. The first one will be on the need to have shared facts that we all agree on.
YOUNG: It's not toxic in the sense that it's toxic because we're not getting things done. The chairman used to run the Congress, not the president, not the speaker. Now, everything's run through Nancy's office or run through Ryan's office. And in doing so, it becomes a party policy instead of solving a problem. There is no problem that's a Republican problem or a Democrat problem or a progressive problem, depends on what you want to call them. But there is a problem, and no one can solve it 100 percent their way. They have to do it together or it'll never get solved. And what's happened now, it has to be 100 percent Republican or 100 percent Democrat. No wants to sit down and say, OK, well, how can we solve the problem? You have to give up a little bit. I have to give up a little bit. The problem's solved.

We need to take — we need to take that frustration, the fear, the anxiety, and yes, the anger, and after we have vented it, we need to work together to achieve the kind of changes that will give everybody in this country a better shot.
Senators can offer endless amendments without any further debate. There are no limits on how many amendments each person can offer, no limits on how many each party can offer.
Some of that weight is about to be lifted. Included in President Biden's $1.9 trillion relief package is a provision that provides many American parents an allowance of $250 a month for each child and $300 for kids under 6.
As far as social programs, Trump is correct here that there was some spending — a substantial portion of the stimulus went to this category of spending: $40 billion went to unemployment insurance, along with $25 billion to COBRA health coverage and $20.9 billion to SNAP (sometimes referred to as food stamps), according to The New York Times' rundown of stimulus spending, and there were plenty of other, smaller social programs as well.

The news that China's economy is now the world's second largest is a reminder of that country's phenomenal growth based on exports and the historic migration of millions of Chinese from the countryside to the cities. But it's also a reminder of another less impressive economic phenomenon. China's $5 trillion economy moved into second place behind our nearly $15 trillion economy because Japanese economic growth was especially slow in the second quarter and Japan dropped into third.

SMITH: ....Culture change. That's us. That's all of us. We use infrastructure, and we've got to pay for it. One of the things that we talk about is transportation. That's a big part of the funding gap for infrastructure. Right now, the federal gas tax hasn't been increased since 1993. It's 18.5 cents a gallon. It was increased under Clinton. It was increased under H.W. Bush. It was increased under Reagan. But it hasn't been increased since 1993, and we're trying to pay for current infrastructure with those dollars.
The Internal Revenue Service was suing UBS AG to get the identities of Americans with secret accounts. If the case proceeded, Switzerland's largest bank would face an impossible choice: Violate Swiss secrecy laws by handing over the names, or refuse and face criminal charges in U.S. federal court. Within months, Mrs. Clinton announced a tentative legal settlement — an unusual intervention by the top U.S. diplomat. UBS ultimately turned over information on 4,450 accounts, a fraction of the 52,000 sought by the IRS, an outcome that drew criticism from some lawmakers who wanted a more extensive crackdown. From that point on, UBS's engagement with the Clinton family's charitable organization increased. Total donations by UBS to the Clinton Foundation grew from less than $60,000 through 2008 to a cumulative total of about $600,000 by the end of 2014, according to the foundation and the bank.

With the collapse of the Republicans' health care bill, we consider the impact on Arizona, a state where many have benefited from Obamacare, but others have been hard hit by rising insurance premiums.
The goal, after all, of any truly great legislator has always been to see problems and come up with constructive solutions. Instead, the GOP continues to have growing pains in overcoming its image as the party of no in the Obama years. Unfortunately for Republicans, now they're saying no to themselves.

No significant legislation to lower drug prices got all the way through Congress in 2019. On the House side, Democrats passed a landmark bill on drug prices in December, but it is unlikely to pass a Republican-controlled Senate. A bipartisan effort on the Senate side, which has the support of the White House, has not won over Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, so its prospects for passage this year are not great.
There is, in my mind, very, very few things - or are very few things - that are as dangerous as driving at 65 miles an hour down a road you've never been down before and looking to make a turn, and yet we trust a piece of software with our lives to effectively tell us which lane to be in, how fast to go and whether or not to turn right or left at the next light. That's no different in a lot of ways to what we're starting to see happen with personal finance software and, in fact, some of this Quantified Self stuff too, where we're trusting machines to do a little bit more analysis than we can do or have a slightly better point of view than we have right now and be able to guide us around a bit.

Formal regulations would take time to undo, because they must follow a lengthy process allowing for public comment. But there are several measures Trump could take on Day One of his presidency to cripple the law's effectiveness.
But I would just say that of the various stimulus programs that we're doing, I think the unemployment benefits is an important one, especially from our sense of fairness - that, you know, we have a society, we have an economy, which is pretty rough-and-tumble, capitalist economy. There should be some social safety net. It's important to strengthen that and enhance it temporarily.

Talking about the establishment and who is in it seems to be all anyone cares about this election. We tried to track how much the party establishments were talked about in major newspapers.

Assuming your parents haven't worked for at least 10 years in the United States, they're probably not eligible for premium-free hospitalization coverage under Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people age 65 and older, Gonzales says.

So where does network science come in? A network is any collection of entities and the links between them (think webpages and links on the World Wide Web or people and their friendships in a social network).

Because Louail and Lenormand also had the amount of money being spent at the businesses, they could build a portrait of money flowing from one neighborhood to the other (or within a neighborhood).

I believe a child going without an education is tantamount to a crime, she says in the 2010 video. So I decided I was going to start prosecuting parents for truancy.
The motivation behind any 'pay-to-play' restriction is that certain groups and entities — because they stand to benefit from a very particular government action — can be regulated when they try to spend money or give money to influence an election, Graham says.
MARTIN: You don't think that's a good idea.
Still, no matter what the total percentage was, Clinton still sat down 40 people who had donated more than $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation, and 20 who had donated more than $1 million, according to the AP's tallies.

And while we are at it, we're going to raise the national minimum wage — $7.25 an hour is a poverty wage. Workers deserve better. They deserve a living wage and a job with dignity. Families deserve real support, like quality affordable child care, paid family leave and equal pay for women.
Bloomberg's four months as a candidate represented the most expensive presidential candidacy in history. He amassed a staff of more than 2,000 people, including an enormous field operation that he and his aides promised would work through November to defeat President Trump, no matter what.
I said give them $2,000, we'll pay it back. We'll pay it back fast. You already owe 26 trillion, give them a couple of bucks. Let them live. Give them a couple of bucks. And some of the people here disagree with me on that, but I just say, Look, you've got to let people live.

The president noted that his efforts to renegotiate NAFTA continue as well. We are renegotiating NAFTA as I said I would, and if we don't make a deal I will terminate NAFTA, he warned.
It is time for a wealth tax in America. That's a 2-cent tax on all the fortunes over $50 million, and that's the kind of thing that makes a real difference in this country. For a 2-cent wealth tax, we can provide universal child care and early education, universal pre-K for every child in this country. And we can raise the wages of every child-care worker. We can cancel student loan debt.
There is real journalistic value in being an observer at public events such as a march or rally, even without a reporting assignment. But while we may observe, we refrain from actively participating in marches, rallies or public events involving political issues or partisan causes that our organization covers or may cover. Of course, the distinction between being a participant and being an observer can be subtle. But waving a picket sign or joining along in a cheer would be inappropriate. Again, we rely on your good judgment.Since the nature of each event differs, it's wise to discuss these matters ahead of time with supervisors to figure out where ethical pressure points may exist or emerge. If attending such an event as an observer, take care in behavior, comments, attire and physical location not to reflect a participatory role.
Trump offered plenty of advice: advocating full repeal and then building another plan. He even declared that Democrats would jump on board.

In addition to changing social and cultural attitudes, conservative religious schools face a changing legal environment regarding LGBT issues. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.
The question now is whether this version of the bill could pass the Senate. Shortly after its release, Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul both said they intend to vote against letting the bill go forward. With two no votes, Vice President Pence could provide the 51st vote needed for passage. But if three Republican senators defect, the bill cannot pass.
MCCAMMON: Romney remains close with party leaders, including his former running mate, House Speaker Paul Ryan. The Party's 2008 nominee, John McCain, released a statement saying he shares Romney's concerns, although he said earlier this week he will back the party's nominee. And Trump hit back later in the day during a campaign stop in Maine.
ROMER: For the IRS, it might actually have cost more to bring Larry back in line than he ever owed them, but that doesn't mean it wasn't worth it. Let too many people like Larry Williams interpret the rules however they want to, and the whole tax system could stop working altogether. Keith Romer, NPR News.

So, let's set five ambitious goals for our economy. Let's break through the dysfunction in Washington, and make the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II.
Is A Corporate Tax Cut Really What The Economy Needs Right Now?
PAUL RYAN: Claiming a person can't do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment. I think that should be absolutely disavowed. It's absolutely unacceptable.
One of the Trump administration's biggest environmental rollbacks suffered a stunning setback Wednesday, as a decades-long push to drill for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ended with a lease sale that attracted just three bidders — one of which was the state of Alaska itself.
It's time to go, says Acevedo, who is president of the Orange County Landlord Association. How am I going to survive?
Frerichs says 529s were built on the idea of patience — of parents slowly saving for college — and that using them to pay for kindergarten is a significant change.
The Senate plan would still allow individuals earning up to $75,000 per year and couples earning up to $150,000 per year to receive the full benefit. But the payments would phase out more quickly and end entirely for individuals earning $80,000 or more and couples earning $160,000 or more. The cutoffs in the House bill were much higher, with individuals earning up to $100,000 and couples earning up to $200,000 still receiving some benefit.

Our legislation transfers power from Washington back to the states, said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, in a statement. We dismantle Obamacare's damaging taxes and mandates so states can deliver quality affordable options.
KEITH: So, as with every debate, there were a lot of things covered. There were also a lot of things that weren't covered. And there are a few stray moments that I feel like we should probably talk about. One of those was Vice President Biden, in a very long answer about schools and segregation - he started talking about turntables.
As we've reported, after Berkeley, Calif., passed a tax on sugary drinks, one study found that consumption of sugary drinks dropped by about 20 percent. And, after Mexico imposed a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages in 2014, researchers documented a decline in sales.
You know most candidates on election evening and, of course, this thing goes on so long. They still don't have any idea what the votes are. We still have congressional seats under review. They have no idea. They've totally lost control. They've used the pandemic as a way of defrauding the people in a proper election.
GONYEA: And he worries if someone like Joe Biden wins the nomination then all the enthusiasm Democrats have in 2020 could fade. There's something else he likes about this Sanders crowd.
You look at the statistics, she says, rattling them off: 50% of Black children would be lifted out of poverty, she says. That figure, she adds, is 40% for Hispanic children, 61.5% of Native American children, 38% of Asian American Pacific Islander children, and 40% of white children.
Put trust and faith in the government to protect its people, the president said. Government isn't a foreign force in a distant capital. It's us; it's all of us.
NPR interviewed Anzalone, Minhaj Hassan of Islamic Relief and Laura Cardinal, senior director of humanitarian response at Save the Children about the situation in both disaster areas. The interviews have been edited for length and clarity.
We Asked People What They Know About Taxes. See If You Know The Answers
[Data would help us] ask our government more questions. People are becoming more aware of the impact of corruption and how much it actually costs Africa. For example, illicit financial flows [illegal movements of money from one country to the other] costs Africa approximately $50 billion [double the amount of development aid that Africa receives].
KELLY: That is NPR's Scott Horsley.
At the White House on Tuesday, Trump accused Baltimore officials of being corrupt and stealing billions of dollars.
YDSTIE: Exactly. So Wells Fargo has an interest in saying the tax cut is the reason it's boosting wages for its employees, precisely what the president predicted would happen, in order to gain favor with Trump and avoid more penalties. That said, Wells Fargo is also competing for workers in a strong economy, so they might have boosted wages whether there was a tax cut or not.
They're not only better today, but it turns out they do better in school, they're more likely to graduate high school, more likely to attend college, less likely to be recipients of public assistance, says Hilary Hoynes, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of California, Berkeley. When they're older, their health is better. They're less likely to be engaged in criminal activity, and they live longer. And all of those things are great for the child, but they're also great for society.
The unique effort is the latest example of how some states are preparing more than others to drum up participation in the constitutionally mandated head count of every person living in the country, expected to be fully underway by mid-March.
Critics of the bill say such savings are a fiction, as they are dependent on future Congresses sticking to plans to impose major cuts in Medicare and unpopular new taxes on health plans. We are creating a massive new entitlement, Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart (R-FL) said during floor debate Sunday.
The latter category includes his push for a $15 minimum wage — a goal pushed by many Democrats but opposed by many Republicans — and increased tax subsidies for families with children.
We've gotten high-paying jobs at this mill, it's really helping and now you're gonna change the rules again and make us start over again? he asked. Because of decisions made at the national level by politicians who are not in touch with what's happening on the ground with the people who live here.
Following a performance of What the World Needs Now Is Love, the crowd erupted into shouts of Love trumps hate! Love trumps hate!
GARCIA-NAVARRO: You mentioned it's hard to encourage new teachers to move down to where you live. But Teach For America is a program that's been trying to fill that gap. Is that helping?
That's bad for Trump. Any time that a candidate has to spend playing defense — explaining policies or wording choices, for example — is time he or she is not spending playing offense.
Putin also complained in public about another individual, Bill Browder, who has spearheaded a global campaign of sanctions against Russia's elite but who Russians say is a tax criminal and a money launderer who was behind an alleged illegal plot to send financial support to Hillary Clinton's presidential bid in 2016.
CASTRO: I am a candidate for president of the United States of America.
Exactly what those measures might look like were not disclosed. Fauci said federal officials are working to get ahead of the virus as its spread continues, saying, If and when the infections will come, sorry to say, sad to say, they will.

INSKEEP: He is chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, and the White House is putting out its economic forecast.
But the White House had previously said Trump would urge the IRS to use maximum discretion in enforcing laws regarding religious organizations and offer regulatory relief to religious objectors to contraception coverage. Neither of those policy changes was directly brought into effect by the order.
President-elect Donald Trump and Carrier have reached an agreement to keep 1,000 jobs in the U.S., the air-conditioner company announced Tuesday evening.
RASCOE: I'm Ayesha Rascoe. I also cover the White House.
Like many economists, Cottarelli has a long list of reasons why Italy's economy is stuck, and they start with Italy's adoption of the common currency in 2002. We didn't handle the transition to the Euro well, he says, explaining that a common rate of exchange meant Italy couldn't lower prices to compete with Germany. Since we couldn't devalue, we lost competitiveness.
DAVIES: There's been a lot of attention about who can use what restrooms. Was that a specific provision of the state law?
The president is expected to touch on themes similar to his Davos speech and to the remarks he gave last November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit, where he said, The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to violations, cheating, or economic aggression. Those days are over.

DODSON: I think a day one priority for Vilsack would just be to simply remove the restriction on hiring to be in Kansas City and allow hiring to be in Kansas City or D.C. And that would allow us to quickly get back some of our former staffers.
McMaster said Trump is eager to talk about ways to boost security and prosperity in Africa.
It remains totally unexplained. They said, Well, ah, we can't figure that. Now, that's many, many times what it would take to overthrow the state. Just that one element. Four hundred thousand ballots appeared from nowhere right after the election.
Watchdog and environmental groups are calling for an investigation of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt after reports that Pruitt may have received a sweetheart housing deal from the wife of an energy lobbyist. Pruitt is just one of several members of the Trump administration who have found themselves under an ethics microscope. Just last week, Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin became the second member of Trump's Cabinet fired amid allegations of alleged misconduct. And NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now. Hi, Scott.

JENNER: Well, you know, a lot of this is mind-numbingly complex tax rules that only a tax lawyer would love. But, for example, one of the signature proposals in the bill is a lower rate for what are called pass-through entities, and that's never been done before. The theory is that when you have, you know, small businesses that operate in, like, partnerships or sole proprietorships, you want to give them a break. The problem, however, is that that rule can be manipulated and gamed by very smart people. And so what they've done is they put in a lot of complexity to prevent some of that gaming. And with that complexity are going to come rules that are going to get bent, that are going to get avoided, that are going to get jumped over. That's just an example.
Which is to say: the Green New Deal framework combines big climate-change-related ideas with a wish list of progressive economic proposals that, taken together, would touch nearly every American and overhaul the economy.
Trump said the White House is also working with the Small Business Administration and industries including airlines, cruise ship businesses and hotel owners, which are all grappling with economic hardship as demand from consumers slumps and travelers cancel plans.
The coalition of billionaires is not exactly what's going to carry us over the top, Warren said.
But that's not terribly reassuring, because there might be some unreasonable person who might, rejoins Meredith Rose, of Public Knowledge. She says our copyright law is a relic from a time when few of us had the means to reproduce copyrighted work. Obviously, that's changed.
The IRS, however, has rarely moved to take away a church's tax exemption. According to the alliance, as reported by the Washington Post, only one of more than 2,000 Christian clergy deliberately challenging the law since 2008 has been audited, and none has been punished.
I remember — I was talking to Elizabeth on the phone when she was visiting her family, her grandchildren, and we talked about all this important stuff and what we have to do and then she said, well, I got to go because I have to go buy my granddaughter some sparkly shoes.

But here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.
This is not like a natural disaster that's located in one particular area that passes quickly and we focus on rebuilding. This is a nationwide problem in which states and localities are just shutting down restaurant operations across the nation without a lot of warning and with tremendous impact for us and our workforce.
We're going to be announcing something, I would say over the next two or three weeks, said Trump, adding that it would be phenomenal.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said federal officials are working to stay ahead of the virus, but efforts have been complicated by the number of infected people entering the country after visiting other parts of the world.

Is America Engaged In A 'Vicious Circle' Of Jailing The Poor?
Some 2 million young Italians – many of them educated and skilled – have left Italy since 2008, says Nicola Nobile, an economist at the research and analytics consultancy Oxford Economics. That's a lot in a country with a population of about 60 million. Immigration, which could help counteract the low fertility rate, is relatively recent in Italy – under 3% of Italy's population were immigrants before 2000, a number that now lingers around 10% – and so far it's not well received.
Their plan calls for $220 billion for a new round of direct payments, with $1,000 sent to individuals making under $40,000 a year and $500 for dependent adults and children. Individuals making over $50,000 and couples making over $100,000 would be ineligible for direct payments.
But Newport notes something unusual this year: Less than half the people surveyed — 46 percent — complained their taxes are too high. That's the smallest fraction since 1961. And for only the second time in decades, a slightly larger group of people actually thought their taxes were about right.

Part of the problem is that it isn't clear what kinds of information the government is gathering. Certainly, intelligence agencies are using government databases with tax records and property titles as part of their search. Treasury Department databases, which track money flows, are undoubtedly in the mix, too. What hasn't been revealed is the kind of corporate databases that are included. The assumption is that credit card transactions and maybe purchasing habits are vacuumed up too, but so far the government hasn't said as much. The possibilities are endless, because each and every day, we are all leaving little data trails that are easy to pick up.
We Democrats are here today to tell our Republican friends, turn back. Drop this irresponsible plan.
Trump's first year has been marked by record low approval ratings, and a majority of Americans said in a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll that Trump has done more to divide the country than to unite it.
MICHAEL DRISKELL: He's just doing everything he promised to do. And we are making America great again.
I wondered if you were going to say $27. I've heard that number before.
Let's put it this way: In the health care bill, a number of senators just point blank said this kind of [bill] — where you're just to drive it through on a partisan basis, where you don't have any [Congressional Budget Office] score, where you have really fanciful notions with respect to the revenue and the like — a bunch of them said, 'Nothing doing,' and the bill went down, Wyden said, in reference to Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine, who were decisive no votes on health care.

KURTZLEBEN: I mean, I would say two things. One is the favorability and unfavorability numbers. The NBC Wall Street Journal poll that came out this weekend showed that these two would be the most unpopular nominees in the history of that poll. So Clinton and Trump really have some problems there.
Since then, a range of other companies have joined in opposing the legislation.
If you want to run for vice president or president of the United States, hey, what's wrong with providing your tax returns for the past five years? Munoz asked his colleagues ahead of the Senate's 36-19 vote in favor of his bill.

GRAVES: Yes, every state has a state chamber. And it's the council of the executives of those chambers, which means basically the lead lobbyists, the executive director, of each of those state chambers of commerce.
KASICH: Well, I think we need to have more low-dollar efforts here the country. You know, having a handful of billionaires that can basically, with special interest, they can kind of buy an election is something that bothers me. But look, I have other focuses right now.
I'm looking ahead to a city of safe streets and strong schools for every child, regardless of neighborhood or ZIP code, Lightfoot said. A city where people want to grow old and not flee. A city of sanctuary against fear where no one must hide in the shadows. A city that is affordable for families and seniors, and where every job pays a living wage. A city of fairness and hope and prosperity for the many, not just for the few, a city that holds equity and inclusion as our guiding principles.
There was this serious attack on our democracy. And there is every reason to believe, David, that we're going to see it again in 2020. We need to know what was uncovered so that we can protect America and protect our democracy.
So there is how politicians talk about infrastructure spending, but then there are the people who actually have to build it. Tom Smith represents a lot of those people. He's the executive director of the American Society of Civil Engineers, and he is in our studios in Washington. Thanks for coming in.
COHN: Yeah. I mean, I think the most obvious one is the amount of money that went into the funding, the overall funding of the health care legislation. When they were debating this, there was a commitment that outlays, you know, the sort of amount money you spend that the Congressional Budget Office measured. It couldn't be more than a trillion dollars over 10 years. And there's no magical economic value to a trillion dollars. That's just - that's where, basically, it was thought to be politically sellable. As the debate went on, there was just a lot of pressure to hold that number down, mostly from more conservative Democrats, partly because they'd also - they had said they were going to be fiscally responsible. They weren't going to spend money they didn't have.
Biden has set a goal of 100 million shots in arms in 100 days.

House Ethics Chairwoman Susan Brooks, R-Ind., said that the ethics panel will review the proposal and come back to the conference with any recommendations by late summer or early fall. Republicans said they would like to have Democratic buy-in to any proposed changes to the OCE.

Friday's meeting with Rwandan President Paul Kagame, who is chairman of the African Union, takes on extra significance after Trump reportedly used a vulgar slur to describe African countries during an Oval Office meeting on immigration.
Schechter's writing is matter-of-fact and unshowy; while he includes the gruesome details of the bombing's aftermath, he does so with sensitivity — the book is never lurid or exploitative.

Traditional charities and foundations — commercial foundations, community organizations, community foundations, religious foundations — these foundations in philanthropy that make America what it is have been undermined, said Abbas Barzegar, director of research and advocacy at CAIR. [They are being] used, or in my mind exploited, to funnel anonymous money from wealthy donors to the Islamophobia Network.
Biden's inauguration as the 46th president was different than any seen before in U.S. history. Four years ago, Trump was arguing over his crowd size compared with Barack Obama's record-setting turnout of supporters on the National Mall.

So, how might policymakers get people to follow this advice? In a new report, the WHO is urging governments around the world to tax soda and other sugary drinks.
Right now, the tax credit maxes out at $2,000 a year. But Elaine Maag says millions of children live in families that don't make enough money to get the full benefit — or simply don't get any benefit because they don't file their taxes, maybe because of unstable housing or knowledge barriers.
Once she had to pull down her schedule, it seems to me that there was an obligation to share quickly what the set of circumstances were. And I honestly think they unwittingly played into a larger story, Axelrod continued. I don't think health is as big a challenge for her as stealth. She is a relentless, indefatigable person, I can attest to that. But the concerns that people have run to the other thing, and they ended up creating a bigger story than the one they were trying to avoid.
We think we have to have a DACA solution, House Speaker Paul Ryan told NPR's Steve Inskeep on Nov. 30.
For deficit hawks like Corker, it is unconscionable to vote for tax cuts if they believe it means more deficits and more debt. This is the most passionate thing for me, period, that I work on. Not foreign policy, not banking. It's this deficit issue, said Corker, who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And through the years, especially after Election Day, I've just seen it's like party time up here. Nobody cares about deficits anymore.

If you listen carefully, you'll hear something unusual on the presidential campaign trail this year. Democratic candidates are talking a lot about the lack of affordable housing, an issue that rarely, if ever, comes up in an election. They're trying to tap into a growing national concern, as well as a potential voting bloc.
The board changed its order to a request after complaints from outside residents. But the island has only one small clinic, and an influx of thousands of seasonal residents worries him.
Consumer advocates applauded the directive. Since 2016, the number of Americans without health insurance has been on the rise, reaching 30 million in 2019. The economic upheaval caused by the novel coronavirus has made a bad situation worse, throwing millions off their insurance plans.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: How happy are Republican donors with where the party is at? I mean, you have a president that is popular with the base but widely unpopular in the country. And a lot of donors are unhappy with some of the things that the Republicans have not been able to pass, namely health care.

LIASSON: A combination of Democratic voters clustering inefficiently in urban areas plus all those safely drawn Republican districts means that Democrats have to win way more than 50 percent of the national vote for the House of Representatives in order to get 50 percent of the seats.

And so we recommended the other day that the president invoke something called a DPA, Defense Production Act, which would allow him to take over the factories - this has happened in wartime - to make the ventilators, but other things, too. Some of the hospitals in New York have told me they don't have swabs. So they get the tests, but they don't have the nasal swab to do it. The second thing we need is the unemployment dimension. The third - paid sick leave, paid family leave. Lots of people - what if kids, you know...

But over time, it has morphed and changed and now sucks in a lot of taxpayers who are merely very comfortable.
The Trump administration's plans to add a hotly contested citizenship question to the 2020 census have suffered another major blow in the courts.
The guarantees for coverage for people with pre-existing conditions are among those most valued by the public. Even if the lawsuit stands little chance of success, putting those provisions back in play can create uncertainty for insurers and patients this summer and fall. It could also possibly provide Democrats another talking point for the coming midterm elections in November.
Now, his excuse for all this failure is that Atlantic City just went downhill — that it's not his fault.

As the economy sputters, Furman is now thinking about his one-time check idea as potentially a many-times check idea. Likewise, in a news conference on Friday, Trump said he now wanted stimulus checks to be much more than $1,000 and for the government to keep sending checks as needed. Pelosi and House Democrats are now calling for $1,500 checks for Americans. That so many on both sides of the political divide are talking seriously about giving away so much money is a sign of how severely the disease is hurting the economy.

Former President Donald Trump's remarks on the Ellipse on Jan. 6, urging his supporters to march on the Capitol as Congress was certifying the results of November's presidential election, are a key part of the case against Trump being made by House impeachment managers and are also being used by the lawyers who are defending him.
Obama reached back to the themes of his 2008 campaign. He came onstage to chants of Yes, we can! Yes, we can! And, as he did often during that campaign, he extolled his belief in American exceptionalism, rejecting Trump's assertions that the United States has lost its way.
In such cases we go with what's accurate. And err on the side of neutrality.

He does things like say that Barack Obama was the founder of ISIS or he picks a fight with a Gold Star family, and then Republicans stage a kind of intervention, beg him to get back on track, which he does briefly.

ALLEN: In many ways, the pandemic has just accelerated a trend that's been going on for decades. That's the view of Richard Florida, professor at the University of Toronto, who writes and speaks about cities and their future. But he doesn't buy the view that the wealthy and powerful will abandon places like New York and San Francisco.
But none of this bodes well for Trump's political capital for the fall fights ahead. September is going to be a busy month, and the president is still without any signature legislative victories — with no promise of one in sight.

GROSS: When you were running for - in the presidential primary in 2000, there was - and I think it's fair to call it - a smear campaign against you which used your daughter. It was like a whisper campaign saying that your daughter was actually a daughter that you had fathered with a black prostitute.

The Republican tax bill, which Congress sent to President Trump on Wednesday, would give most Americans a tax cut next year, according to a new analysis. However, it would by far benefit the richest Americans the most. Meanwhile, many lower- and middle-class Americans would have higher taxes a decade from now ... unless a future Congress extends the cuts.

Health insurers, which are threatening to pull out of exchanges in some states, aren't the main concern in Massachusetts. Gutierrez says he is hearing very little from the state's mature and stable market. Most plans that sell insurance through the Health Connector are nonprofits based in the state. And they may have less reason to worry that healthy members will flee, leaving insurers to cover the high costs of ill members. Massachusetts residents would still be required to buy insurance, by state law, even if the ACA mandate is repealed.
NICK SHAHIN: I was really proud of it. I know every day they would come home, and it would be the question of, you know, how was school today? And I could say, good. How was it for you?

JOHNSON: But as time went on, the documents showed Manafort was having really severe financial problems. The bookkeeper testified she had to send him a list of bills that needed to be paid urgently. That included a medical insurance policy that was about to lapse. There was increasingly a real sense of desperation. Paul Manafort had tapped out a line of credit, was applying for new loans. And prosecutors introduced documents they say were falsified or doctored by Manafort and his associates, that - loan materials that didn't include key details about his properties or overvalued his income.
Let's talk about immigration. During the campaign talked about the wall at every rally building, a wall across the southern border. Often at times deporting up to 11 million undocumented workers, banning Muslims. Do we see movement on any of those positions?

The other thing - but just setting that aside for now, just setting that sort of argument aside for now and just focusing on the political argument, it is said that one of the reasons that there is not more progress on this is that this is really not the top priority of Latino voters. People say that other issues come first.

He doesn't act out of sort of moral principle, particularly. He's always calculating what the angles are for him and for his party. And so he's got his eye on 2022. He wants to get back into being the majority leader. That's what he lives for, really. And he's now come to think of Trump as standing in the way.

Regardless of how, or whether, the Republican Party resolves its internal splits, the process will take time, says pollster Luntz: You have a segment of American society that does not accept the election outcome and is going to continue to speak up, is going to continue to agitate.

I'm sure we will continue to see them try to change the health care system in the same way they now try to change Medicare. I mean, they don't say they hate Medicare anymore like they - some - a lot of them did originally. But they're trying to privatize it. They're trying to cut its funding. I imagine that is where we are probably going.

It was becoming clear just before the violent insurrection at the Capitol that the party had lost two Senate runoff elections in Georgia, making President Trump the first president since Herbert Hoover whose party lost the White House, the House and the Senate in one term.

So this would be, I think, safe to say a radical change in the way the United States has talked and thought about climate change. One of the people that he has also indicated could be powerful in terms of shaping energy policy is Harold Hamm who was a billionaire who founded the shale oil company Continental Resources. He's been a big contributor to the Koch brothers fundraising network, and there is so far no indication that Donald Trump did not mean what he said when he talked about climate change being a hoax that has damaged American competitiveness.

Gilead's pursuit of an orphan designation is unconscionable and could be deeply harmful, Peter Maybarduk, who directs Public Citizen's access to medicines program, wrote in a statement.

In November, he had said in a debate that he thought wages were too high.

Our lower business tax will also end job-killing corporate inversions, and cause trillions in new dollars and wealth to come pouring into our country – and by the way into cities like right here in Detroit. To help unleash this new job creation, we will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investments. No one will gain more from these proposals than low-and-middle income Americans.
As the two chairmen have reinforced, the administration and Congress must work together on trade policies that build off the momentum of the president's tax cuts, which is why any tariffs should be narrow, targeted, and focused on addressing unfairly traded products, without disrupting the flow of fairly traded products for American businesses and consumers, Lauren Aronson, a spokeswoman for the Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement.
GREENE: Could this backfire for both sides?
The Republican fault lines go in every direction: between the grassroots and the establishment, between big donors and aspiring presidential candidates, between House leaders and Senate leaders.
One such royal yacht, the 136-foot Fortuna — a gift from Mallorcan businessmen to the former king, Juan Carlos — was sold three years ago at the height of the economic crisis.
LOWREY: Absolutely. So there are a number of proposals that would functionally force states and local governments to ease the regulations around building new housing. There are other proposals to expand public housing - boost to low-income tax credit, increase funding for HUD. All of these ideas would probably help. And I would note that there's a lot of energy around this. Right now Donald Trump is running completely correctly on the strength of the economy. Where Democrats have a real toehold to criticize Republicans is that families still feel very financially fragile. About 2 in 5 adults would struggle to come up with $400 in an emergency. They would be forced to do something like selling an asset - so, you know, a bicycle, a car or something like that - to come up with the money or would have to put it on a credit card. And so this very good economy doesn't feel great to a lot of families. And that's a point that you've seen Democrats raise and will continue to raise.
Judicial Watch, the conservative group that has led efforts to release former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails, called the House rules change shady and corrupt and a drive by effort to eliminate the OCE, as well as a poor way for the Republican majority to begin 'draining the swamp.' 
In their summary of the bill, Senate Republicans laid out the major provisions. Here are some of those big changes that this new version of the bill would make to the original BCRA, and what they would mean:
There are a large number of workers that are going to be required to self-quarantine or be at home to take care of family members who are self-quarantined, he said. For small and medium-sized businesses, we think it's appropriate for the government to pick up those costs.
Now, I hope that after giving a fair hearing to both sides, you will join the millions of people across our country supporting this campaign – not just Democrats, but a growing number of Republicans and Independents as well.
Like many other soldiers, I honorably completed my contract in 2012 and two years later they sent me a letter stating I had to pay the money back. Each contract has a different excuse. They stated the reason I was not eligible for the contract was because I had over 20 years of service at the time. I had originally signed up more than 20 years prior, but had breaks in service and only had 15 credible years of service, not 20. Although at the time, they informed me I was eligible for a bonus, now they are saying I was not.

[Earlier in the speech, Trump used Labor Department measures of unemployment for Detroit, but here he is calling the unemployment rate a hoax, which is a contradiction. His son, Donald Jr., has also said the numbers are manipulated for political gain. PolitiFact gave that claim a pants on fire rating. — Danielle Kurtzleben] [Aside from that, it's true that the current unemployment figure — 4.9 percent — is an incomplete way of measuring joblessness. In fact, that figure is just one of six different unemployment rates that the Labor Department computes each month to show different aspects of joblessness. However, that doesn't make the headline unemployment rate a hoax. As for the 1 in 5 figure, Trump is working off of a BLS report that found that 19.7 percent of families had no employed family members in 2015. That's different from in the labor force, and it's also an incomplete measure — the Labor Department's definition of family would include retired couples, for example. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

Uber, DoorDash and other companies have discussed pooling money into a fund for the many gig workers who drive or deliver for more than one service. That kind of crossover could become even more common, as more people hunker down at home and order groceries and meals for delivery.
And so what she seemed to be trying to say is, we want to beat Trump. None of this matters - and I think she did say none of this matters if we don't beat him. And so I'm the person to do that. That's what she was trying to do. Of course, people will debate whether it was successful.
Eight Democratic U.S. senators also called on fellow lawmakers to tie financial help for airlines and cruise lines to new environmental requirements that would reduce their carbon footprints.
SOMMER: Yeah, it can take years. And that's going to be true for some really key policies here, like cars and trucks. Transportation is the country's largest source of emissions. And, you know, instead of gradually increasing their efficiency, the Trump administration relaxed those standards. But for the Biden administration, the federal agencies have to do a very thorough process of writing new rules, and that'll take years. And then if it's challenged in court, that'll take years.
GREENE: Any evidence in this long battle over the president's tax returns that it's hurting him politically to keep them away from people?
This legislation is about giving the backbone of this nation — the essential workers, the working people who built this country, the people who keep this country going — a fighting chance, Biden said in a statement Wednesday.
The narrative among Bundy supporters is that the government is not presenting the truth and it's very difficult to know that truth and therefore why should men be convicted on things we can't know, said Tay Wiles, associate editor at High Country News, a western environmental magazine.

Putin said Monday that he supported Trump in 2016 because of Trump's positions on improving the U.S.-Russia relationship. The U.S. intelligence community also said Putin had a personal animus against Hillary Clinton that prompted him to do all he could to hurt her presidential bid.
The tragedy the Corcoran family has endured is one no family should ever have to experience, Blackburn said. The attendance of Pierce's parents at the State of the Union serves as a reminder that we, as a Congress, have a duty to keep the American people safe.

Democrats say they're leaving the option open for reconciliation even as Biden meets with Republicans to discuss a bipartisan solution.
Up until now, the president and his administration have been pressing for a payroll tax cut. The problem with that is it does nothing to help people who are suddenly not on the payroll because their employer has closed its doors.
Fishman notes that most of the people in jail are pretrial, which means that they have not yet been convicted of anything. They are legally innocent, she says. One of the great travesties, frankly, of jail admissions right now is that we have people sitting in jail for long periods simply because they can't afford to pay [bail].
There is fascinating research out there that shows children in poverty, their brains are actually not developing at the same pace or in the same ways as children in well-resourced households, so that children become disadvantaged for life, says Elaine Maag, who studies tax policy at the Urban Institute.
I have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat. Of which there are many.
So what exactly was he saying?
KEITH: I want to turn to Beto O'Rourke and, more broadly, the issue that he has really taken up since the mass shooting in El Paso and Dayton and later in West Texas. He has made that the centerpiece of his campaign - trying to get gun legislation and making other changes. And in particular, he has gone out farther than many other Democrats in the field, calling for not just a ban on new sales of assault-type-style weapons, AR-15s, but a mandatory buyback - basically, taking the guns away.
Trump also defended intervening in the company's decision-making. They say its not presidential to call business leaders, Trump said. I think its very presidential. And he vowed to make more such calls to executives at companies threatening to leave the U.S., because they're not going to leave the country.

Without the alternative minimum tax, Donald Trump would have paid a lower tax rate in 2005 than the poorest half of Americans — just 3.48 percent — despite income of more than $150 million. Trump wants to abolish the AMT. Now we know why, said Americans for Tax Fairness Executive Director Frank Clemente.
Trump's address included an emotional reunion that was one of the rare moments when both parties applauded. He invited Amy Williams, an Army spouse from Fort Bragg, N.C., to pay tribute to the role that military families play. She was seated in the first lady's box with her two children — 6-year-old Elliana and 3-year-old Rowan.
It sounds like more bad news for a region that's often characterized as incredibly corrupt. But there was plenty of others who were named in the Papers, from British Prime Minister David Cameron's late father to Argentine soccer star Lionel Messi.

Some House Democrats are eager to use their new majority and the power that comes with it to demand that President Trump release his tax returns. That could be problematic for the president, as Richard Nixon discovered when his taxes were revealed, causing him to make one of his most famous statements.
Kaus says it's nice to have a shorthand term for a very specific kind of political pandering, the kind he felt Gephardt was up to back in the summer of 2002. It's good to have a term that can be used as an epithet, he says.

MCCAIN: Yes, yes, it was her group of nuns that ran a orphanage in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Yes, that's where my wife was visiting with a medical team. And Bridget was there. And she had a very severe cleft palate. And we were very pleased to have the opportunity and the blessing to bring her home and be part of our family.
However, not everyone is a fan. The Florida Education Association, a statewide teachers union, sued to challenge the program in cooperation with the NAACP, the League of Women Voters and other groups. The suit was dismissed in the lower courts, which said the union and the other parties did not have standing to challenge it. This month, the Florida Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

And they won. We try to find other patterns - well, that means that people aren't moving to the left. You know, it's better to be a woman, which is, you know, the first time in American politics has ever been better to be a woman in terms of your chances of winning - but glad to see that. And I think that it's something simpler than that. I don't think most voters look at candidates even in primaries to think - to look at in an ideological way. I think...
Like other Americans, inmates and their families are struggling financially. CARES Act stimulus payments for inmates, which were granted after a legal challenge, help offset the myriad expenses inmates are responsible for, like telephone calls or medical needs.

We're going to hear more now about the Johnson Amendment, the tax code provision that you just heard President Trump promising to destroy. The amendment was originally proposed by then-Senator Lyndon B. Johnson, and it became law back in 1954. Trump can't just undo it. Congress would have to repeal it. It says tax-exempt groups like churches and charities can't speak for or against particular political candidates.

ALLEN: There's a long list of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs and companies that have joined Blumberg in what some are calling California's tech exodus. Some, like billionaire Elon Musk and major Silicon Valley companies Oracle and Hewlett Packard, are moving to Texas. Others, like Blumberg and fellow venture capitalist Keith Rabois, have relocated to Miami. Much of it has to do with changes in the federal tax law that have encouraged the wealthy to leave New York and California for low-tax states like Florida and Texas. But Blumberg says there's another factor, citing a Wall Street adage - capital goes where it's welcome.
Banker Noyer says the appeal of Paris might best be summed up in a recent tweet by Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, who lauded the commitment of strong government and business leaders to economic reform and wrote: Struck by the positive energy here in Paris. ... And the food's good too!
Health savings accounts, which are linked to high-deductible health plans, continue to multiply.

The crown prince is sweetening the deal with the population by loosening the ban on cinemas and concerts and allowing women to drive and go to work. Now you see Saudi women working in malls and at hotel receptions — unheard of until a few months ago.
ELVING: He was saying that this administration appears to be intentionally divisive - that it used divisive tactics to win in 2016 within the Republican Party and then, of course, in the general election and that it pursues these tactics even now, despite the need to foster some unity in order to govern. Now, particularly talking about immigration, President Bush used the word cruel. And former President Obama also used that word. He also gave a speech this week that was pretty much his first outing in the political sphere, campaigning for a gubernatorial candidate.
(Once again, NGrams isn't a perfect tool, so this should be taken as just a loose indicator. For example, there are some results mixed in that discuss other countries, but a scan through the results also shows that a majority of the mentions since the 1960s seem to refer to American politics.)

Cagle's comments come as Delta, one of the Georgia's largest employers, appeared close to convincing lawmakers to restore a $50 million sales tax exemption on jet fuel. Headquartered in Atlanta, Delta would be the prime beneficiary of the tax cut. The proposed exemption had been part of Deal's larger tax overhaul, which has passed the House and awaits Senate input.
No, we have a corrupt media. They've gone silent. They've gone dead. I now realize how good it was if you go back 10 years, I realized how good, even though I didn't necessarily love them, I realized how good. It was like a cleansing motion, right?
We're going to continue our conversation about the Republican tax bill and focus on specific provisions in the bill affecting health care. As we just heard, the bill will repeal what's called the individual mandate, a key part of the Affordable Care Act that requires people to buy health insurance or face a tax penalty. To understand what effect this could have on the insurance market, we're joined now by Julie Rovner, Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health News. Good to have you with us, Julie.
Alaska is a natural resource state, he said in a phone interview. You take away its natural resources and it has basically nothing.
As with all presidents, Biden doesn't have a magic wand. He can't heal families torn apart by views of Trump in one swoop. And he certainly can't get his agenda implemented without the help of Congress.
Moore is worried the tariffs might cost him his job. The mill where he works, NLMK Pennsylvania, in the town of Farrell, not far from the border with Ohio, employs 750 workers and is a subsidiary of Novolipetsk Steel, or NLMK, Russia's top steelmaker.
One much-discussed proposal that didn't make the final cut was an increase in the minimum wage. Progressive Democrats vigorously pursued including a minimum wage hike in this legislation, which would have gradually increased the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025. But the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian ruled that including such a provision does not align with the complicated rules over budget bills, so it is not in the final legislation.

As congressional Republicans work to reconcile the difference between the House and the Senate tax bills, the public has gotten its first look at the substance of that bill. And there could be some problems to work out. Many major laws are tweaked after they're passed to work out technical kinks. But because of the haste around this bill in particular, some are worried that there will be more unforeseen issues than usual on a bill that will affect the pocketbooks of millions of Americans. I'm joined now by Greg Jenner. He's a partner at Stoel Rives law firm and a former top tax official under President George W. Bush. Thank you so much for joining me.

KING: I want to ask you a bit more about that Fed rate cut, because the big surprise was that it looked like markets were going to rebound if the rates were cut. Futures were pointing higher. And then that's not what happened. It was about 15 minutes after the announcement that the markets kind of plunged anyway. We have, now, more countries reporting more new cases. The WHO announced yesterday that eight additional countries reported cases of COVID-19. Did the Federal Reserve possibly act too soon yesterday?

And this is the thing - what one of the things that Bloomberg was trying to do was to say that this is what Donald Trump is going to do in the general election. He's not going to make a distinction between democratic socialism and communism. And polls have shown that when people are given a list of characteristics, if a candidate is gay, African American, female, you know, what would make you least likely to vote for them? Socialism is usually at the top of the list. And this is what Democratic elected officials in competitive states and districts worry about if Bernie Sanders is at the top of the ticket. They say, you know, it's going to be an anchor on their reelection bids. But Sanders is the front-runner. And last night, he was not seriously challenged.
MARTIN: We should just note, there is no evidence to support that. We don't have a clear understanding of how many cases here in the United States were caused by Europeans coming to this country. We also need to note that there was a lot of confusion about the president's remarks in general. I mean, he said that these restrictions would include goods - they do not. He also said all of Europe would face travel bans - that is not true. Can you explain, though, Scott, the real restrictions and what they could mean for the economy?
While much of the new batch of hacked emails are benign newsletters and shared articles, one note in particular has gotten attention for offering a glimpse into Hillary Clinton's paid Wall Street speeches.

Speaking at a rally later Monday afternoon in Florida, Hillary Clinton didn't pass up the opportunity to criticize Trump's economic speech. The Democratic presidential nominee pointed to a recent analysis, written by a former adviser of 2008 GOP presidential nominee John McCain, which showed her economic plan would create upwards of 10 million jobs, while Trump's could cost the country more than 3 million. She also accused Trump of scrambling to do damage control by listing a new group of economic advisers.

There may be even more problems for Twitter than what real live people are doing on the app. A recent study conducted by a research team at Oxford University found that during the period of time between the first presidential debate and the second, one-third of pro-Trump tweets and nearly one-fifth of pro-Clinton tweets came from automated accounts. Douglas Guilbeault, one of the researchers in the study, told NPR that hurts political discourse. They reinforce the sense of polarization in the atmosphere, he said. Because bots don't tend to be mild-mannered, judicial critics. They are programmed to align themselves with an agenda that is unambiguously representative of a particular party. ...

Twenty-eight percent of Latino voters voted for Trump, according to those polls. That's about how Romney performed among that group — he got 27 percent. And it's far better than Trump was polling with Latinos before Election Day. Polling firm Latino Decisions had him with 18 percent of Latinos' support in the week ahead of the election.
As a result, Georgia's absentee ballot rejection rate was more than 10 times lower than previous levels because the criteria was so off.

To help us understand how Senator Schumer might operate as majority leader, we reached out to Alex Bolton, senior reporter at The Hill. Alex has covered Schumer for years and wrote about his new position in a piece for The Hill last month. And he's with us now to tell us more. Alex Bolton, welcome. Thanks for joining us.
It is personal between Cook and Zuckerberg
KASICH: Yes, absolutely. We have to have a key fighting role both in the air and on the ground. But we have to invite others to participate with us, and they're going to have to participate with us if we're going to get this done. And I think there's a great opportunity because I think a lot of these countries feel under great pressure and they know ultimately, ISIS turns its efforts towards them.
Five percent won't pay the rent - the chant of teachers on strike today in Oakland, Calif. Around 3,000 union members are picketing for better pay, smaller classes and more nurses and school counselors. Now, this should sound familiar because earlier this week, West Virginia teachers went on strike, their second time in less than a year.
GRANHOLM: Right. There has to be a strategy. Renegotiating trade agreements - that's great. Do it. Negotiating the ability for governors, for example, to offer training packages that are specific to job providers - you could consider helping - like Germany does - helping to subsidize people to learn on the job working, doing apprenticeship programs that are really focused on the jobs of the future. All of those are things that you could do and that he could be working on.
SEBRELL: Absolutely, it helps. They're very active in our school, and that has really saved us. Obviously, they're not there for the long haul all the time, but we've had a lot that have stayed three or four, maybe even five years. And they build relationships with students, and that's really the most important thing.
Some analysts predict Apple's update could result in a 7% hit to Facebook's revenue.
Biden says he would prefer the legislation be bipartisan, but Republicans are nowhere near being on board with the president's $1.9 trillion proposal that includes money to speed vaccine distribution, aid small businesses, reopen schools, shore up state and local budgets, and get $1,400 direct payments out to individuals.
During a call with investors, Cardinal Health chief financial officer Jason Hollar estimated the provision would allow the firm to recoup roughly $420 million in taxes paid as far back as 2015.
I disagree with any policy that would turn America's back on people who are fleeing harm. I frankly believe that it is contrary to everything that we have symbolically and actually said we stand for. And so I would not enforce a law that would reject people and turn them away without giving them a fair and due process to determine if we should give them asylum and refuge.
MOORE: If I were advising him on this, I'd say, no way in the world should you ever release your tax returns. This is his business.
Today, for the sake of our democracy, for the sake of our Constitution, and for the sake of our children, we lay out the case for the entire world to hear. You want to hear it?
MAYER: His goal now, as far as I can tell - he's in a very tricky spot, but his goal is the Republicans taking the majority back in the Senate, getting back in power, becoming the preeminent Republican in the party himself, being majority leader. And Trump, you know, stands in the way in many ways because Trump is splitting the party.

In addition to creating a new tier 3 mandate, the Feb. 6 draft bill keeps the current requirements for tier 1 and tier 2 sources, as well as the special solar carve-out.
DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Right. She started this speech with kind of a condensed version of the things she's been saying on the trail about what she'll do. But she really, really quickly made the turn to Trump's Detroit speech and about how Trump's economic plan would add trillions to the national debt while its tax cuts do mostly benefit the wealthiest Americans. And she had this.

I mean, you are - you've - you are identified with the conservative movement for your entire adult life. You've written many books. And you were a talk show host. You've written many columns.

And I'm hearing from a lot of people who are getting this money - some couples as much as $2,400 - and don't really need it. And they're asking me, what should you do? I would say, pass it on to someone else because we're all in this together. And we truly are, in this financial crisis, each other's brother's and sister's keeper.
There are some complications though. Kansas City put up millions of dollars to subsidize the USDA's move, and the agencies signed a 15-year lease for office space. Also, lots of the new employees and some of the transfers like being in Kansas City, so forcing them to move back to Washington would cause another big disruption.

McConnell said he plans to work with the White House to reach consensus among Republicans before turning to Democrats to ink a final deal.
Semantic bleaching kind of refers to the process where words don't have the meaning they had before, she said. They kind of come to mean nothing or something that is purely pragmatic, like just functional, but not really like laden with meaning.
GREENE: I was interested that he said, you know, he's going to consult with lawmakers, as you said. But he mentioned House Republicans and Mitch McConnell. What about Democrats? I mean, doesn't he need both sides to make some big moves like this to help the economy?
Trump Heads To Florida, Won't Attend Biden Inauguration
The aide said the president criticized the previous approach his administration took toward infrastructure funding — public-private partnerships. He faulted his former economic adviser. That was a Gary [Cohn] bill, Trump said, calling it so stupid because, he said, you get sued.

I think there was a consensus if Republicans aren't prepared to come on board, that's fine, said Sanders, who trumpeted the increase during his 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns. We're not going to wait. We're going forward soon and aggressively.
SEBRELL: I have seen a lot move away. But one thing that's been really rewarding this year was seeing some of our first graduating class come back to teach in the community. I think it's powerful to see the students' response to people who come back and teach. But of course, a lot of students, once they go out, they've lived in the big wide world, they don't necessarily want to come back.

Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today. It's wonderful to be in Detroit. I've been here many times. We now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America.

Ryan and McConnell struck a more cautious tone to reporters on their timeline for moving legislation. We don't want to set arbitrary deadlines on things. We want to get things right, Ryan said.
These three laws allow farmers and traders to do business outside of government-run wholesale markets that have dominated agriculture since the Green Revolution. The laws also allow them to do business online at prices guaranteed by the government. They say farmers must be paid within three days of selling their crops and cannot have their land confiscated by any buyer or corporation – a protection to allay farmers' fears of losing what is often ancestral property. The laws also establish conciliation boards to mediate trade disputes.

The special counsel's office also opposes a proposed change in the location of the trial from Alexandria, Va., in the National Capital Region, southwest to Roanoke.
That's a fundamental decision, Panetta said. And I think Mulvaney has made the decision that he's going to basically serve as an enabler rather than a chief of staff.
Resolution: In a written statement, Northwell said that although all eligible patients are offered generous financial payment options ... it is not required that providers list the options on the bill. Northwell stated: If a patient calls the number provided and expresses financial hardship, the patient is assisted with a financial need application. However, Northwell lamented, unfortunately, many patients do not call.
They cited what they called Pack's proposed radical changes in the governance of the networks. Credibility with audiences takes years to build and can be destroyed in days, they wrote.

Cohen also testified that the reason Trump was worried about Daniels' allegations and those of another woman possibly coming to light was because of the damaging Access Hollywood video that surfaced at the beginning of October 2016, where Trump was caught on tape a decade prior discussing groping, grabbing and kissing women without their permission.
The mob was fed lies, McConnell said on the Senate floor Tuesday. They were provoked by the president and other powerful people, and they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like.
WESSEL: Well, and that's for sure. Look, I think that there's nothing wrong with Scaramucci's three-part list. The question is how much do you assign to Wall Street and how much do you assign to Main Street and Washington? And the question is if you come from Wall Street, will you tend to blame Main Street and Washington more? And that will lead you to be reluctant or hesitant about regulating or keeping the regulations that are already there to restrain Wall Street. I think that's a really big question. What Mnuchin has said is there's some good and there's some bad in the Dodd-Frank bill that was regulated Wall Street after the crisis. But he hasn't said what was good and what was bad.
According to a Pew survey last year, 14 percent of recent churchgoers heard a presidential candidate being directly supported or opposed from the pulpit. Black Protestants were most likely to have heard such a message — largely in favor of Hillary Clinton or opposition to Trump. At the Rose Garden, Trump celebrated the long history of political activism within black churches, particularly, for spurring our nation to greater justice and equality.
Trump paid just $5.3 million in regular federal tax, perhaps because he was continuing to benefit from large losses he suffered when his real estate empire collapsed in the 90s.

The presidency, as an institution, fares better. Just 39 percent of Americans have either a great deal or a lot of confidence in the executive branch, with 59 percent not having any or having just very little confidence in it. Eighty-four percent of Democrats have not very much or no confidence at all in it, though; the same is true for 61 percent of independents. But just over three-quarters of Republicans — seemingly tying this question to Trump — say they do have confidence in the presidency, including 44 percent who say they have a great deal of confidence in it.

Boehner had more to say after his frogs in a wheelbarrow line. He added, I want to do more, too. But Republicans are still a minority here in Washington. Democrats control the Senate, we've got a Democrat in the White House, and our members are pretty frustrated.

The second option for Democrats is to use reconciliation, a process that has been used for the Affordable Care Act and the GOP tax cuts Trump signed into law. The process can be lengthy — and complicated — but would allow Senate Democrats to pass legislation with a simple majority vote without eliminating the filibuster.
The Massachusetts senator also looked ahead, past Tuesday's contest in next-door New Hampshire, where polls show her likely to finish third again.
But whether Biden should seek 50 or 60 Senate votes for his priorities is now the source of the most public rift yet between a president who built his reputation on compromise and working with Republicans, and the progressive base he's spent the past year courting and drafting policy with.

MONTAGNE: You know, we have seen the president take these dramatic positions before, I have to say, only to change his mind later. On gun control these past few weeks, he moved from one side to another. He sounded like a Democrat on some initial proposals, then backed off 24 hours later. Same thing with immigration. Why would trade be any different?
Biden's plan also calls for $15 billion in grants to small businesses, as well seed money for as much as $175 billion in low-interest business loans.
YDSTIE: Well, business confidence in the U.S. has risen in the past year, partly anticipating the tax cut and also in response to regulatory restraint by the Trump administration. So that may have boosted the U.S. economy a bit, but the economy was already on a solid foundation. And a good deal of the recent pickup is due to the very positive global economic picture, which has little, if anything, to do with U.S. taxes.
For Cordeiro, the allowances will make it easier to catch up on some bills and fill the refrigerator.
What brought about another decade of growing income inequality in the United States? The 2010s began and ended with pushes against inequality. The Occupy Wall Street movement made headlines back in 2011. And right now, Democratic presidential candidates are pushing ideas like a wealth tax. Even President Trump has made references to some of his supporters as forgotten Americans.
That's an important claim given that the FBI, CIA, Defense Department and New York Police Department have all started using Palantir's software in recent months to analyze their intelligence data. Privacy advocates have long said that one way to protect civil liberties is to create a way of knowing precisely who is looking at the information. That, in and of itself, creates a disincentive for misuse.

That reason has expired. Republicans are in the majority, and yet they are still running into the same problems. The inability of leaders in both parties to broker deals and work constructively across party lines has meant the general public is looking at a Congress legislating in the same-old, same-partisan ways.
So let me tell you how we would do it.
But, with a gerrymandered congressional map that benefits the GOP, that double-digit advantage is less imposing than it may seem and may not be enough to help Democrats win back the House.
If they're missing out on those votes, you know — we have very close elections in the state of Florida, she said. This could mean a huge difference going into 2020.
It is damaging to a democracy if you say things are fake news that aren't, and portray facts as something else, so I do think that it's damaging to a democracy, I do, the GOP senator added.
I'm doing this for the lifestyle, says Tannenbaum, who consults for companies on ways to enhance teamwork. He says he likes being able to take time off when I want to, and not justify it to someone ... and have ownership over my life. But contracting has been feast or famine, he says. He receives benefits through his wife's employer but says there's emotional fluctuation that comes with the uncertainty the work brings. The couple's American dream isn't about ownership, he says, but about experiencing as much as they can.
Govs. John Hickenlooper of Colorado and John Kasich of Ohio are publicly advocating such a program.
Though Republicans have largely opposed the plan since Biden introduced it in January, the budget reconciliation process allowed Democrats to push the bill forward without support from across the aisle.
KODJAK: Among those items, Trump calls for people to deduct their health insurance premiums from their taxes and use tax-free health savings accounts to pay for out-of-pocket costs. He proposes changes to Medicaid, the government health insurance for the poor and disabled. He'd give a fixed amount of money to each state rather than using today's cost-sharing formulas. Trump's plan leaves a lot up to interpretation. Antos likes the tax provision because he's assuming Trump would ensure they be structured to benefit low-income people, but other conservatives see it differently. Jeffrey Anderson is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. He looks at the proposals for deducting premiums and health savings accounts and sees a huge giveaway.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: I mean, we've seen these massive fissures in society that we've always known were there but have been exposed now. The sort of have and have-nots, the gig workers, those who have no protections devastated by the fallout from this pandemic in this so-called modern economy.

President Trump is planning a bipartisan pitch to Congress with his first State of the Union address on Tuesday, but he will have his work cut out for him with a public that is more divided than ever.
One of the first conclusions the scientists reached — based solely on the income generated by the business transactions — was that some neighborhoods were much richer than others. From their data, they could see — up to factors of five — differences between the wealth of the neighborhoods.
Just down the boardwalk is the Trump Taj Mahal. Donald once called it the Eighth Wonder of the World. It filed for bankruptcy in 2009.

But until that day comes — if ever — there may be other ways that taxation could bring more funds to the poor. The Oxfam report estimates that ultrawealthy individuals are currently hiding $7.6 trillion in offshore accounts.

Flake first revealed his intention to begin the series of speeches to the New York Times Tuesday night after the paper reported that Trump is now questioning the veracity of the infamous 2005 Access Hollywood tape, where Trump was recorded bragging about groping and kissing women. During the campaign, he admitted that the tape was of him and dismissed it as locker room talk.

BETO O'ROURKE: And in Odessa, I met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15. And that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa and Midland there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time. Hell yes - we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.
Now, Donald Trump has a different view. He's made a career of stiffing small businesses from Atlantic City to Las Vegas. There are companies that were left hanging because he refused to pay their bills. A lot of those companies scraped together what they could to pay their employees and many of them put their businesses at risk and some of them ended up taking bankruptcy. It wasn't because Trump couldn't pay them, it was because he wouldn't pay them.
[There's also a bit more of the personal in this speech. Trump not only talks about his children, as he often does, but also his parents and siblings. This week we've seen an effort to humanize a man who is known for being bold and confrontational, and that continues here. — Sarah McCammon]

KASICH: No, getting smoked will be something we will determine on the 10th. And smoked just means getting clobbered, finishing at the bottom or, you know - but that's not going to happen here. We've got too good of a ground game, too much effort, too much work, and the polls are indicating we're rising, which is why they're clubbing me over the head to try to stop this momentum.
We're already seeing some signs of slowing momentum in the U.S. economy and slowing business investment overall, Greg Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told NPR's Jim Zarroli this week. Daco said Boeing's troubles probably shaved about 0.1 of a percentage point off U.S. growth during the second quarter.

SCHUMER: Yes. Yes. But this is a crisis. And if we don't act boldly, it will linger for a very long period of time, and that'll be much worse economically and end up costing us more.
Mulvaney lasted a little more than a year in the job. He became tangled in the Ukraine scandal that led to Trump's impeachment when he put a temporary hold on military and other aid for Ukraine earlier this year at Trump's request.
CORRINE BOBBY: It's amazing that my daughter has this lifesaving care now. But you're going to force me to pay a penalty for something that I can't afford for the rest of us. But that shouldn't be my problem. My problem should be which insurance company I should be getting. That would be my problem.
The guidelines do set out the president's priorities, so let's take a peek:
And Trump? He may talk a big game on trade, but his approach is based on fear, not strength. Fear that we can't compete with the rest of the world even when the rules are fair. Fear that our country has no choice but to hide behind walls.
NPR correspondent Tamara Keith contributed to this report.
By 2014, the United States was producing so much oil and gas that it led to a global oversupply. That's when complaints over these deductions really started to roll in, says Gary Preszler, vice president of the National Association of Royalty Owners board.

In Pennsylvania, wells produce mainly gas, so landowners like Barrett noticed right away when companies took out big, unexplained cuts. Some Pennsylvania landowners have been complaining for years about exorbitant deductions. Still, many never have a reason to complain. Clark, for example, says he feels his deductions are reasonable.
OSNOS: Well, if you take Asia for a second, in his - since Election Day, he has spoken to the South Korean president. And according to South Korean reports, he has indicated 100-percent support for that alliance. He has over the last few months disputed his own statements on the subject of whether or not he wants Korea and Japan to develop nuclear weapons. He said so clearly at one point, but he may have had a revision in his thinking.
If their insurance costs more than that, workers can shop for coverage on the marketplaces set up by the health law and be eligible for premium tax credits — if their income is less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level (about $47,000). But the standard does not take into consideration any additional costs for family coverage.
She worries the Republican model won't be affordable.
Additionally, the court ordered restitution payments of $400,000 to the University of Maryland Medical System, where the former mayor once served as a board member. The medical system — one of the state's largest employers and one of Pugh's biggest customers — had agreed to enter a no-bid deal to purchase 100,000 copies of the books. The existence of the deal was first reported by The Baltimore Sun in March.
GONYEA: Right. And, you know, there's a Trump web ad seizing on the short-circuit comment, showing her kind of like a robot in a low-budget science fiction movie, melting down. She doesn't say anything about it at the rallies but her running mate, Tim Kaine, was on Meet The Press yesterday. He acknowledged the email server was a mistake. He said Clinton learned from it, and he said they would be, quote, real transparent in the White House. But you're right, they are absolutely going to keep hearing about it right through November.
I don't think any of the compromises have in any way fundamentally altered the essence of what I put in the bill in the first place, he said.
But the event had to be hurriedly moved to an alleyway because a member of Morning Star Baptist Church, Gregory Evans, objected to the event being held on church's property.
In some states the bill was circulated but not passed or signed. California Gov. Jerry Brown refused to sign the measure on the grounds that the state couldn't afford to lose revenue. In her new book about period equity, Weiss-Wolf estimates the revenue from menstrual products can range from $1 million in Utah to $20 million in California.
Biden's plan comes just weeks after Congress passed a $900 billion relief plan that took weeks of painful negotiations. But economists have said the economy would need additional help as new coronavirus infections continue to surge, and as the daily death toll from COVID-19 exceeds 4,000.
This is the closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing Obamacare. The time is here; the time is now. This is the moment, said Ryan, summing up the situation as a binary choice for Republicans: Ditch Obamacare, or keep it.
INSLEE: Of course, of course. I mean, we're not going to shut down the U.S. economy tomorrow at noon. We're going to have a rational transition, and the pace is driven by science. Now we've got a president who says that wind turbines cause cancer. He's wrong. They cause jobs. And I've had a vision for this that now is coming to pass, and we know that because clean energy jobs today are growing twice as fast as the U.S. economy. And these are not jobs for physicists necessarily. They're jobs for carpenters and laborers and machinists.

The national debt ballooned by $8 trillion during the Trump presidency, and few Republicans spoke out or put restraints on him. Instead, using the same budget reconciliation process, Republicans passed $2.3 trillion in tax cuts, $400 billion larger than the package Biden wants to push out for COVID-19 relief.
Too many companies lobbied for trade deals so they could sell products abroad but instead moved abroad and sold back into the United States.
The American Petroleum Institute (API), the oil industry's largest trade group, has said it doesn't want government intervention in the oil market. But outside the stimulus bill process the API is asking for temporary relief from some regulations.

I'm doing what I can hopefully in a nice way to try and steer us back to the fact that deficits matter. They're a greater threat to us than North Korea or [the Islamic State], he said.
As fast as I can, I send what are called DMCA takedown notices to Amazon and they sometimes take [the products] down, and when they do, they come right back up within a week, Sedlik explains. And if I want to go to federal court, I need to engage a lawyer. And if I want to engage a lawyer, it's very expensive. 
Flake's office did not have a timetable for when he plans to begin the series of speeches but said it would not be this week.
The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says that lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent would cost more than $2 trillion over a decade, for example.
But Calk argues the personal-income tax cuts, as well as the Trump proposal to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, will help taxpayers by boosting economic growth.
MARTIN: I was going to ask you about that because you've got big pieces of legislation only being passed by one side. Is this the new normal?
Ceci says a quarter of the city's $3 million general fund comes directly from NLMK through property taxes and income taxes, and if it were to shut down, it would crush the city financially.
UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) No head tax.
Pasciuto says he's definitely OK with that. Absolutely. We're always happy to get any break we can get, he says.
The irony of bail is that its initial purpose was to make it possible for people to get out of jail, right? You couldn't be held in jail without a finding of guilt, or prior to a finding of guilt, without having an opportunity to get out. But the irony is that now bail really functions to hold people in. .... This means that if you have money to pay bail, you can get out no matter how dangerous you are, whereas if you are poor and all you've committed is a traffic violation, which is one of biggest drivers, frankly, of jail admissions in most places, you are going to sit in jail because $500 is a lot of money to you.
And at least 15,000 ballots were cast by individuals who moved out of the state prior to November 3 election. They say they moved right back. They moved right back. Oh, they moved out, they moved right back. OK. They missed Georgia that much. I do. I love Georgia, but it's a corrupt system.
Hodgson quit a job at a software company and now consults on software she helped develop. She helps hospitals across the U.S. install and manage an electronic medical records system. She travels to hospitals Sunday through Thursday and spends the weekends at home. I'm not looking to any changes to my situation, she says. I'm very happy.
It's fair to say the public now knows more about Hillary Clinton than nearly anyone in public life, Mook said in a statement. Hillary Clinton's release of updated medical information today meets a standard followed by presidential candidates like Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. Additionally, Hillary has made public nearly 40 years of tax returns over her lifetime. In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hands down the least transparent presidential nominee in memory. His Doctor Oz charade is as completely unserious as his original joke of a letter written in five minutes. He continues to hide his taxes and business dealing behind fake excuses. And it begs the question: what is he trying to hide?
Republican lawmakers, who opposed the bill, criticized the legislation as being rushed.
SHAPIRO: And when I just asked McCarthy about that, she sort of said, sure, legislation would be great, and moved on. I mean, with the Democrats' thin, thin margin, is there any chance a major climate bill would actually pass?
All 50 Senate Democrats would have to vote with 10 Republicans to pass a permanent bill. And that is far from guaranteed.
Neely explains that the industry has partnered with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation to work in communities with high rates of obesity to try to change the behaviors of people who may be getting too many calories from sugar-sweetened beverages.

If the health law is repealed, that could change. In some industries with lower-wage workers and smaller profit margins, they might begin to offer them again, and employees might demand it to help make the premiums more affordable, said Steve Wojcik, vice president of public policy at the National Business Group on Health, a membership organization representing large employers.
You know, we don't want all this other stuff that is unrelated to COVID. You're talking about over a half-a-trillion dollars of money going to state and local governments that don't need it. For example, the biggest windfall of money going to any state is the state of California. And guess what? California has a $10 billion surplus last year. They don't need it.
MONTAGNE: Well, that's one way of looking at it. And to discuss this and other issues this week in politics, we're joined by columnist and commentator Cokie Roberts and Washington Post columnist Kathleen Parker. Good morning to both of you.
We have to make some assumptions about potential conflicts, and I can't rule it out since he won't rule it out, he says.
Around the world, economies have been crushed by the pandemic. The International Monetary Fund reported in October that most Mideast economies plunged into recession. But some places are especially vulnerable, among them Iraq. Its economy depends overwhelmingly on oil exports, and as travel halted and demand for fuel dwindled, government revenues tumbled along with oil prices.
He points to economic theory that suggests the dollar would rise and offset the added cost for U.S. consumers. But another heavyweight critic, former Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes, scoffed at that idea in an interview this week on CNBC.
Gauthier Rollin, 52, has been employed by the company for 20 years. He says the work environment has been unbearable since France Telecom was privatized a decade ago.
The new mayor also will have to work with the City Council quickly to find money for a spike in state-mandated payments to Chicago's beleaguered pension funds. City Hall's ante into its pension funds jumps by $121 million next year, and the city will have to come up with about $1 billion more by 2023 in order to keep up with those ever-rising obligations.
Medical research is critical. We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources.
HARARI: It tells me that, again, the situation is extremely fluid. That conviction that people held for years and decades and seemed to be completely set in stone can actually be overturned very quickly in such a situation. And the thing is that in most countries, politicians have been taken completely by surprise. They didn't prepare for this kind of thing. They don't have blueprints in the drawers - what to do. So it's a rare opportunity when you can actually make them change their minds and try something that in normal conditions they wouldn't think about. But it can go both ways.
BENSON: Probably not. But I remember the formulation was, you know, I'm going to get back to you very soon. He said that about his tax returns as well and then just dragged it on and on and then it never really materialized. So your guess is as good as mine on that. My suspicion, Matt, is that you're right, that there are not tapes. But I don't put it past him. There might be tapes.

CARY: And - yeah. I was gonna say, and the people of Puerto Rico - versus what he sees as the elite, which would be the mayor and questioning the mayor's poor leadership ability - can't get workers to help, was told to be nasty to Donald Trump is in the tweet also. And this fits with his M.O. of going against the elites. And this fits with the rest of the news this week as well. I'm not surprised.
Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape the tremendous cycle poverty that they're going through right now and make it almost impossible for them to join the middle class.
Democratic leaders and the president are now in a heated battle over subpoenas as lawmakers investigate Trump's business dealings, and some in the party are talking about possible impeachment. Yet a Democratic source familiar with discussion called the meeting uncharacteristically muted.
MARR: Yeah, it's simple for them. They just get the simple maximum $2,000 tax credit. For lower-income people, it's more complicated because there's a formula that phases in with their income. So they - essentially, once a low-income person passes a threshold of income of $2,500, the child tax credit phases in at 15 cents on the dollar. And so the result of that is you have 27 million children in our country who do not get the full maximum amount because their parents do not make enough money. So roughly, for example, half of the Black children in the U.S. do not receive the maximum child tax credit because their parents don't make enough money.
Lawmakers in Harrisburg have never overridden a veto from Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf.
Under my plan, no American company will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. In other words, we're reducing your taxes from 35% to 15%.
My running mate, Mike Pence, and by the way, a great guy, signed a similar order when he became and when he worked so hard in Indiana as its governor. This will give our American companies the certainty they need to reinvest in our community, get cash off of the sidelines, start hiring new jobs, and expanding their businesses. So important. That's what it's about. I will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders.
Obama painted a picture of an America rooted in the same values his grandparents instilled in him: honesty, hard work, kindness and humility.
The guidance is from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which oversees the insurance marketplaces set up by the Affordable Care Act. CMS is encouraging states to allow the sale of plans outside of those exchanges that don't incorporate a surcharge insurers started tacking on last year.
Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be.
The thing is that very few employers ever did anything else. And we did another survey: We found that over three quarters of working parents have received nothing else in the way of time off or money for child care. It's just these flexible hours. And as a working parent, I can tell you there are only so many months that you can wake up at dawn or work after bedtime in order to get it all done. It's just not sustainable. And so what's happened is that either people have had to figure out their own alternate arrangements or they're just really incredibly burnt out, [with their] mental health really suffering, or else they've had to cut back on work, either quit, cut back their hours, not apply for the promotion they wanted. And these things are just going to have really deep, long-term effects on their careers.
And this occurred at the same time that unrelenting financial strains have hollowed out newsrooms across the country. Executives at News Corp., the New York Times Co., Gannett and tronc (formerly Tribune Publishing) have all reported deep declines in advertising revenues. Over time, reporters have only become more concentrated in Washington, D.C., and New York, as Nieman Lab's Joshua Benton wrote Wednesday.
Democratic congressional leaders say President Trump has agreed to a $2 trillion infrastructure plan. But — and it's a big but — there was no agreement on how to pay for such a wide-ranging and expensive proposal.

Sanap is one of the approximately 800 million Indians whose primary source of livelihood is agriculture. Tens of thousands of them have amassed in New Delhi for more than three months, protesting moves by the Indian government to deregulate wholesale trading.

Pineau-Chaisson is a so-called long-hauler. These are people who survive COVID-19 but have symptoms — sometimes debilitating symptoms — many months later. As scientists scramble to explain what is going on and figure out how to help, disability advocates are also scrambling: They are trying to figure out whether long-haulers will qualify for disability benefits.

AUBREY: So speaking of Donald Trump, where does the race stand now?
Democrats would need only a simple majority in the House to impeach Trump — something that's happened to only two other presidents in the country's history. To remove him from the Oval Office, which has never been done before, would take a two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict him of any articles of impeachment, which could theoretically arise from Mueller's investigation.
There's nothing suspicious in my tax returns, believe me, Kaine said as he imitated Trump.
Senate Republicans included a reinsurance program in the Better Care Reconciliation Act, the health care overhaul that failed earlier this summer.
Forty jobs is a big deal in a town of 3,000 that lies within one of the poorest counties in Idaho. In fact, the business park is just one of many projects that local officials have gotten done by leveraging federal rural development aid. Others included grants to retrain laid off millworkers and USDA rural development loans that helped finance Orofino's new wastewater treatment plant.
Just 37 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing just over five months into his tenure, while 51 percent disapprove. Forty percent of those polled strongly disapprove of Trump's performance, twice the 20 percent who strongly approved.
OCASIO-CORTEZ: It does. It does. Yeah. I have no problem saying that. Why? Because we have tried their approach for 40 years. For 40 years, we tried to let the private sector take care of it. They said, we got this, we can do this, the forces of the market are going to force us to innovate. Except for the fact that there's a little thing in economics called externalities, and what that means is that a corporation can dump pollution in the river and they don't have to pay for it, and taxpayers have to pay for cleaning up our air, cleaning up our water and saving the planet.
In one recent tweet, the president-elect threatened to, in his words, terminate the deal if Cuba is unwilling to make a better one for Cubans and for Americans. Michele Kelemen, NPR News, Washington.
HARARI: Yeah, very worrying, especially because the agency doing it is the secret service and not the health care system. I mean, I'm not against surveillance, per se, but it's very important who is doing the surveillance, who's getting the data and whether the surveillance goes both ways. I mean, surveillance can always go both ways, not just government monitoring citizens but also citizens monitoring governments. I'm very worried about the situation when the government starts collecting enormous amounts of private information while its own decision-making process remains opaque. I mean, it's very important that the governments also in such a time would be closely monitored by parliament, by citizens, by the media. And it's not like they can just issue whatever emergency decrees they want.
Being in default means the government can take part of your tax refund or paycheck. When you get older, you can even lose part of your Social Security checks.
The sale generated a tiny fraction of the revenue it was projected to raise.
And that's not just a big deal; that's a gargantuan deal. The prospect of investors in U.S. debt accepting less on the dollar than they are owed could tank the economy (more on that later).

CORLEY: That's Sharone Mitchell, the head of the Illinois Justice Project and part of a coalition which helped draft the Illinois bill. He says pre-COVID-19, there were thousands still detained in the state because they couldn't afford bail. But whether people languish in jail is not the Law Enforcement Coalition's only argument. The group says communities will be less safe; that criminals released on bail will be running free, possibly committing new crimes; and that counties across the state don't have the finances for electronic monitors, staff and other items that might be needed as people are released from jail before trial. Mitchell says he respects law enforcement, but their analysis is wrong.
Likewise, making a credit permanent could make some sense in terms of helping cancel out some other tax bill changes, like the (permanent) elimination of personal exemptions — a set amount taxpayers get to subtract from their taxable income for themselves and for dependents. And a temporary $300 credit for parents and nonchild dependents could be considered a shot in the arm of an anemic economy.

But that's not a given. A health insurance broker can help people find and evaluate plans sold off the exchange. But experts urge consumers to stay on their toes and make sure they understand whether the plans they're considering provide comprehensive coverage.
HILLARY CLINTON: Doesn't look like he paid a dime of federal income tax for almost two decades.

ELVING: Nixon had been named a co-conspirator in the Watergate political spying scandal. But with a pardon, he could never be charged or held to account for obstruction of justice or any other crimes. That decision hung over Ford's presidency and probably cost him the next election. The basic pardon power is in the Constitution and goes back to the Founding Fathers, who saw it as useful - redeeming the wrongly convicted and for political gamesmanship, much as the pardon power had been for kings in England and elsewhere.

In a CNBC interview on Wednesday, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., called the bill a wish list from the progressives, a label that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., echoed on the Senate floor Saturday.
Typically, people can buy a marketplace plan only during the annual open enrollment period in the fall or if a major life event gives them another opportunity to sign up, in what's called a special enrollment period. Losing job-based health coverage is one event that creates a special sign-up opportunity; so is getting married or having a baby. But usually people must sign up with the marketplace within 60 days of the event.

Laura Lucero Y Ruiz De Gutierrez has a heart condition and fibromyalgia and is at high risk of developing diabetes. She has health insurance through her husband's job.

Victoria Pearl Wright said she and her husband expected to get a tax refund similar to the $5,085 check they received last year. Wright, 24, is nine months pregnant, and she said she planned to use that check to cover expenses when she takes unpaid maternity leave as venue manager at a cafe-bar in Houston. But this year Wright did not get a refund. Instead, she said she and her husband owe $79.
OSNOS: Yeah, he could. The Paris climate deal is a formal matter, requires four years to unwind. So in the interim, he could immediately suspend American payments to the deal in effect. These are the payments that the United States would make to U.N.-affiliated agencies that would be in charge of both implementing the deal and then also helping developing countries pay for making some of the concessions and transitions that are required in order to implement it.
The goal, the Massachusetts Democrat says, is to help families stay solvent as the economy continues to suffer. To do this, he says, some elements of the bill, such as an expanded and reimagined Child Tax Credit, would work in concert with programs like food stamps, rent and utility assistance, and health care programs such as Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program.

Taxpayer information is legally supposed to remain confidential, but a 1924 provision gives Congress some access.

DEBONIS: Absolutely. And, you know, what they did - you know, they repealed the mandate that people have to buy insurance, the most unpopular part of Obamacare. But, you know, there is a cost in terms of insurance coverage associated with that. And, you know - but on the other hand, it generates a lot of revenue that they can use to do other things in this tax plan that they want to do in this tax plan - including getting that corporate rate down, including getting individuals some of the benefits of this plan. And that's the trade-off they got to work through.

In the book, released this past summer, Flake explained he was deeply concerned about the perpetuation of conspiracy theories and alternative facts peddled by Trump and his allies, such as conservative media like Fox News. Flake recalled how he faced blowback in Arizona when he told a Tea Party group he believed Obama was, in fact, a U.S. citizen and was subsequently booed because I didn't subscribe to a right-wing conspiracist fantasy about our first African American president. He called it a sobering experience indeed.

When the Legislature first introduced their legislation, we did not cry foul, we did not point fingers, we did not do anything to create a vibe, he said. Rather, what we did is we rolled up our sleeves and we went into the offices of Republican legislators that stood with us as we engaged with the Legislature to make sure that the initial legislation that was introduced was fixed and got closer to the will of the people.
The package is also expected to set aside more than $128 billion in grants to help K-12 schools reopen and $39 billion for higher education institutions.
Cotton & Reed is one of many distilleries using their alcohol to make hand sanitizer to help ease serious shortages during the coronavirus outbreak.
UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: (Yelling) No head tax.
That's why we need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn't a matter of political correctness. It's a matter of understanding what makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith. His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot I stand tonight that to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place. When politicians insult Muslims, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid bullied, that doesn't make us safer. That's not telling it like it is. It's just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. And it betrays who we are as a country.
GOP '200 Day' Agenda Calls For Spending, Tax Cuts. But What About The Deficit?
In the past couple of decades, half the growth in the labor force has come from immigration. But, Gordon points out, Trump has said he will deport millions of immigrants.
So I think that the coming primaries and caucuses actually favor us. So the Deep South was very good for Secretary Clinton. But I should also point out to you that a lot of those states in the Deep South, unfortunately, I wish I could tell you otherwise, are probably not going to be won in the general election by Secretary Clinton and myself. But when we win, as we did in Colorado and in Minnesota and in Michigan, these are — in New Hampshire — these are battleground states which Democrats have to win. We have already won them.
It's really important that the Social Security Administration get ahead of this and start studying it now, says Kathleen Romig, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who formerly worked at the SSA.
But some of the most intriguing excerpts come when Clinton is addressing issues of Wall Street while actually on Wall Street. In the hacked email, the Democratic presidential nominee discusses the rigged system, and the causes of and solutions to the financial crisis in an unguarded tone, framing large banks and investment firms as partners rather than problems.
He looked spot on for a bit. But then came World War II, which saw an explosion of government spending. And when the war ended, America saw a baby boom, technological innovations and a huge growth in demand for new products, from wood-paneled station wagons to TV dinners to Slinkys. This booming economy fed higher investment and productivity and wage growth, and America transported back to the pretty world of standard economic theory. The postwar years proved to be far from stagnant, and the idea of secular stagnation was thrown in a newly patented trash compactor.
GREENE: NPR's Sue Davis. Thanks, Sue.
Democrats say the goal was to avoid a payment cliff in August in which millions of people would suddenly lose unemployment coverage. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he is continuing to work with Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on further tax forgiveness.
Similar legislation was introduced last year in Wisconsin, where it is awaiting a hearing. And so far in 2018, three more states have introduced anti-tampon tax legislation: Nebraska, Virginia and Arizona. In the latest attempt to pass the measure in Utah, the bill died in committee earlier this year.
NIXON: New York is a 2-1 Democratic state. And since Andrew Cuomo has taken office, he's eliminated the bank tax, he's slashed taxes on corporations, he's slashed taxes on everybody earning more than $300,000 a year, and he has decimated our infrastructure and he has cut our cities and our towns and our rural areas of the most basic services. We are a wealthy state, and we are operating now from a position of falsely imposed austerity.

Democrats Say Relief Programs Could Become This Generation's New Deal
--Modest middle-class cuts: There would also be tax cuts across the board, including a modest one for those considered middle class.
SHAPIRO: We actually did the math looking ahead. And if you have an extraordinarily good night on Tuesday, winning Florida, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio, every state but North Carolina, and you go on to win Wisconsin, Oregon and California by large margins, you would still need 51 percent of all the delegates from all the remaining contests, not factoring in superdelegates. That seems like an extremely steep hill to climb.
Schumer said the proposed package would include funds to repair roads and bridges, along with water projects and a big emphasis on broadband and the power grid, so we can bring clean energy from one end of the country to the other.
There is a mix and actually there's quite a bit of momentum on the Republican side. Prominent Republicans in the Senate have actually identified the child tax credit as an area of possible cooperation with President Biden. Sen. [Mitt] Romney was the first Republican to advance a proposal to make a large share of the child tax credit fully refundable — exactly in line with the proposal that President Biden has advanced. [On Thursday, Romney proposed a measure to provide a cash benefit of $350 per month for children up to 5 years old ($4,200 per year) and $250 per month for 6- to 17-year-olds ($3,000 per year).]
Besides education, she says, my platform is, how is this issue going to affect the kids of Oklahoma? Poverty, health care, taxes. She says she's never seen her colleagues more engaged. The longer we see all these other states start to have the same similar movement, we realize we are waking up a sleeping giant and filling it with a terrible resolve.
Under then-President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Congress passed the National Defense Education Act, which poured federal dollars into U.S. colleges and universities — and into students' pockets — all in the name of playing academic catch-up with the Soviets.
Trump has also created new shock waves by saying — in this case quite clearly — that the U.S. can't default, because it prints money. That's true, but that doesn't mean it's good policy (as in, it could easily cause massive inflation).
GREEN: Yeah, I was a mechanical and electrical engineer.
The Senate measure would slash the federal excise tax to $3.50 from $7 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels for brewers that produce fewer than 2 million barrels a year. It also would reduce the federal excise tax from $18 to $16 per barrel on the first 6 million barrels for all other brewers.
Carson did not unveil any new housing policy at the event, but he did tout the benefits of a Trump-backed opportunity zones program that offers tax incentives to attract investment to distressed neighborhoods.
Our proposal also includes economic relief for those Americans with the greatest need, providing more targeted assistance than in the Administration's plan, the letter reads. We propose an additional round of economic impact payments for those families who need assistance the most, including their dependent children and adults.
One of the key aims of President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill is to send money to people who were already at risk of falling behind on bills or slipping into poverty.
Animal cams rose to popularity over the past decade and have become a part of social culture. When Bei Bei, a giant panda at the Smithsonian National Zoo, was born, people flocked to the zoo to catch a glimpse of the cub that had captured their hearts online.
SMITH: Republicans want an infrastructure bill that's truly bipartisan. I mean, we know that our roads and bridges and ports and locks and dams needs the assistance. And I think we can get to a bipartisan approach as long as it doesn't turn into, like, a Green New Deal proposal that increases taxes on all Americans. So...
One more child to sacrifice on the order and on the altar of open borders.
And when we invest in infrastructure, we are not just going to invest in roads and bridges and tunnels and ports and transit and water systems; we are going to connect every home to high-speed broadband so they can get into the global marketplace.
KEITH: Yeah. And that was my other takeaway, which is not a big takeaway, but that, you know, in past debates, there was at times some distancing from former President Obama. In this debate, there was so much embracing of President Obama.
The House will need to approve the final version of the bill before it can head to Biden's desk to be signed into law. The House will meet to vote on an identical measure on Tuesday, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said Saturday.
SHAPIRO: You think these laws will be struck down by the current Supreme Court.
Avenatti won't say how he wound up representing Daniels, but said she wasn't referred to him by anyone with a political ax to grind.
I give them very high salary ... but the problem is they don't like [the work], he says. He gets the impression Saudis would rather be working in a government office. Each one he like to have a table, he's a boss. Even if just to graduate he just want to be a boss, direct, he says.
Trump signed two executive orders directing the review of the Dodd-Frank financial regulations and halting implementation of another federal rule that mandates financial advisers to act in the best interests of their clients.
If the current situation continues, warns Sajad Jiyad of the Century Foundation, and if oil prices are low, there is a real possibility that more and more people will go on strikes or protests, and things could become more difficult.
MONTAGNE: Well, let me ask you this. How big of a problem has Donald Trump got with leaders of his own party, but also the other side, who are calling his rhetoric these days racist?

His defense lawyers, however, point to a different passage, in which Trump said, I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard. They argue that his words were not a call for actual violence and lawlessness.
Religious exemptions are exemptions because they are for small groups of people, and it doesn't necessarily undermine the full purpose of the law to have them, says Shapri LoMaglio, vice president for government affairs at the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities. I think case law is upholding the idea that that exemption is the right thing in order to be faithful to the Constitution.
Orbán declined to be interviewed, but his spokesman, Zoltán Kovács, defended the government attacks on Soros and groups supported by Open Society Foundations. The latest assault involved bills introduced on Feb. 13 in Hungary's parliament that, if passed, could lead to many foreign-funded NGOs shutting down.
SIMON: What are the changes proposed to the tax code you see that could most affect individuals and families?
Rental assistance: $25 billion for emergency rental assistance, including $5 billion for emergency housing vouchers for people experiencing homelessness, along with survivors of domestic violence and victims of human trafficking.
Experts predicted during the campaign that Trump's various iterations of his tax plan would blow a hole of trillions of dollars in the budget, even bigger than the Bush tax cuts.
Despite a lifelong struggle with panic attacks, Divya Singh made a brave move across the world last fall from her home in Mumbai, India. She enrolled at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., to study physics and explore an interest in stand-up comedy in Manhattan.
Risking a trade war with more tariffs will only invite more retaliation that will cause significant harm to the U.S. economy, the roundtable said in a statement. Instead of unilateral tariffs, the group called on Trump to work with allies to put coordinated pressure on China.

It does seem as if both the White House and Congress have now come to agreement that some kind of economic response is needed to the threat posed by the coronavirus. But they don't necessarily see eye to eye on what that action by the government ought to be.
JOHN THUNE: Yeah. I mean, I don't know how to explain it (laughter) because I've been in meetings with him on trade. And everybody's been very clear that we think some of the decisions that they're talking about making and policies they're talking about implementing would be very harmful to the economy at a time when it's really taking off. So I don't know.
What we've been able to do with the money we have is a lot of tables, Rickert explained. So we have a lot of kids sitting across a table from each other, which isn't terribly safe.
Schmittenberg Metal Works, an auto parts maker based in Wuppertal, is a prime example. Its factory there stamps out parts by the millions for the world's automotive industry.
SIMON: The majority of Americans don't own stock, even when you add in 401(k)s. So how concerned should Americans be with the stock market and the volatility we've seen?
BERNIE SANDERS: It was a bestseller. It sold all over the world, and we made money. So if anyone thinks that I should apologize for writing a bestselling book, I'm sorry. I'm not going to do it.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was unable to reach a deal late Thursday on a package of measures to address the coronavirus pandemic amid pushback from the top House Republican that the bill comes up short.
It was an exchange nearing petty; these two candidates were trolling each other. But for the most part it seemed totally normal in a campaign season like this one, and in the digital age in which we live. Establishment political figures like Bush and Clinton (or at least their young staffers) had co-opted the language of social media and mastered the formats, with all the snark and back and forth that come along with it, and with an extra incentive to adopt some of the meanness Trump has exhibited online.
Seventy-five percent of the people in that one week of admissions were being booked into the jail for misdemeanors or lower. ... And only 5 percent of them were for any crimes against the person; in other words, not necessarily violent crimes, but maybe something involved hitting another person, etc.
MARTIN: That's NPR economic correspondent John Ydstie. John, thank you.
ROBERTS: That is something that we've seen over and over again. You saw it in 1996 when it was clear that Dole wasn't going to be elected president. You saw it in 1972 with the Democrats when it was clear that McGovern wasn't going to be elected president. But they're not quite at they called the Dole strategy yet. They're still hoping that there's a prospect of winning the presidency, but they are very much concerned about the Senate campaigns.

His rhetoric was very negative during the election, but now he has to contemplate and analyze reality, Aguiluz says.
That's why I've set out a bold vision to make quality, affordable childcare available to all Americans and limit costs to 10 percent of family income.
A federal court's authority to recognize a damages remedy must rest at bottom on a statute enacted by Congress, he wrote, and no statute expressly creates [such] a remedy.
It was a huge week with huge proposals, and that got us thinking... are those the right proposals? So, we called up three of the smartest people we know — three economists who have studied, or even been present for, some of the greatest moments of economic crisis — to help us understand what our country should do.
DAVIES: I mean, the tricky thing about saying that you're going to keep the provision which prohibits denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions and permits kids in their 20s to stay on their parents' policies is that if you do that but don't mandate everybody to get insurance, you know, it changes the economics because you don't have young healthy people paying in.
ADOLPH: Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan has threatened to veto the head tax if City Council approves it. For NPR News, I'm Carolyn Adolph in Seattle.
The Democratic leader in the Senate was indeed beaming Wednesday, after President Trump took a deal he and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi offered to fund the government through mid-December. It's a trifecta of an agreement delaying big September showdowns on a government shutdown and on raising the debt ceiling, while also providing the first big installment of federal help for the Hurricane Harvey relief effort. The package passed 80-17 in the Senate on Thursday and is expected to pass the House on Friday.
We hold dear our right to have personal lives — to root for our favorite teams, to live according to our faith, to form deep personal relationships. Yet as journalists, like those in many other professions, we abide by some clear limitations on our private conduct. We don't put political bumper stickers on our cars, for example. We don't sign political petitions. We don't donate money to candidates. Those are some of the easy examples.
WU: She has. I was before her when I represented Rick Gates. We were in front of her during that time. She runs a very tight courtroom, and I think that if I were defending Manafort right now, I would be pretty worried about what's coming up this week. She's obviously not as friendly towards him. They have a history. She is the one that took away his bail and put him in jail where he still is.
KAMALA HARRIS: I want to give credit first to Barack Obama for...
We just heard from Marty Rosenberg. His company was called Atlantic Plate Glass. They were hired to do a big job for the Trump Taj Mahal. They worked really hard on it. But at some point, Donald Trump just stopped paying. In the end, he owed Marty's company nearly half a million dollars for the work they did under the agreement they made. Marty's business barely survived.
SHAPIRO: Art Pope, CEO of Variety Wholesalers, businessman and GOP donor, thank you so much for talking with us.

Americans Tightened Their Belts, And It Might Hurt Economic Numbers Important To Trump
And then I had to beat Stacey Abrams with this guy, Brian Kemp. I had to beat Stacey Abrams. And I had to beat Oprah, used to be a friend of mine. You know, I was on her last show, her last week, she picked the five outstanding people. I don't think she thinks that any more. Once I ran for president, I didn't notice there were too many calls coming in from Oprah. Believe it or not, she used to like me. But I was one of the five outstanding people.
America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs and our nation's wealth, Trump said. The era of economic surrender is totally over. From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair, and very importantly, reciprocal.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Rich had been living in Switzerland. He fled there in 1983 to avoid charges of breaking U.S. sanctions by selling Iranian oil to, among others, the apartheid regime in South Africa.
House Republicans say that would be preferable to the Cadillac Tax in the ACA, which is scheduled to go into effect in 2020 and taxes only the most generous plans.

MARTIN: One of the companies, Cardinal Health, says it plans to use a new tax break created last year under the CARES Act. This was a law signed by former President Trump meant to help companies that were struggling because of the pandemic. Is Cardinal Health a struggling company?
On traffic violations being a major driver of jail admissions
KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: Well, it's an important first step.
This year, expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when Western countries colonized poor countries, stripping them of resources and autonomy. People who work in the field know that much of the money, influence and decision-making about how to help low-income countries still comes from wealthy countries — with little input from the people who receive the assistance.
KEITH: What he went on to say was that the sanctions on North Korea are working. But you can bet that if he succeeds at neutralizing the North Korean threat, President Trump will point out that he did what others couldn't. Tamara Keith, NPR News.
Trump wouldn't own Trumpcare (or was it Ryancare?), but this tax overhaul is all him. For now, Republican leaders are saying they're OK with that (at least publicly).
Former President Donald Trump derisively referred to the coronavirus as the China virus, as recently as in a statement Wednesday.
STEIN: You know, the virus could surge again in the winter. But hopefully it won't be anything like what the country's just been through and the virus won't be gone. New variants could emerge. So we may need new versions of the vaccines, booster shots, but life could look a lot more like normal life by the end of the year.
Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony until 1898, when the U.S. gained control of it, along with Guam and the Philippines, as part of the terms ending the Spanish-American War. Shortly thereafter, Congress passed a bill declaring Puerto Rico an unorganized territory. This designation meant that Puerto Ricans were not yet U.S. citizens, but did provide them with a seat in the U.S. House.
Republicans were frustrated and taken by surprise by the timing of the president's announcement last week that steel and aluminum tariffs were imminent. Republicans generally support a more targeted approach to pushing back on cheap foreign imports — a message they delivered directly to Trump in several recent meetings. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, one of the top Republicans in the Senate, was among those who were caught off guard last week when Trump made the announcement.
Saudi Arabia needs to be part of that change, he adds, as the country has little time to waste.
We wanted a middle-class tax cut. We wanted to have a system that's more fair, much simpler.
The addition of small changes in the shopping destinations of individuals can dramatically impact the spatial distribution of money flows in the city, and the frequency of encounters between residents of different neighborhoods, even if the total number of changes remains small.
So no — this is not normal behavior.
SALTER: They've all got to - I mean, I was very gratified by Senator Isakson, Senator Romney. And I know Lindsey was - I heard Lindsey say some supportive comments too. But, you know, the problem really isn't, Rachel, that - you know, the problem isn't his disrespect to John or John's family. The problem is Trump. He has no self-control, and he is the most powerful man on the planet. And that's what Republicans - all Republicans, for the sake of the party's future, for the sake of the country - ought to be saying, ought to be addressing. It's glaringly obvious. This man's unfit for the office.
FOLKENFLIK: Well, a lot of the time when Donald Trump's been responding to controversies during this campaign season, they've been controversies of his own making - something he said, some outrage. These are things that he's tossed off. In this case, Donald Trump made a public promise to raise money for veterans' groups and said he had essentially achieved that goal through his fundraiser back in January. In this case, The Washington Post and other news outlets had been looking into how much money veterans' group had gotten from the Trump fundraiser and found that it was a lot short of that $6 million goal. And the real question's whether or not Donald himself had made good on the promise to give a million dollars towards the $6 million himself.
ORDOÑEZ: Yeah. It's a big issue. Vice President Pence actually addressed this. He talked about companies like Honeywell and 3M increasing their production of masks. But he also thanked some other industries for donating the masks that they have.
But we'll start with the interview I recorded with him in 2005 after the publication of his book Character Is Destiny. This was five years after he'd lost the Republican presidential primary to George W. Bush. When we spoke, he was considering running for president in 2008. He did run, but lost to Barack Obama. McCain requested that those two former opponents speak at his funeral. We talked about many things in these interviews, including his 5 1/2 years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and his years as a Republican senator from Arizona. This 2005 interview begins with a story that involves his mother, who has survived him and is now 106.
Other notable takeaways of the survey include:
This is not going to happen without policy support, she says. We need production tax credits for renewable natural gas and hydrogen just like we put in place for wind and solar.
LIASSON: That was a lot to do, and he didn't do it all.
The other thing to remember is that, in fact, most people, the majority of people, do show up to court dates, and when people don't show up to court, this is not El Chapo sitting in the tunnels waiting for Sean Penn and the cameras to show up. These are people who live in the community, and the reasons why people don't show up to court are they can't get of work, they have child care agreements, they forgot the appointment, they never got proper notice of the appointment, the appointment was changed, their address was changed. And there are mechanisms that we can put in place that are actually focused on getting people back to court that don't necessarily involve bail.
In the months leading up to the administration's March 2018 announcement of the addition of a citizenship question, Jones was advising Jarmin, who was the bureau's then-acting director. Commerce Department officials who were under pressure from Ross to get the question on the census relied on Jones as a point of contact.
This is a city controlled by Democratic politicians at every level, and unless we change policies, we will not change results. One hundred percent.
SAGAL: He used to brag about you all the time.
First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy?
LIASSON: They thought they had one. Remember; the mantra before the election was that Trump's world would change because the House of Representatives would have subpoena power. But now we're finding out, what if they issued a subpoena and no one came? I don't think that the House anticipated that he would really stiff them across the board. And in some ways, the very idea of Congress holding oversight over the executive branch is being challenged.
What we're trying to do, is really compile and organize all of this to give us an opportunity to stay ahead of some the violence and crime in the city, Baraka says.
Souring On Sweet? Voters In 4 Cities Pass Soda Tax Measures
At least one of the firms said it will also use a new corporate tax break created last year as part of the CARES Act meant to help companies struggling during the pandemic.
But I also should add that this weekend, the first Republican member of Congress - Justin Amash of Michigan became the first Republican to say that Trump's conduct meets the threshold of impeachment.
SHAPIRO: ...Or a thumbs-down amazing interesting?
We are going to take care of and have been taking care of the American public and the American economy, Trump said.
And so the result of that is you have 27 million children in our country who do not get the full maximum amount because their parents do not make enough money. So roughly, for example, half of the Black children in the U.S. do not receive the maximum child tax credit because their parents don't make enough money.

There are still several major issues that have not been resolved, according to aides.
Leaders say they are on the same page as the Trump administration on an agenda that has expanded to the first 200 days in part to accommodate extra scheduling burdens in the Senate related to the confirmation process for Trump's Cabinet and an upcoming Supreme Court nominee.
The trial would have been Manafort's second; he was convicted last month by a federal jury in Virginia on eight of 18 counts in a bank and tax fraud case related to money he earned in Ukraine.
After the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, any candidate can more easily seek out wealthy donors to essentially fund her or his rise. And this is a threat to parties: the Koch brothers' political operation, for example, now rivals the Republican National Committee in size, as Politico pointed out in December.
Plus, it would cause interest rates on U.S. debt to soar. That would mean higher borrowing costs for the U.S. government — making the very fiscal situation Trump is worried about even worse.
You know, almost everywhere, teachers, of course, are asking for raises. And they're asking for more for their schools, like we heard from this English teacher, Sharonne Hapuarachy, in Los Angeles last month.
Well, he added at the time, maybe it could be removed.
There are three childhood disruptors that account for why the U.S. ranking is relatively low, says Miles, One was our infant mortality rate, which is by global standards, pretty high. The second was the teen pregnancy rate, which, although it's getting better in the United States, it's still, again, globally quite high, Miles says.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So just let me clarify this - your daughter was helped by a policy under the Obamacare legislation?
As a result, the 2019 paid leave bill was the most lobbied legislation in Colorado that session, according to backers, with more than 200 lobbyists registered as working on it. But, ultimately, lawmakers were unable to come to an agreement and instead established a task force to study the issue.
MARTIN: But that's a significant number. Two-hundred billion dollars would represent an increase in U.S. exports to China of more than 50%, right? I mean, how realistic is that really?
ROMER: And then, Larry stopped paying his federal income tax, and you know what happened?
The government's intention [with the new laws] is that farmers should have multiple platforms for selling – not just the APMCs – so that they have choice and can get better prices based on competition, Bathla says. The problem is, agriculture prices are subject to a lot of volatility. Farmers have gotten used to this safety net, and now they are not willing to go for a change.
1. Fund the cost-sharing reduction payments for the long term
Consumer advocates also point to the wellness regulations as a problematic area of the law. The health law increased the financial incentives that employers can offer workers for participating in workplace wellness programs to 30 percent of the cost of individual coverage, up from 20 percent.
KEITH: Foreign policy is something that we said would come up in this debate And, lo and behold, it did come up in this debate. One of our predictions was correct (laughter).

OSNOS: Yeah. I spoke to Julie Myers Wood, for instance, who was the head of Immigration Customs and Enforcement under George W. Bush, and she is opposed to Donald Trump-stated policies on immigration in many ways. But she also said that it's a big mistake to assume that his ideas are so radical as to therefore be impossible, and that was her major point to me was that there are tools that are at the disposal of a president that would allow them to do this dramatic escalation of deportations. For instance, a president could give the IRS files to ICE, to Immigrations Customs Enforcement. So IRS files are considered to be the most reliable source of home addresses because a lot of undocumented immigrants who pay taxes, for instance, put in a reliable home address so that they can receive their refund.
Aparna Mathur, a resident scholar in economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, says the new tax credit sidesteps a common pitfall in the eyes of many Republicans by not requiring employers to provide paid leave. The tax credit also is appropriately aimed at lower-wage workers — who are the ones least likely to have access to paid leave, says Mathur, who co-authored a recent report on paid family leave.
But - so I believe that the point is that if we ever send our young people into conflict, we have to have clear-cut goals. We have to have a clear strategy for victory and recognize that if the American people don't support that conflict, then inevitably, you are bound to fail. And that's why I admire former President Bush's ability to marshal American public opinion prior to our military engagement in the Persian Gulf War.
SANDERS: You know, many of my opponents are saying, oh, Bernie. It's too much. We can't pay teachers a living wage. We can't make public colleges and universities' tuition should free. Really? That's exactly what we intend to do.
They could put a lot of pressure on state parties to comply with that, he said. They could say, look, if you still want your full share of delegates in the next election, you better sign onto this.
Later - I mean, pardon me - earlier during the briefing, Trump also said he had enacted or had the Defense Production Act - Defense Powers Act. And this will help distribution. But he is also saying, quote, We're not a shipping clerk. And he really wants states to order their own supplies.
And in a year like no other, colleges are bracing for an influx of student requests. Tejada says that works to a student's advantage. A lot of people [at the college you're applying to] know what's happening right now. So no one is in their own bubble, he says. But the most important thing is that you speak up about it.

SuperPACs Support Anti-Trump Effort With $16 Million In Attacks
Affordable Care Act Hits More Road Bumps
But some analysts say they're unsure if the new federal policy will make a difference since states have already implemented similar strategies.
Atlantic City is more than a vacation spot. It's your livelihoods. It's how you support your families. Now, this city has its share of big names on big buildings. But you and I know it was built by small businesses and the people who work to make it happen here. As a daughter of a small-business man, whose hard work sent me to college, I have a special place in my heart for the contractors, the craftsmen and the shopkeepers who built this city and keep it going.
Kim Heiting, senior vice president of operations for NW Natural, says her company's pipelines — a vast network of them — don't have to deliver fossil fuels.
On this threaded plate you can hang four Mercedes-Benz S-Classes on, he says. That's the equivalent of 8 tons — you could weld this small threaded plate to a steel girder, then hang four large automobiles from it, and the threads would not strip, the part would not fail.
Donald Trump's business has benefitted from tax abatements, tax subsidies, changes in zoning laws for his building projects. I think both of them represent what's wrong with America, now what the right solution for America is.
If you look in general in a place like - there are four areas of the country now that have what we call community spread. And that's in California, that's in Florida, that's in New York, and that's in Washington state. And in those places, what's being done is what we call community mitigation. In other words, try and socially distance oneself, perhaps closing schools - maybe not in every place but at least considering it; staying out of crowded places and not traveling in a sense where you could come back and bring the infection back. Those are the kind of things that are being done right now.
Trump also promised to withdraw from a proposed Asia-Pacific trade deal that's been in the works. Both those moves would be well within the new president's authority.
Midwest: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Wisconsin
Castro would provide housing vouchers to all families who need help. Right now, only 1 in 4 families eligible for housing assistance gets it. He would also increase government spending on new affordable housing by tens of billions of dollars a year and provide a refundable tax credit to the millions of low- and moderate-income renters who have to spend more than 30% of their incomes on housing.
Worries about the coronavirus are hitting the global economy hard.
One of the biggest challenges Trump faces is that about about 20 million people today have health coverage because of the Affordable Care Act, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The uninsured rate hit an all-time low of 8.9 percent this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
DAVIES: What's the argument? I mean, why does the state have to be uniform in these areas? What's the argument for preventing communities from tailoring legislation to their own needs and interests?
Baylor of the Alliance Defending Freedom said regulatory relief, if provided, would still be inadequate.
NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis contributed to this report.
SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving, thanks so much.
Over the years, Trump has eagerly sought out federal, state and local tax breaks whenever possible, and they have added significantly to his bottom line. When he built Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in the 1980s, he successfully sued the city to get a tax abatement on the property.
GREENE: You used the term precarious. And I think even many Republicans would say that this is a precarious moment because there's a lot at stake here to get some kind of legislative victory. I mean, how much do you see at stake here for the Republican Party?
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans:
Looking out at all the amazing patriots here today, I have never been more confident in our nation's future. Well, I have to say, we have to be a little bit careful. That's a nice statement, but we have to be a little careful with that statement.
CAMPBELL: High school teacher Joe Thomas says Arizona's problem is clear.
For years, Democrats have gotten away with election fraud and weak Republicans. And that's what they are. There's so many weak Republicans. And we have great ones. Jim Jordan and some of these guys, they're out there fighting. The House guys are fighting. But it's, it's incredible.
HORSLEY: Well, the biggest question is, can they get it together, and can they do it quickly? And House Democrats appear to be moving on one track; the White House on another. The president continued to press last night for a payroll tax cut. There seems to be very little appetite on Capitol Hill for that. Certainly, Democrats don't like the idea, and Republicans aren't very keen on it either.
Rachel Martin talks to Mark Salter, a longtime aide to former Sen. McCain. The president has spent the week insulting McCain, who died 7 months ago. NPR's Domenico Montanaro weighs in on the topic.
Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort pleaded guilty on Friday and agreed to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The question I have for my right-to-life friends - and I do take the moral seriousness of their position very seriously - is what - do they honestly think that outlawing abortion will actually end abortion? There are 20 million unsafe abortions around the world. Most of them happen in countries where abortion is illegal. So making abortion illegal is not going to reduce the number of abortions anywhere near to the point that right-to-lifers believe.
These are the facts: Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration's rollback of criminal enforcement. Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's fifty largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years.
Evans said no one informed the church that HUD would be holding a press conference on its property and said he did not believe that the Trump administration was doing enough to help people in his community.
Louail and Lenormand had to work hard to ensure the experiment was realistic by keeping things like travel time constant. No one is going an hour out of their way to buy cat food in a different neighborhood. But after adding these kinds of constraints to their experiment, the pair found a set of results that was, in the end, both surprising and encouraging.
They offered an incredible benefits package, which is unheard of for field staff, offering $8,000 a month for a regional role in addition to health care, technology, laptops, cellphones, said Jethwani.

One off-the-record session titled Is Government Funding Replaceable? was packed solid.
He wonders, is it all just tough talk from Donald Trump? Or is the president really serious about pulling out of NAFTA and imposing a border tax on Mexican goods?
In an email to Jarmin last year about conservative groups Ross could speak with while weighing the pros and cons of adding a citizenship question, Jones suggested reaching out to Mark Krikorian and Steven Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies. Both are longtime advocates of using a citizenship question's responses to exclude noncitizens from census numbers that determine each state's share of congressional seats.
DAVIS: Virginia Democratic Congressman Don Beyer, thank you for speaking with us.
The objective of the SRB program is to increase the number of reenlistments in critical MOSs [Military Occupational Specialty] that do not have adequate retention levels to man the career force. Although Department of Defense policy permits SRB payments of up to $45,000.00, soldiers may be paid bonuses up to six times their monthly basic pay at discharge, times the number of years of additional obligated service, or $20,000.00, whichever is less.
MCCAIN: You know, I don't know, Terry, because one of the aspects of my life which, being a child of the '50s, that I was expected - it was just sort of a natural evolutionary thing that I was going to be - go to the Naval Academy and be in the Navy. And that was partially what I rebelled against either consciously or subconsciously by being such a ne'er-do-well at the Naval Academy. I'm sure there were some regulations that I didn't break while I was at the Naval Academy but not many.
BLOUNT, JR.: Or your nose itches.

We need tariffs, but when it starts to impact the company where you work ... you're thinking, well wait a minute, time out! he said.
Zuckerberg has long said the only way to build a social network that connects billions of people is for the platform to be free to use and supported by advertising. It is often said that when a tech service is free, users pay mightily with their data. And that is the case with Facebook, which compiles its own portrait of its users through granular behavior tracking and also has a lucrative business of selling data to third-parties, like data brokers and advertisers.
NASHIK, India – In a dusty lot outside a wholesale market in western India, farmer Ambadas Sanap leans on the lip of his flatbed truck, surrounded by crates of green peppers and tomatoes. If he could get away from all this for just one day, he says, he'd travel to the capital to protest.
Apple says not so fast. CEO Tim Cook tweeted last month about the need for greater control over data privacy from safeguarding your health & financial data to guarding against algorithms that perpetuate rampant misinformation. We need transparency and reform.
It's the premiums that are giving Meadows pause, while for more moderate Republicans the concern is millions of people who would be without health care or would see their out of pocket costs increase drastically as less generous tax credits replace Obamacare subsidies under the GOP bill.
That is why Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change. Never ever.
During the interview process, he said he confirmed repeatedly that the job would last through November.
Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who also sits on the Budget Committee, was there for Corker's remarks this week. He says Republicans risk defeat because they are employing the same tactics they used on health care to try to get a tax bill passed.
The vote came days after the United States surpassed 500,000 deaths from COVID-19.
Government involvement — along with the support of NGOs and media coverage — have noticeably improved the menstruation situation for girls in Kenya, says Catherine Onyango, who leads ZanaAfrica's advocacy efforts. In the past few years, she's even noticed a shift in the language people use around the issue. When talking about a sanitary pad, men used to call it this thing that is used by women, she says. But now, they're not afraid of the word pad. Onyango says: The way we discuss schoolbooks, we can discuss it.
SANDERS: I honestly don't know, but I will tell you this. We have received over 5 million individual campaign contributions since we began this campaign, averaging about $27.
The draft bill, labeled confidential and dated Feb. 6, adds nuclear to the state's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard — requiring companies to purchase 50 percent of their electricity from a newly-created tier 3 list of sources: nuclear, solar, wind, low-impact hydropower and geothermal.
She compared the effort to Mitt Romney's organization in 2012, where she was deputy campaign manager. The campaign and a pro-Romney superPAC spent $10 million in 10 days before the Florida primary, all of it targeting candidate Newt Gingrich and driving him out of the race.

Shakir played a role in urging Biden to record a video this week encouraging a unionization effort among Amazon warehouse employees in Alabama — a step that went far beyond how previous Democratic presidents have engaged in specific labor disputes. It led to big cheers from progressive quarters.

Basically, we call ourselves a startup campus because we actually have 28 different incubators, but also a ton of services, Vanier says. In a few months we're going to have a housing extension so entrepreneurs from everywhere in the world will be able to come, attend a startup program, live, eat, meet other entrepreneurs.
Kaine accepted his nomination as the vice presidential nominee and during his speech, he mocked Trump.
GREENE: OK, so yesterday, Putin comes out and announced changes to Russia's government. What exactly is he saying here?
But in interviews with people like Borders across remote Idaho timber country in the last year, it's clear dramatic changes are afoot. Clearwater County voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump, who campaigned that he'd be a champion for rural America again. In rural western counties like this that are heavily dependent on the booms and busts of natural resource economies, Trump's message of getting the miners back to mining and loggers back to logging resonated. But in the year since Trump took office, some in rural Idaho still feel a disconnect with Washington.
SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: President Biden's rescue package includes nearly $350 billion to help governors and mayors fill the holes the pandemic has left in their budgets. But after meeting with Biden earlier this month, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said, no, thanks.
And in many cases, an employer would also have a tough time arguing that decade-old lapses in its own oversight should trigger wage garnishments and tax liens against its workers. But again, this is the U.S. military, and its officials say the law requires them to reclaim the overpayments.
In 2020, Burke says, expect to see more satellite-based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers. And although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the U.S. and the European Union, more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries — including Ethiopia's first observatory satellite, launched in late December. — Tim McDonnell
SELYUKH: Blue is a director at Matthew Peck Art Gallery in the French Quarter. Just months after a grand opening, it's now temporarily closed, one of many victims of the collapse of travel and tourism due to the coronavirus pandemic.
This is the secret sauce of budget reconciliation, Moller said. It's a lot smoother, and you don't have to deal with the filibuster, because at the end of the time, they just start taking votes.
PARNAS: President Trump knew exactly what was going on. He was aware of all of my movements. He - I wouldn't do anything without the consent of Rudy Giuliani or the president.
In other words, he gave a president who seems to thrive on a certain amount of chaos exactly what he wanted, and that worked for Mulvaney and Trump both.
NORTHAM: No, he's not crossing any legal lines, certainly. And the legal experts I spoke with said they didn't really think he was violating any ethical rules. But, Rachel, the problem here is the optics. You know, Justice Gorsuch was President Trump's Supreme Court nominee, and now he's delivering a speech at Trump's hotel. And there are cases involving the Trump administration that could come before the high court, such as the travel ban, and the Trump hotel itself is in the center of several lawsuits. So there's concern Gorsuch's speech at the hotel could undermine the public's confidence in the independence of the court.
Dr. Anthony Fauci is one of the people leading the response to the coronavirus. He is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and he's on the line now. Good morning, Dr. Fauci.
Lawyers said the special counsel may have been motivated to use a search warrant over concerns that evidence might be concealed or destroyed, which sometimes happens in terrorism and drug trafficking cases. Or, they said, Mueller may have been moving quickly amid a series of existential threats. In recent weeks, President Trump has blasted the Russia investigation as a witch hunt and flirted with the idea of firing Justice Department leaders as a roundabout way to get rid of Mueller himself.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked on Wednesday about how seriously the Trump administration took Putin's requests; she told reporters they were being evaluated.
My folks worked for the same place for 35 years and retired from there and that was never an option for me, Deuberry says. You can't trust companies to look out for your best interests anymore. After his corporate job was outsourced, he got into contract work. That has allowed him to make enough money beyond making ends meet, but he worries about not being able to find work if the economy takes a downward turn. I've got the house, got the car, got a kid, he says.I'm pretty content making the money I'm making now. It's more than I need, honestly.
ELVING: Hard to imagine it could be, Scott. And, you know, Homeland Security officials had been denying this idea was really under consideration right up until the president said he was still thinking about it. So it was much like the way he threatened to close the border earlier this month, then said he'd wait a year, then said he was still thinking about doing that, too. So look. In all likelihood, the president does know that these are just rhetorical devices. But he sees how they dominate the discussion. And they reassure anyone who might have doubted this president will go on trying to win his border crisis with ever more extreme measures to punish the migrants and their defenders.

And this is one of the ways in which he might find himself facing greater opposition than he expected from his own party because there are people in the House, certainly, and some also in the Senate who would be offended by the idea of introducing these enormous new costs. That's one of the things that I think is hard to anticipate at the outset, but he's almost likely - certainly likely to kick in after the honeymoon between, you know, the Republicans on the Hill and this new Republican White House is over.

SCHRAGER: (Laughter) I am living in a small apartment attached to our garage. The reason I'm out here is that we have a newborn in the house.

Thousands of Americans turned out in cities across the country yesterday calling on President Trump to do something every president has done going back to Gerald Ford - release his tax returns. Violence erupted at one of those rallies, and many people were arrested in Berkeley, Calif., where groups that support and oppose the president clashed. But there was also a protest near Mar-a-Lago, the private club where the president is spending this Easter weekend. From West Palm Beach, NPR's Greg Allen reports.

Trump also called for a $1.5 trillion package to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure in partnership with state and local governments, and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment.
KAHN: I just think no. If tens of thousands of Central Americans had to resettle in Guatemala, there's no way this poor country could assimilate and care for them without substantial assistance from the U.S. And I actually went to Guatemala's tiny asylum office when I was there earlier this month. The woman who runs this office - and there's only eight employees there - she was just quite blunt. I asked her right out, could you handle a rush of new applicants? And she said no.

And my mission in the White House will be to make our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. This is personal for me. I am a product of the American middle class. I was born in Chicago. I was raised in a suburb. But my grandfather worked at the Scranton lace mill in Scranton, Pennsylvania, for fifty years. And because he worked hard, my dad was able to go to college, and eventually start his own small business – and send me off into the world to follow my dreams.
DEMBOSKY: Rosales graduated last year, and now she's advocating for a bill that would make it easy for students like her to get a medication abortion at all 34 campuses of the University of California and California State University.
Overall, Americans' outlook under Trump is dismal. Almost double say the country is on the wrong track as those who think it's on the right track, 61 percent to 31 percent, a gap that has nearly doubled since February.
INSKEEP: This is an interesting point of view. You will find Democrats who take this point of view. You will sometimes find Republicans who take this point of view. I think you're telling me not that the deficit is meaningless, but don't worry about it; it doesn't matter as much as some other things.
For those Reddit members, all this isn't just about making money. There's also kind of a populist thing happening here with a lot of these traders, judging by the Reddit threads.

And both the former presidents were arguing that immigration had been a positive force in American history, building the country as we know it today. And both of them said that this current emphasis in this administration on nationalism was verging into nativism, the ultimate narrow vision of who is an American.

Thomas Gentzel, executive director and CEO of the National School Boards Association, said Thursday that, unlike private schools, public schools are fully accountable for the public funds they receive. School board officials support choice, and employ a lot of creative ideas to provide it, but sending tax dollars to schools that lack local supervision is not an appropriate use of taxpayer funds.
But a family earning between $40,000 and $50,000 a year would get a tax cut of only $560, she says, and millions of middle-class working families will see their tax bills rise under Trump's plan — especially single-parent families.
A 529 plan lets families save money for college. Think of it as a love child, born in the mid '90s to your federal and state governments. And they named it, in a flash of creativity, after its relevant section in the Internal Revenue Code.
One big reason President Trump won in 2016 was his success in Pennsylvania. His message about jobs and bringing back struggling industries resonated even with many Democrats. In 2018, if Democrats end up succeeding and taking control of the House, a big reason could be Pennsylvania. The state Supreme Court threw out its congressional map this year, re-drew district lines, and Democrats think they can flip a number of seats. They took some first steps yesterday as Pennsylvania, along with a number of other states, held primaries. And Democrat Chrissy Houlahan won in a district that includes some Philadelphia suburbs as well as the city of Reading. She joins me this morning.
Then the president pointed to Guaidó, who was sitting in the first lady's box. The announcement sparked a standing ovation, including from the House speaker. Trump called him a very brave man who carries with him the hopes, dreams and aspirations of all Venezuelans.

Georgia has become a haven for movie and television production because of attractive tax incentives offered to studios that film there. Unlike California's film tax credit program, Georgia's offering is especially enticing because it allows studios and film producers to offset actors' salaries, which can be a major contributor to the cost of productions.
Still, Landell is dreaming of a bright future.

It's a steamy, verdant tomato jungle: about two football fields' worth of tomato plants, shooting some 10 feet up into the air.

The 2019 tax records for the Republican Governors Association also show more than $200,000 in donations from Nevada casino companies around the time of the Louisiana election.

Most important among the skeptics is Trump. He has said he doesn't love the border adjustment tax, calling it too complicated.
The U.S. Supreme Court, in a one-sentence unsigned order, declined former President Donald Trump's request to further delay the enforcement of a subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney for Trump's financial records. Monday's order paves the way for a New York grand jury to obtain the records and review them.

But you already have Republican critics saying, wait a second, what's going on? Is this entitlement? Is this Obamacare-lite? David Brooks, is this thing still on the rails - this replacement plan?
As rates climb, consumers will end up paying higher interest on their credit cards, mortgages and auto loans.
Efforts to prop up the state's nuclear plants have been controversial. A similar bill introduced last month in the House faces opposition from electric utilities, the natural gas industry, manufacturers, environmental organizations, and consumer groups. House Bill 11 also has a similar price tag.
I just really want to see what they do. I just want to see how they covered. I've never seen anything like it. But it would be really great if we could be covered fairly by the media.

CHANG: The White House could also make a decision soon on certain appliances most of us rely on every day. The president is said to be considering sweeping tariffs on Chinese-manufactured washing machines, also solar panels because domestic makers of these goods say they have been hurt by Chinese imports. If these tariffs were to happen, how would American consumers and even American workers be affected?

Steve Bannon has called Breitbart, which was his media organization, quote, the platform of the alt right, unquote. And that is the previously fringe movement on the conservative far-right edge, which was founded by Richard Spencer who lives in Montana and believes in the separation of the races. And that has now moved sort of further into the mainstream as a result of Steve Bannon's rise within the Trump campaign and now his installation in the White House. But in order to get those ideas accomplished, you need somebody who really is just as skilled as anyone in sort of managing the levers of inside power in Washington, and that's where Reince Priebus comes in.
The Democratic base is made up of young people and minorities and also educated professionals. And all of those groups tend to be open to trade, Galston said.

Not only are they voting, they want an application to vote. One of them was 29 years ago, died. It's incredible. Over 14,000 ballots were cast by out-of-state voters, so these are voters that don't live in this state.
The more uncertainty there is, the more the actuaries are going to be plugging into their projections for premium rates, says Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute.

The economy has passed the mountaintop losing some altitude during the final quarter of 2018, but it is not about to crash. To the contrary, the flight path ahead looks quite safe, economist Sung Won Sohn said.
KAMENETZ: You know, it's interesting. We actually did a poll last year about this. And we found across the country strong public support for teachers right to strike no matter your political leanings. You know, teachers are really close to their communities. People in polls in general really support their public schools. As you heard from that teacher in LA, teachers have been really careful when they're asking for more money for themselves. They're also asking for things that are for the kids. You know, we're doing it for the kids.
California's marketplace has had its share of problems. A reliance on inaccurate provider directories left some consumers exposed to higher-than-expected medical bills. Consumers also complained about narrow networks that left them unable to choose the doctors they wanted.

After Backlash, Including From Trump, House GOP Drops Weakening Of Ethics Office
As for whether or not this benefits wealthy people and business owners like President Trump, of course it does. I mean, there's a decrease in the tax rate for the highest-income earners. The repeal of the estate tax, a tax on wealthy families that leave money to their children - that tax only affects those with estates of $5 1/2 million or more. There's a repeal of the alternative minimum tax aimed at high-income earners and a massive reduction in the corporate tax rate. Trump, of course, wealthy and a business owner - so either the president doesn't know what's in his plan or he's lying.
Several of the law's provisions apply to plans offered by large employers, too (with some exceptions for plans that were in place before the law passed in March 2010).
All right we're going to get past the media strategy and into some substance with our Friday regulars, columnist David Brooks of The New York Times. Hey there, David.
DAVIES: So it may be legally sound but not the way we're used to governing ourselves?
GREENE: Listening to the president there - a big number, substantial relief. Can you help us understand exactly what he's talking about?
In one sense, Avenatti may have been lucky, from his perspective. First, he sued on behalf of Daniels so she could escape the contract she signed pledging not to talk about the sexual relationship she says she had with Trump in 2006.
Bernie Sanders: Well, thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be with you.
So I just want you to take all this information and tell everybody you can. Because people need to make an informed choice. So when Trump says he is for working men and women of America, but Trump Furniture is made in Turkey instead of Lakewood, N.J., that matters. Trump Suits were made in Mexico, instead of Ashland, Pa. Trump Lamps are made in China, not Altoona, Pa.
Hogg doesn't use a lot of close-ups, preferring to shoot her characters from a distance, showing you the spaces in which they live and work. She loves to fill the frame with telling details, from the stuffed animals on Julie's bed to the old-school editing machine she uses to cut her film.

Manning emphasized that neither Hofeller nor his views were part of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' decision to approve including a citizenship question on 2020 census forms.
MCCAIN: ...Very quickly. I think that - look; we had a decision to make early on in 1964 perhaps at the latest that we were either going to do whatever is necessary to win or don't go into the conflict at all. I could argue with you that it would have been probably a smart thing not to go in given the risk of Chinese and Russian intervention, that we couldn't win without, you know, full-scale operations which perhaps the American people wouldn't have supported, et cetera, et cetera.

And he wants to wipe out the tough rules we put on big banks after the financial crisis. He'd rig the economy for Wall Street all over again. So we shouldn't be surprised. Of course he'd be for protecting a system where the rich and powerful stick it to everybody else. He got rich playing by those rules and he wants to keep it that way.
The treasury secretary goes on to argue that the legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically-motivated disclosures of personal tax information, regardless of which party is in power.
And Barr has been adopting President Trump's language, saying spying occurred. Spying implies an abuse of power. It's quite different than saying there was legally approved surveillance. And that has revived criticisms that Barr is acting more as the president's private defense lawyer than as the top law enforcement officer in the U.S.
But these are the things you don't hear about. You don't hear what you just heard. I'm going to go over a few more states. But you don't hear it by the people who want to deceive you and demoralize you and control you. Big tech, media.
Trump's Immigration Plan Could Undermine Promise To Boost Economy
It was in the range of 70 to 80 percent in favor for paid sick, for increased minimum wage, for having this predictive scheduling and for having expanded paternity and family leave. And so what you have is a situation in which these are popular policies, the people want them, and now we have evidence that even - many businesses want them and support them. But you have a pretty narrow - a set of people who are actively arguing against them and using, I think, some deeply flawed studies to try to oppose these really popular and good policies.
That could be due to the shift in public attitudes toward the ACA in recent weeks.
As a candidate Trump showed indifference or hostility to many civil liberties, which incorporate the freedom of speech, expression and assembly embedded in the media's sense of self. Reporters were herded and penned up at Trump rallies, singled out for abuse, and blacklisted for critical stories, even as their editors negotiated for concessions that seem meager in retrospect.
GILLIBRAND: And it's one I am taking because I'm going to run.

HORSLEY: He is going to have to work with Congress for much of this. There might be some steps the administration could take on its own with existing legislation - things like those small business loans, for example. But much of this would take cooperation from Congress. And interestingly, you heard the president talk about meeting with Mitch McConnell, the Senate leader, and meeting with House Republicans. He didn't talk about meeting with House Democrats, who of course are in the majority and would have to go along with many of these things.
What started off as a strong holiday shopping season ended with a whimper, as consumers, rattled by a trade war and a government shutdown, tightened their belts. The Commerce Department said retail sales fell 1.2 percent between November and December, the sharpest drop in nine years.
HORSLEY: It seems so. The Federal Reserve did its part over the weekend, slashing interest rates to zero, pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into the banking system to keep credit flowing. But even as the central bank took that action, Chairman Jerome Powell said there was a need for Congress and the administration to do more.
But the worst way to approach the conflict is to do it in half measures which frankly people like Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf, who were over there as junior officers and leaders and platoon commanders and air and squadron commanders, understood that we couldn't do that again. And that was reflected in the conduct of Operation Desert Storm. So I'm very ambivalent about the Vietnam War.

He could believe it so strongly that Putin suggested to President Trump in their one-on-one meeting in Helsinki on Monday that Trump allow Russian investigators to come to the U.S. to question McFaul — in exchange for Putin allowing U.S. investigators to travel to Russia to question 12 recently indicted military intelligence officers accused by the Justice Department of hacking and dumping emails associated with the Democratic Party back in 2016.

And that meant I wasn't going to - I was going to spend the time doing town halls, like I've been doing across New Hampshire, because I think we've got a real problem in our democracy.

GRAVES: The state law basically took away the power of local communities to provide rules to help kids and adults who have a different gender than the one on their birth certificate to be able to use restrooms that are most comfortable for them based on their own gender identity.

The payments were not illegal at the time but would become so under rules changes that followed the disclosure. And he used such nasty attack ads against his opponent, Democrat Philip Sharp, that they backfired, according to Sharp, giving the Democratic incumbent a much larger victory over his GOP opponent than in Pence's first run.

A single parent who's earning $75,000 and has two school-age children, they would face a tax increase of over $2,400, Batchelder says. That's if they had no child-care deductions; the increase in taxes comes partly because the Trump plan eliminates the $4,000 exemption for each person in a household.
Senate Republicans on Thursday unveiled their plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act — also known as Obamacare. The long-awaited plan marks a big step toward achieving one of the Republican Party's major goals.
You're right. The economy is doing really great for people like Mr. Bloomberg and other billionaires, he said. But you know what, for the ordinary American, things are not so good.
But even by those measures, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in last year's presidential election is moving with unusual speed and assertiveness, according to half a dozen legal experts following the probe.
Richmond says he signed the contract in good faith, and in his petition, he describes a scenario that's reminiscent of the recent Wells Fargo cross-selling scandal, saying that a lower-ranking figure has been punished for committing fraud that was motivated at least in part by a need to meet targets set by her superiors.
It's at 35 right now. So if it got down to 21, I would certainly, I would be thrilled, Trump said. We haven't set that final figure yet, but certainly 21 is a very great difference.
Danilo Trisi, one of those authors, says the drop in child poverty was due in large part to the federal safety net programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, and the earned income tax credit help low-income families make ends meet.

Rieder and his Georgetown collaborators have a proposal, and the first thing they stress is that it's not like China's abusive one-child policy. It aims to persuade people to choose fewer children with a strategy that boils down to carrots for the poor, sticks for the rich.
COHN: Well, Harry Reid had a tough job. They needed 60 votes. And they had 60 members of the Democratic caucus, could not lose a single member. The most famous compromise he had to make was on the public option. Progressive Democrats really wanted that. They felt like they had given up so much already. But a number of Democrats were against it. The most vocal of them was Joe Lieberman from Connecticut. And Lieberman basically made very clear, he said, I will not have a public option. If there's a public option in this bill, I will join a Republican filibuster. And you won't be able to pass this. And Reid tried his best to come up with some compromise. He set up a committee with moderate and liberal Democrats. They thought they had an alternative. Lieberman came out against that as well. And he had to drop it. And analogous a little bit to what Pelosi went through with abortion, Reid had to go to his progressive members and say, look, I did my best. I tried to do this. I don't like it. We don't have a choice.
She thinks that Congress will be under more pressure than usual to cut safety net spending — health care, housing assistance, welfare and food aid — to help pay for Trump's massive tax cut plans.
More immediately, there might be some effect on premiums for next year. Health insurers are currently deciding whether to sell coverage in the individual market in 2019 — and what they're going to charge.
BIDEN: I think we should have a debate on health care. I think - I know that the senator says she's for Bernie. Well, I'm for Barack. I think the Obamacare worked. I think the way - we add to it, replace everything that's been cut. Add a public option, guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance.
The point isn't the contract that we signed that said at-will, said Jeweler. It's the countless conversations that 2,000 former staffers had with hiring people who all said you have a guaranteed job through November. It's written on official interview documents that they used internally.
But the U.S. economy isn't in a recession right now. It's in the longest postwar economic expansion on record, with very low interest rates and very high corporate profits.

Secular stagnationistas are arguing that now is the time to spend big, on things like roads, bridges and a Green New Deal. That's one way to increase investment in the economy and get us out of this hole. Of course, many disagree. They have faith that new technologies in the pipeline will expand industry, increase investment and productivity and rescue us from stagnation.
There's plenty of agreement on the problems but not yet on the solutions. Asked which members of Congress the Trump administration had reached out to on the issue, the White House official said simply that Ivanka Trump looks forward to working with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle.

Some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century and create millions of jobs and businesses. It's probably going to be either China, Germany, or America. I want it to be us! We invent the technology, we should make it and use it and export it, which will help to grow our economy.
It still comes down to a handful of wealthy people, said Kent Cooper, a founder of the website Political Money Line, which compiles campaign-finance data. It's just a huge impact on the presidential race, as opposed to the millions of voters around the country.
SANDERS: Number one, let's relax a little bit here. We began at 3 percent in the polls. Since then, we have now won nine states, most of them by very, very large margins. Last night we won Michigan by a point and a half. We started off in very low numbers in the African-American community. Those numbers have been going up. And, in fact, last night in Michigan, as I understand it through exit polls, we won about 32 percent of the African-American vote and maybe one-half of young African-Americans. In Colorado and in Nevada, we believe we won the Latino vote. So we have come a long, long way in a reasonably short period of time. Let me say something about your remarks. There's no candidate who has talked more about poverty in this country than I have. The fact is we have the highest rate of childhood property of any major country on Earth, which is a national disgrace. Thirty-five percent of African-American kids are living in poverty. Fifty-one percent of African-American high school graduates between 17 and 20 are unemployed or underemployed. So when you're talking about poverty, I would suggest to you that I am the candidate who talks and knows more about that issue, I believe, than any other candidate out there and has a legislative agenda that will address those problems - raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, creating...
BIDEN: They do not have to buy in.
The release of the verdict form followed an interview with one of the jurors, Paula Duncan. Duncan told Fox News that she supports the president but documentary evidence against Manafort in the 16-day trial had proved overwhelming.
Finally, Trump throws his support behind the importation of drugs to cut costs. Allowing consumers access to imported, safe and dependable drugs from overseas will bring more options to consumers, the proposal says. This is the one where Trump and Sanders have common ground. Sanders supports the importation of drugs from Canada and his website boasts about a 1999 bus trip that took a group of Americans up north to get better deals.

His office added, This is pure speculation. Spokeswoman AshLee Strong said, As the speaker himself said today, he's not going anywhere any time soon.
They're doing that because Republicans would block the legislation from going to the Senate floor for an up-or-down vote and, instead, make it subject to the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster.
The special counsel's lawyers reported that the jail in Warsaw doesn't allow prisoners to send emails but that Manafort appears to have developed a workaround by reading and drafting messages on a second laptop that's brought in and out of the jail by his legal team.
But congressional Democrats say they're not going to let the possibility of bipartisanship get in the way of passing a needed bill. The vote on the budget resolution sets in motion a decades-old budget rule called reconciliation to get around the 60-vote threshold to end a filibuster and pass the legislation with a simple majority.

PALMIERI: But, see, it's different. It's not as if there's a Democratic Party, which are nine people, sitting in an office on Capitol Hill and deciding what we're all for - right? That is not what's happening. What is happening, which is what you want to see in a party, is a revitalization that is coming from the grass roots up.
House leaders were forced to approve a lengthy technical correction to its legislation Monday. McConnell has predicted bipartisan support to pass that bill in the Senate but noted on Tuesday the need for a broader package that includes more and broader small business relief.
Trump, he said, has run a campaign full of requests for voters to believe him.
CORNISH: And later in the program, we're actually going to hear from Congressman Adam Schiff from the Intel Committee in the House about that. But E.J., you talked about this episode essentially showing the first cracks in the wall of like kind of congressional Republican support because it's been a wall of support, right? Like, whatever he does, it's like we're going to back it.
Here's a quick recap of the highlights — and lowlights — of the first 14 days of Trump's nascent presidency.
One woman looks a little stunned. She's not a climate activist — just tagged along with a friend — and says she had no idea that deciding not to have kids because of the climate was even a thing.
From 1974 to 1989, Wertheimer provided highly praised and award-winning coverage of national politics and Congress for NPR, serving as its congressional and then national political correspondent. Wertheimer traveled the country with major presidential candidates, covered state presidential primaries and the general elections, and regularly reported from Congress on the major events of the day — from the Watergate impeachment hearings to the Reagan Revolution to historic tax reform legislation to the Iran-Contra affair. During this period, Wertheimer covered four presidential and eight congressional elections for NPR.
This is just a start. Because the more we do to help working families, the more our entire economy will benefit.
Sorting out the overlapping lines of the Clinton Foundation and the State Department are murky, because the types of people and groups who are apt to make major donations to a top-tier international nonprofit are the same types of people and groups who would seek out — and be granted — meetings with top State Department officials.
Translation: We're not superheroes here, you know. We don't have the power over the economy that you think we do.
An additional $100 million will be set aside for nutrition assistance grants for U.S. territories (Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and American Samoa).
With respect to the Johnson Amendment, at least technically, the legal effect of the order appears to be minimal, he said.
RAZ: You don't feel comfortable with that?
But on three core ideas, he has stayed completely consistent. One of them is his belief that the United States is fundamentally being damaged by immigration. Number two is his belief that trade deals have done more damage to the United States than they have helped. And number three is his belief that the United States does too much for the world. As he said in 2015, I want to take back everything that the United States has given the world.
George Soros has a thick hide and he can certainly absorb these attacks with grace as he has for some time now and will not be dissuaded, Gaspard added.
If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better than Hillary Clinton's economic agenda. Nothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs right out of existence. The one common feature of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States. Every policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries at our expense. And that's why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us, divide us, and pull us apart.
The new bill makes some big changes from the last BCRA draft, but it also leaves some major parts of the original Senate proposal intact — it would still repeal the individual and employer mandates, it would still mean cuts to Medicaid spending, and it would still allow states to opt out of key parts of Obamacare.
CORNISH: You obviously have a background in activism, but people know you for HBO's Sex And The City. Are we reaching a moment where a celebrity is really what is going to push people over the edge in terms of getting name recognition in office?
HORSLEY: Politically, there wasn't a lot of support for a payroll tax cut on Capitol Hill. And economically, it doesn't really fit the situation we're in. Cutting payroll taxes doesn't help you if you've suddenly been dropped from a payroll because your employer's been shut down.
It's a tough position, you know, to be like, 'Well, we really don't want you to come in, but we really want you to come,'  he said.
Trump delivered an address Monday to the Detroit Economic Club, outlining a plan to cut taxes and get rid of regulations. Today was Hillary Clinton's turn, where she argued that her plan would boost the middle class while Trump's plan would give trillions in tax cuts to big corporations, millionaires, and Wall Street money managers.
You might call it The Schumer Test. It goes something like this: If you're a Republican and Chuck Schumer is happy, then it's likely not a good day.
It is a stupid tax. It's poorly targeted, Burman says.
Then, late Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement that it was aware of and actively monitoring the on-going market volatility and that the agency was working with other regulators to assess the situation and review the activities of regulated entities, financial intermediaries, and other market participants.
He didn't just take advantage of investors. He took advantage of working people as well.
The Copyright Alliance represents plenty of big movie studios and record labels, including Disney, NBCUniversal, Warner Media and ViacomCBS — as well as thousands of independent creators. It's a big tent, which leaves some small creators unsettled.
I think what we need to create, says James, is an 'old girls' club,' with female accountants, tax attorneys, and so forth, who can help women in the culinary field achieve their goals. Good food is important, but it's about so much more than food.
The World Health Organization has now characterized the coronavirus as a global pandemic. After initially downplaying the threat posed by COVID-19, President Trump announced a number of new measures last night to address the outbreak, but he made some serious errors while doing so.
It's locked, he said after trying the handle. This is ridiculous.
We do know that he derives — or did derive — revenue from his partnership with Vornado. They co-manage buildings. They co-own buildings. They collect lease and rental fees together and share them. And that is a baked-in conflict of interest, Connolly says.
Yet privacy advocates and other prominent Facebook critics have raised doubts about whether the change will indeed significantly impact small business as much as profits at Facebook, which generates some 98% of its revenue from advertising.
ROVNER: That's right. On these exchanges that we've talked about, this got announced last Friday, the day after the Fourth of July. No coincidence, I think the administration was trying to make this as invisible as possible. And what they said is that, once again, computer problems mean that when people sign up for insurance on the exchanges, if they're eligible for federal subsidies, they won't get their income checked automatically or verified automatically.
A federal judge in California temporarily blocked the Trump administration's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program late Tuesday night.
As Moore mentioned, European Union and British regulations already require drinks with this much caffeine to sport an extra label stating: High caffeine content. Not recommended for children or pregnant or breast-feeding women. And while a nationwide soda tax will go into effect in the U.K. in April, banning so-called under 16s from buying energy drinks is a voluntary measure that grocery stores have taken up this year.
The Dollar Is Weaker, But That Might Not Be A Bad Thing
Commentator Cokie Roberts talks with Steve Inskeep and answers listener questions about the history of presidents and their tax returns.
Allawi concedes that many of these ideas are not new. In the past, he says, most of these plans foundered because there wasn't the will to sustain them. Oil money was flowing, and the government chose the line of least resistance.
For those who are self-employed, there will be a tax credit equivalent to the sick leave amount.
The portion of non-elderly Americans covered by employer-sponsored plans has stayed almost unchanged since the health law was passed.
I think Betsy DeVos obviously - the education secretary - a big champion of school choice, but she's such a polarizing figure that she may also herself be contributing to the breakdown of that once-bipartisan consensus.
GenDrop rents out generator power for concerts and music festivals. Phelps had already powered nearly 100 special events throughout Michigan, and he hoped to do the same in his new state. But when the pandemic hit, and shows were canceled all over the world, Phelps began bleeding money.

SIMON: He did pretty well yesterday at the end of the primary because he gave a speech that was pretty presidential and quite calm. He just has to stay that way.
Could Trump 'Undermine The Legacy Of The Obama Presidency' With The Stroke Of A Pen?
Nonetheless, as tensions grow in Washington over the future of the health law, it is important to understand some of its effects on large-group plans.
You can dress them up and put a nice suit on him and you can try to ignore it, but that cancer is going to have a devastating effect. You have to be willing to address that issue if you're ever going to solve it, Carson said.
BURKE: So the Trump campaign issued a general denial of the accounts that cast and crew gave us of what they described as his inappropriate behavior toward women on the set of The Apprentice. And Trump's campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, emailed AP a statement saying that these claims were false and outlandish and unsubstantiated and that they had been fabricated by publicity-hungry, disgruntled former employees. But the campaign didn't want to answer specific questions that AP emailed and also declined to give us an interview.
He told the commissioners that he was shocked by their moratorium. Representatives from the Laborers International Union also criticized the moratorium, arguing that it blocked potential new jobs.
Then, you know, I had a chance to actually watch the political process chew over this and see in real time how the idea of universal coverage gets translated into a proposal that then becomes a series of bills that then go through Congress that get signed and is being implemented and fighting resistance efforts at repeal. And, yeah, you get an appreciation for how hard this is. I mean, any kind of large-scale public policy reform is difficult. Health care reform is especially difficult. And I think it did give me some appreciation for the importance of partial success and partial victories, even when they don't accomplish everything you might want and even when there are big parts of them that you think, gosh, that's regrettable; I wish this looked different.
KELLY: That's what they've done. We - but an 800-point drop - how is this supposed to have worked? Cutting interest rates, how is that supposed to help the economy in this specific situation?
And they said hundreds of families fled south to an area where the American forces are operating. Some of the families are living in an abandoned school, we saw. Others found houses to stay in. And still, others say they want to leave the country. And they're angry at America for not protecting them.

The LGBT community has legitimate issues. Those who have concerns about the privacy in the bathroom of women and children or men have legitimate issue as well.
Now, he says, there is political and popular recognition that reform is necessary. The white paper contains hundreds of concrete steps to be enacted over three to five years — the first being the currency devaluation.
IGOR VOLSKY: It gets rid of Obamacare but doesn't talk about coverage expansion, doesn't talk about cost controls. And so we're left in the world where a lot of people are losing the coverage they currently have under Obamacare and they don't actually get anything in return.
Period Equity's most recent undertaking was a public service ad starring celebrity Amber Rose, which was released on YouTube. Rose, clad in a provocative black dress, carefully strokes a diamond pendent and opens the charm to reveal a single tampon. Where else would you keep something 36 states tax as a luxury? the voice-over asks in an unabashed tone.
KELLY: He also said personal income taxes would drop, although rich people wouldn't be able to take so many deductions.
EISBRENNER: Right. She was in between jobs, and instead of having to pay the penalty, she figured she could put those dollars to use and get herself a policy. You know, it helped her out in that situation. You know, for somebody in her age bracket, in her situation, it worked.
The people dreamed this country. The people built this country, and it is the people who are making America great again, Trump said. As long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for — there is nothing we cannot achieve.
It's a place where you need to be wise, Hulst says. I tell them I want to honor Scripture, but I also honor my LGBT brothers and sisters.
Putin blamed the leak not on the reporting consortium that obtained the materials and circulated them to news organizations around the world, but on Russia's Western opponents, which he said were attempting to rock us from within, to make us more obedient.
MARR: Right now, for low-income people who would not have a sizable income tax liability, their eligibility to the child tax credit is tied to their earnings. And what President Biden and Vice President Harris are proposing is to remove that earnings connection. So the result would be that all children essentially would receive the full child tax credit, which would now be increased.
KODJAK: What he meant was that he wants to allow insurance companies to sell policies across state lines. It's a popular idea among Republicans, but beyond that, Trump was criticized because he had little more to offer. Now that's changed. The Trump campaign has posted a seven-point health plan on his website. It includes getting rid of those lines around the states, and it adds a handful of other provisions that are mainstays in conservative health care circles. Joe Antos is a scholar at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute.
LARRY KUDLOW: Let's think about individuals who might lose paychecks because they had to stay home if they get the virus. Let's think about small businesses that might get hurt by this.
I hope the White House corrects the record and denounces in categorical terms this ridiculous request from Putin. Not doing so creates moral equivalency between a legitimacy US indictment of Russian intelligence officers and a crazy, completely fabricated story invented by Putin, McFaul wrote.
MARTIN: Right. So speaking of Bernie Sanders, the primary has really created this big philosophical debate about whether capitalism has failed in this country and if socialism is the answer. I want to get into this with you, Mara, but let's listen to some tape here first. First, Michael Bloomberg.
But Democrats counter that the bill takes a holistic look at the entire American economy and how it has been affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
Fifty-four percent of Americans also say granting legal status to DREAMers should be an immediate priority — 72 percent of Democrats agree along with 51 percent of independents, but only 32 percent of Republicans say the same thing. Instead, 35 percent of GOP voters say it shouldn't be an immediate priority while 29 percent say it shouldn't be a priority at all.
In 1938, economist Alvin Hansen, then the president of the American Economic Association, gave a speech in Detroit at the organization's annual meeting. It had been almost a decade since a stock market crash had ushered in the Great Depression. The recovery had been puny, and the economy had just dipped into yet another recession. Things were looking bad.
MONTANARO: You know, there's a lot there. I mean, any time a candidate decides to run, they have to consider their family and consider what it would mean and do - you know, he said that it's an earthquake for a family, has to be a personal decision. And I did like at the end there how, you know, you tried to ask for a distinction between himself and some of the other potential candidates, and he said he wouldn't do it and then he did.
A pyrotechnic week of geopolitical intrigue has yielded new clarity about the whys and wherefores of the Russia imbroglio, including one insight straight from Russian President Vladimir Putin.
SANDERS: That we can't have a president who is a racist and a sexist and a homophobe and a xenophobe and a religious bigot.
As The Wall Street Journal recently wrote, when Republicans attempted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, they ran into issues rolling back the individual mandate portion of the law.
Progressive groups had hoped to get one of their favorite candidates through in this Los Angeles district where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary last year. But with that vote splintered, Ahn was able to edge through, benefiting from a growing Asian population in the district.
The tax overhaul gave most Americans a break in what they owe the government; however, those tax gains were expected to be spread unevenly across income brackets, with high earners enjoying the biggest windfalls. Households earning between $500,000 and $1 million would see an average income increase of 4.3 percent after taxes, while households earning between $50,000 and $75,000 would see their income increase by an average 1.6 percent after taxes. In all, the average household was expected to get a tax cut of $1,610, the Tax Policy Center calculated.

NPR's Scott Horsley has been listening in with us - NPR's chief economics correspondent. Scott, good morning.
If the U.S. were running a deficit and interest rates rose, the government could buy back its debt at discount prices, he said. But then it would have to issue more debt at a higher interest rate to fund the buyback, which would be a wash.
The AMT was passed into law in 1969, amid public outrage over reports that some 155 ultrawealthy people had escaped paying federal taxes altogether by using loopholes and tax shelters, says Leonard E. Burman, director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

PARKER: No, I think it's - I don't think it's - I don't think people are very interested in arguing about that right now. I think they're much more concerned about, you know, who's going to be the president than they are about who's going to which bathroom. It's not...
Individuals earning up to $75,000 and couples earning up to $150,000 would receive the full direct payments of $1,400 per person. But those payments would phase out for individuals and couples who make more than $80,000 and $160,000, respectively.
Mayor Ras Baraka says the new cameras replace the old system that was wiped out during Hurricane Sandy. He says these cameras are different: These cameras are going to be watched, and, Baraka hopes, not only by the Newark Police Department. We're also recruiting our neighborhood and our residents to participate and engage with us, he says.
So was President Trump in the know about all that was unfolding in Ukraine? Lev Parnas says yes. The Soviet-born businessman is a key figure in the impeachment case against the president.
ERICKSON: We formed a cooperative, and the subscribers to our network are the owners. So let me give you an example. To build a fiber-optic network and connect people in towns, the cost per home or per business is about $2,500. To build that network and connect the farms, it's about $10,000, about the cost of a used pickup.
But when they went in, the room was empty.
Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris, who's a candidate for the 2020 presidential election, has endorsed Medicare for all. But the details of what that means are rather elusive.
Trump invited Iain Lanphier, an eighth-grader who he said aspired to join the newly created Space Force. He quoted Iain, who said, Most people look up at space. I want to look down on the world.
I believe that every employee, from the CEO suite to the factory floor, contributes to a business' success, so everybody should share in the rewards – especially those putting in long hours for little pay.
That process, which includes an anti-trust review by the U.S. Department of Justice, typically takes about two months. But the Trump administration is expected to rush to issue the leases formally before the president leaves office in two weeks.
Some states have sought to fill the gaps and, so far, eight states — California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington — along with the District of Columbia have established paid family leave programs, funded through payroll taxes. For a while, at least, Colorado looked poised to join them.
GREENE: Why do you predict that?
Maniac is a fascinating book by an author who shows real mastery of the true-crime genre. The story Schechter recounts is a difficult one to read, but the author's intelligence and sensitivity make it one that's well worth your time.
Because of the lockdown, we were forced to come up with this creative work-around. We started selling to our friends and neighbors, first by word of mouth, and then online, Shalke, 21, explains. We couldn't just sit at home and let our grapes rot. We had to take the initiative.
PARKER: I would say zero chance of that happening. It's just not going - I don't think it's going to happen. They don't - by splitting the ticket or by bringing in a third-party candidate, they're essentially assuring that Hillary Clinton becomes the candidate - becomes the president. And who's going to volunteer for that job? They talk about people like Ben Sasse, who is somebody - you know, he's clearly a rising star and someone to watch...
Barb Carson, the Deputy Associate Administrator for the Office of Disaster Assistance at the SBA, says she agency has never handled a project like SVOG before.
According to Jesse Jenkins, a postdoctoral environmental fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School, that may be an unreachable goal.
For example, guaranteeing equal pay won't just increase paychecks for women – it will boost family budgets and get incomes rising across the board. Yet for some reason, Trump's against it.
Inside State Republicans' Fight To Make It More Difficult To Vote
The White House said there are no hard feelings.
I think they really need to re-look at the name [of the bill] and add the missing component of the worker, says Carl Pasciuto, president of Custom Group, a high tech manufacturing company in Woburn, Mass.
Craft breweries might be about to crack open a celebratory cold one.
ELVING: An extraordinary performance in front of the House Judiciary Committee one day, followed by a truly stunning one in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee the next. The attorney general said spying occurred on the Trump campaign in 2016, but offered no indication of why he thought so or who might have done it and then said it was possible there was reason for surveillance, but he hadn't gotten all the information yet. So Barr is supposed to be the steady hand here. He's a veteran. He's been attorney general before. So it was amazing to hear him make such statements without having that information.
As president, I will also make a major push to empower small businesses and entrepreneurs.
Other compromises allow future homeowners to deduct the interest on mortgages of up to $750,000, down from $1 million under current law. The House bill would have set a lower cap of $500,000 and excluded mortgages on second homes. Families will also be allowed to deduct up to $10,000 of state and local taxes, including property tax and a choice of either sales or income tax.
Erik Rettig, an expert on family leave policies at the Small Business Majority, which advocates for those firms on national policy, says a tax credit, claimed at the end of the year, is unlikely to encourage small businesses to offer paid family and medical leave.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I will soon be taking emergency action, which is unprecedented, to provide financial relief. This will be targeted for workers who are ill, quarantined or caring for others due to coronavirus.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Senator Bernie Sanders is an independent from Vermont. He's also running for the Democratic nomination. Thank you so much.
States want to revote. The states got defrauded. They were given false information. They voted on it. Now they want to recertify. They want it back. All Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify and we become president and you are the happiest people.

Obamacare relies on the mandate to make sure it isn't just the sick and people at high risk of getting sick who buy coverage, driving up insurance costs.
Flake's outspoken criticism of Trump has earned plenty of jabs back from Trump, despite the fact that the president still needs his vote to pass his tax overhaul.
SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.
DONOVAN: I think, Mary Louise, that to get to some of the other items, we've been told that you have to do health care first. There's tax ramifications and any kind of repeal of the Affordable Care Act - eliminating the individual mandate and that employer mandate that's going to have tax implications, so you have to do health care before you get to tax reform.
Speaking to reporters this morning, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that even though you're not seeing a lot of evidence yet in the government's statistics of economic fallout, you are starting to hear anecdotal stories from people whose businesses are feeling the ill effects.

Nogales, Ariz., is the No. 1 port of entry for Mexican produce coming into the U.S.: A whopping 6.3 billion pounds of fresh produce crossed the border there during the 2015-16 season. That's more than 19 pounds per American consumer.
R. SHAHIN: I mean, in my family, the whole idea that in a community there was, you know - the respect was for clergy and then teachers, you know? It's just like there. And I don't think - for teachers, especially - that respect just doesn't seem to be extended by policymakers.
Yeah, it's simple for them. They just get the simple maximum $2,000 tax credit. For lower-income people it's more complicated because there's a formula that phases in with their income. So essentially once a low-income person passes a threshold of income of $2,500, the child tax credit phases in at 15 cents on the dollar.
The issue of reparations is one that Democratic candidates have embraced so far this cycle, generally pitching policies that aim to address economic inequality. In this interview, though, Harris emphasizes a disparity in health outcomes that she attributes to environmental rather than genetic factors.
BRUSUELAS: You got what I would refer to as a growing uncertainty tax, which will show up in less hiring and less business investment.

The American Petroleum Institute of Pennsylvania, an affiliate of the national trade group, defended the impact fee and reiterated its opposition to other possible ways of taxing the gas industry.
Carson, who is also black, on Wednesday reaffirmed his support for some of the president's remarks about Baltimore. He said that while he was a practicing physician in Baltimore, he was often caught in a dilemma, over whether to send some children back to their homes in poor neighborhoods in East or West Baltimore.
About a quarter of Arizona's teaching positions are unfilled, and more than half of working teachers don't hold teaching certificates. Educators are skeptical of the governor's plans for a fix.
You know, it's kind of remarkable we don't have - you know, it takes a while to get really good statistics on insurance coverage. It doesn't - it looks like the number of people without insurance has not dramatically increased, which is pretty remarkable given the number of people who have lost their jobs. So that's a pretty clear sign that the Affordable Care Act is doing its job. There's a lot more to be done. But it's working, you know, like it's supposed to work.
While we have only treated 10 confirmed COVID-19 inpatients across our more than 7,000 beds nationwide to date, we are prepared for an influx, the company says.

At times I've wished that I lived in Canada or somewhere else providing better support to its citizens, but I'm still thankful to live in the USA, she said.
INSKEEP: OK. You talked about speaking to the working class. I want people to be aware, if they're not, that on trade, you have sounded in some ways a little like President Trump. You're from an industrial state. You've been critical of NAFTA. I understand that. But do you think that Democrats are ready for anybody who has anything in common with President Trump?
The Senate parliamentarian, a critical but often low-profile arbiter of the chamber's procedural actions, is the subject of frustration from some liberals after a crucial blow to Democrats' agenda late Thursday.

KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: I'm going to fight for other people's kids as hard as I would fight for my own, which is why I believe that health care should be a right and not a privilege.
GREENE: That's right. He's going to be joined by China's vice premier and over 200 invited guests for a signing ceremony at the White House. Trump, who touted the trade deal as a big, beautiful monster at a rally last week, has agreed to relax some of the tariffs he imposed on Chinese imports. And in exchange, Beijing would buy more American products and also make some other changes. But will China follow through on its commitments here?
Lightfoot's inauguration caps a stunning political rise for someone who has never before held elected office. The former federal prosecutor and corporate lawyer launched her mayoral bid last May, months before Mayor Rahm Emanuel's bombshell announcement that he would not seek a third term in office.
HOULAHAN: Yeah, and so I have a very similar answer to that. I answered that question yesterday. It's interesting that I only get that question from the press or from media or, you know, from people in Washington, D.C. Again, it's something that doesn't really come up in our community at all. It's something - when we talk about things in our community, it's jobs. It's education. It's making sure that we have affordable health care. And those kinds of decisions, you know, that are sort of inside baseball are not necessarily something that I'm asked on the regular in our community.
And while Americans have a sour view of Trump, their opinion of Congress — both Democrats and Republicans — is no better. Congressional Republicans have a 33-point net-negative approval rating (28 percent to 61 percent) while congressional Democrats are not much better with a 27-point net-negative approval (30 percent to 57 percent).
Earler on Wednesday Schumer sent a letter to the president along with more than 30 Senate Democrats appealing for quick action.

I would say we're in the middle of a very significant impact, some would say devastating impact, to the airline industry, Hayes said. There were lots of concerns just after 9/11 about flying. And we're really seeing the same now with the coronavirus.
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren calls for a $500 billion federal investment over the next 10 years in new affordable housing. She says her plan would create 3 million new units and lower rents by 10%. Warren would also give grants to first-time homebuyers who live in areas where black families were once excluded from getting home loans. Everybody who lives or lived in a formerly red-lined district can get some housing assistance now to be able to buy a home, Warren told attendees at the She the People Presidential Forum in Houston this spring.
Dr. Douglas Bettcher, director of the WHO's Department for the Prevention of Noncommunicable Diseases, says that consumption of free sugars, including products like sugary drinks, is a major factor in the global increase of people suffering from obesity and diabetes.
Bullies may lend a punch, they may leave a mark, but they have never, not once, in the history of our United States, managed to match the strength and spirit of the people united in defense of their future, Kennedy said.

No need to worry about the animals — they are still being cared for and fed. Still, the switched-off cams are upsetting fans who turn to them for stress relief.
Patterson, who died in 2013, replied that the newspaper had indeed reported despite pressure to look away — but there were limits to the paper's influence. Despite the paper's intense scrutiny of Lester Maddox, the combative segregationist was elected Georgia's governor in 1966. The paper also covered his occasionally surprising policies. As The New York Times later noted, Maddox surprised many by hiring and promoting blacks in state government and by initiating an early release program for the state prison system.
MCCAIN: Well, first, I got to mention about my character being formed by being in prison. I don't think my character was formed in prison. I think it was formed before that. But what I think it made me realize, very frankly, in prison that I was dependent on others. It was my friends and comrades that picked me up when I was down and literally saved my life. And I mean, I always thought that I would be able to do everything for myself, and I found that I was very much dependent upon my comrades, who were my source of strength, and in a couple of cases, a couple of guys that took care of me when I was first prisoner, and they literally saved my life.
ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Well, I'm happy to be with you, Scott.

Forty percent of all teachers. That's more than a million educators, in Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Rhode Island and Texas.
The idea is essentially an experiment in basic income for families. Democrats have said the bill is aimed at helping people who have been harmed the most in the pandemic because they were already in dire financial circumstances or at risk of falling behind even in a healthy economy.
On Monday, the same day House Democrats also introduced resolution that will lay the groundwork for going through a reconciliation process.
Trump suggested he is not worried that China will relax pressure on Pyongyang, despite the trade dispute.
I feel totally betrayed, Haley says.
BASS: I think he has demonstrated that he is a racist, and he's demonstrated that over many decades, going back to when he was a young man in the housing discrimination lawsuits. But I will tell you something. It's way more significant to me. His policies are far more significant, and he demonstrated that on the first few days of his presidency.
DAVIES: If we're going to see big tax cuts and he still wants to spend a lot on rebuilding the military and some other areas, the wall and immigration enforcement, what's the fiscal impact in a world in which deficits are a serious concern?

In the loss, we saw how much there was to gain, Biden said. Finding light in the darkness is a very American thing to do. It may be the most American thing we do.
It was last March, remember, when a senior House Democrat called this disaster 'a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision,'  McConnell said on the Senate floor. Americans are suffering, but their side sees an opportunity to ram through ideological change.
You might want to check your bank account this weekend.
So, for example, the hashtag #redfored was used widely last year and also picked up this year in Denver and LA. And the scholars that I've been talking to, if you take a step back, they've noted that overwhelmingly, you know, teachers in America, they are educated. They are overwhelmingly women. They skew a bit older.
Trump has also promised to allow tax deductions for child care and elder care and to create tax-free dependent care savings accounts, with matching contributions for low-income families. As we reported earlier this year, that would cost the government $25 billion annually.
Democrats were under pressure to get the bill to Biden's desk before current federal unemployment benefits expire on March 14.
Soros declined to be interviewed for this story, but Patrick Gaspard, who is the president of Open Society Foundations, rejected the Hungarian government allegations. He said the work his boss has done for the past 30 years is strictly limited to building up civil society and democracy.
KAMALA HARRIS: I am running for president of the United States.
ORDOÑEZ: Yes. This was the second day that Dr. Fauci was not at the briefing. So in times like this, people get very curious and very quickly. The vice president's spokesperson, Katie Miller, did come out, though, and said that Dr. Fauci has several media hits scheduled today, but that he would be back at the briefing tomorrow.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is calling for any new aid package to meet three criteria: assist individuals and families with financial challenges, secure the country's economy and economic foundation, and ready the health care system and support medical professionals.
Johnson & Johnson has gotten a lot of praise for its single-dose COVID-19 vaccine approved by the FDA last weekend. But as it works to end the pandemic, Johnson & Johnson is also among four of America's biggest health care companies that are negotiating a settlement for their role in the nation's deadly opioid crisis. Tens of billions of dollars are at stake, but the companies are also planning to use corporate tax breaks, including a new one created during the pandemic, to offset those opioid payouts. Some members of Congress are furious about this.
TANKERSLEY: Well, it's always unpopular to go after deductions. This is the thing about the tax code. Everyone wants it to be more efficient and simpler, but you don't want to lose the things that benefit you personally. The argument Republicans are going to make to try to counter that is that it's much simpler - that 90 percent of families now will be able to file their taxes on a postcard because it doubles the standard deduction and they're not going to take itemized deductions anymore. It's going to be easy and hopefully - and for the bulk of American families, I should say, a tax cut. The argument on the Democratic side is going to be, yes, these are very popular things. There's all sorts of stuff getting rid of that people really like. Student loan interest deductions, for example, also are gone here.

From Parking Attendants To Pet Sitters, Tourism Workers Slammed By Pandemic
Nearly all of the states and the District of Columbia that operate their own marketplaces are establishing special enrollment periods similar to the new federal one, though they may have somewhat different time frames or eligibility rules. In Massachusetts, for example, the sign-up window remains open until May 23, while in Connecticut, it closes March 15. Meanwhile, Colorado has reopened enrollment in its marketplace for residents who lack insurance, but most people already enrolled in one of the state's marketplace plans won't be allowed to switch to a different plan until the regular open enrollment period in the fall.

What the administration and Congress must do immediately is stabilize the individual insurance marketplace and not destabilize the employer marketplace, said James Klein, president of the American Benefits Council, which advocates for large companies.
So that's a demonstration, I think, of an important element here, which is that the words of a president are in their own way enormously powerful. You know, we talk about what he could sign, but really even before he signs something, just simply indicating something or saying something off hand can have a powerful effect. I think the best example of that based on the research for this piece was what he could do in Europe. Donald Trump as a candidate talked about the idea that he might not support NATO unconditionally. He was asked if a NATO member, for instance, was attacked, would you come to its defense. And he said I would first check to see if they'd fulfilled their financial obligations.
Dr. POSEN: Two things happened. One is it's always easier to play catch-up among countries than to be at the cutting edge. So all the way up until the mid-'80s, Japan was still doing what in a sense China is doing today, taking people out of its backward sectors, extending the market share of the economy, learning how to make the cutting-edge technologies, working its way up the ladder. And once Japan got to the mid-'80s, it was out the frontier like the U.S. or Germany or Britain, and it couldn't have the fast, fast growth the way it once did.

The problem of improper use of military troop-level incentives isn't limited to California — but the state has emerged as a focal point because of two factors: the large size of its guard force, and a history of overpayments.
Those second-tier diseases include measles and dengue, which did gangbusters in the tropics. Cholera raged in Yemen. Polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat. In Pakistan, polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018. In a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort, a dozen countries that had been polio free (including China, Angola and the Philippines) reported cases of vaccine-derived polio in 2019. Venezuela reported its first yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country's health care system continues its downward spiral. Despite efforts to rein it in, a few cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the Middle East, and that will probably continue in the coming year.
So like many people without insurance, they wait until they're really sick before seeking help. When Blanca developed pneumonia a few years ago, the waiting lists for an appointment at community clinics that would see her without insurance were long. Finally, when she could no longer breathe comfortably, she went to the emergency department.
It's important for us to stand up for truth. I think in this day and age when facts are being attacked, when truth-bearers are being attacked, it is important for us to stand in opposition to that.
While there has been general consensus on key provisions of the package, including small-business loan guarantees and direct cash payments, Democrats want more conditions placed on funds to assist large corporations in order to ensure, for instance, that the money goes to protect workers' jobs and not stock buybacks to benefit shareholders.

Shankar Duraiswamy, from the law firm Covington & Burling, is the lead attorney who represented a group of individuals from states including Maryland and Arizona in the other lawsuit. He noted in a written statement that Hazel's ruling establishes that the question will actually undermine the voting rights of citizens who live in states and communities with significant Latino and immigrant populations.
Investment is a big deal because it gives us more machines and tools and structures that make workers better at their jobs — it increases productivity — and that is key to better wages, economic growth and, ultimately, an improving standard of living.

Since then, while the rest of India has modernized, Indian agriculture has stagnated. Subsidies and rising land prices have allowed a small group of farmers to prosper, but a majority remain poor like Sanap. There's even been an epidemic of farmer suicides in rural India.
NPR's Noel King talks to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, about efforts to stop the spread of the coronavirus in the United States.
KEITH: And that, of course, is a famous line from President Obama's first election campaign. It was his whole theme. Ayesha, what stood out to you from this debate?
HARARI: Well, there are experiments everywhere. Like, my university just moved into all its courses online, which it thought of doing for years but never did anything. And now we have this huge experiment. What happens when you move an entire university online? Similarly, you know, there have been talk about universal basic income for several years. And now the U.S. government is going to do it. What happens when hundreds of millions of people start working from home, instead of going to the office or to the factory? So all these are basically social experiments on a massive scale that will change the world. We can't predict what will happen because the main thing is that we have so many choices. It's not like there is just one predetermined outcome to this epidemic.
GREENE: All right, some important caveats there. NPR Beijing correspondent Emily Feng. Thanks, Emily.

ANDREW CUOMO: This will be a period of disruption for the local community. I understand that. This is a public health decision. And this is literally a matter of life and death.
Now let me tell you again about my background as a prosecutor. That includes having sat down with children who have dealt with the worst of crimes that you can imagine and understanding that you can never prove their cases until you spend a significant amount of time with them, so that they trust you as an adult [whom] they don't know to tell their story, OK? People in Washington were saying, 'Expedite these cases, get them done in two weeks.' For children who — I will never forget the images — who were sitting on a chair, their feet were dangling. That's how small they were. And we were going to expedite these cases to have them tell a perfect stranger in a language or a dialect they don't speak about the trauma that they were experiencing in their home country, which required them to seek refuge in ours. ...

Gun owners can already use suppressors — or silencers — in most states, but gun rights groups say that the process to get one is onerous. Suppressors are regulated under the National Firearms Act, which was originally enacted in 1934 following the St. Valentine's Day Massacre to tax the making and transfer of certain firearms. The underlying purpose of the act, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, was to curtail, if not prohibit, transactions in NFA firearms.
The budget forecast assumes that U.S. economic output recovers to pre-pandemic levels by the middle of this year. The CBO doesn't anticipate that employment will fully recover until 2024.

While the President has the power to reduce Mr. Blagojevich's sentence, the fact remains that the former governor was convicted of very serious crimes.

It's not unusual for signing bonuses to have strings attached. But in the civilian world, conditions for repayment are often limited to cases where an employee spends less than a year in their new job. In the case of the California National Guard, soldiers who say they held up their end of the contract — serving the required three- or six-year re-enlistment period — are being told to repay a key incentive.
HARRIS: Yeah. So that's helpful, yeah.
For Baker, the latest bust feels different though. Wyoming, the least populated state in the US, is on the financial brink, and now the Biden administration is trying to wean the country off fossil fuels due to the climate crisis.

KIM: Well, you know, the fact that these protests took place in so many towns and cities across Russia is hugely significant because, in the past, they've mostly been concentrated in large urban areas. This protest is really national, and there were arrests in dozens of cities, including in the conservative Russian heartland that has traditionally been very loyal to Putin. And, of course, the Kremlin is extremely sensitive about that. And that's why we see so many arrests. They're basically trying to scare people off the streets.

Trump called several foreign leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. He also had a tense call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, though details would not be reported until later in the week. The president told Turnbull it was the worst call by far that he (Trump) had had that day, and the two clashed on the Obama administration's deal to accept refugees from the country.
The restaurant industry is generally regarded as unfriendly to women, whether it's frequent sexual harassment in the workplace or nonexistent family leave policies. In the 21st century, women still struggle to advance within restaurant kitchens and can find it next to impossible to find funding to open their own restaurants.

House Republicans passed their version of a tax bill this week, but there were 13 Republican representatives who voted against the $1.5 trillion overhaul.

I learned that Americans are very patriotic. I learned that Americans want to serve the country. I learned that there is great cynicism out there and even alienation on the part of young people as to whether they are really well-represented anymore in Washington, D.C. And they - although they don't know the specifics of campaign finance reform - most of them never heard of McCain-Feingold - there is a cynicism out there that they are no longer represented in the special interests due. And there's a desire for overall reform - reform the tax code, reform of education, reform of the military, reform of health care. And if properly called, Americans will respond in - I believe in a most patriotic fashion.

The Trump administration sold the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as a solution to the problem of lackluster investment. In our first Planet Money newsletter, we interviewed Kevin Hassett, who was then one of Trump's chief economic advisers. He argued that cutting the tax rate on corporations would result in an investment boom. But, as the Fed acknowledged in a statement justifying its actions last week, the growth of investment over the past year has been soft.

For many news organizations, journalism is commerce as well as public service. TV networks pushed for more primary debates because they could make money off those evenings. CNN made great riches by airing Trump at great unedited length on the campaign trail during the primaries: It booked an extra $100 million above what it would expect for an election year, attributed to the obsessive focus on Trump. CNN chief Jeff Zucker even boasted that the network's ad inventory for election night was sold out in record time. Along the way, CNN, Fox News, NBC and other outlets yielded to all kinds of demands by Trump. As one example, Trump's near-insistence on doing interviews by phone ensured he could control the tempo of the exchanges. As a man who prizes negotiation, Trump knew such demands would cement his alpha-dog status.

BEYER: Well, I'm incredibly sympathetic to that. But I think rule number one is we shouldn't be making the decision on impeachment based on the political consequences. That's just too cynical and too profane. We should be making this on the basis of, what's the right thing to do? What's the legal thing to do? - the constitutional thing. And I also - I don't know that this is true. But I hope that those - my wonderful colleagues in swing seats, even seats that Trump won in 2016, will be bolstered by the fact that we are trying to do the right thing for the country. They shouldn't have to apologize for a president who's - documented - lied 10,000 times already to the American people.

HORSLEY: Good question. You know, and the chairman acknowledged that it's really up to health care providers who bear the real responsibility for addressing this outbreak. And the kind of medicine the Fed can offer may not be exactly what the economic doctor ordered.

Nevertheless, Chairman Powell thinks this will have a positive effect.

FAUCI: Yes. That had not been the case just a while ago, but that has been corrected. So right now there are about at least 1.1 million tests that are out there. I believe another 640,000 have been shipped yesterday. And then by the end of the week and into next week, there should be about 4 million tests. So you're correct. Earlier on, because of some missteps that have been corrected, they were not allowed out there, but now that has been corrected. And I believe as we look forward, we'll see a pretty good availability of tests.
Another member suggested that the Reddit traders were part of a resistance movement of sorts, writing, [T]his is not a war on billionaires, the wealthy yada yada, but it may well be described as a resistance against injustice, inequality, rigged rules, uneven playing field etc which has been rampant on Wall Street forever.
MCEVERS: So let's start with that news that we mentioned about the Trump Foundation. Give us some more details about what New York's attorney general is doing.

The anonymous source behind the Panama Papers document dump has offered to help law enforcement officials pursue wrongdoers, in exchange for immunity from prosecution.
We are working closely with the IRS to provide the payments in a way that they may be properly applied to an inmate's trust account, said Alia Cruz, a spokesperson for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.
To try to make it easier to pay those salaries, as well to encourage people to buy domestically instead of relying on imports, the government devalued the dinar against the dollar by about 20% in December. But as Iraq produces very little, people have little choice but to buy imported goods — which are only more expensive now.
MARTIN: And just today, House Speaker John Boehner said that he is, quote-unquote, hopeful about bringing up immigration reform in the House this year. We wanted to talk more about this, if there really is the political and popular well to address this country's immigration laws. So we've called upon somebody who's been following the issue closely. Fernando Espuelas is the managing editor and host of The Fernando Espuelas Show, which is broadcast on Univision America. Welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us once again.

A former state monopoly, France Telecom was privatized in 1998 and now competes on the world market. It has undergone several major reorganizations in recent years and cut 22,000 jobs in the past two years. But company officials say those were voluntary departures and that the firm is the only telecom giant not to have carried out mass layoffs
In your case, you'll file federal form 8965 with your tax return to report a short-term insurance coverage gap and claim an exemption from the coverage requirement. Your employer — or your insurer, if you purchased coverage on your own — will send a form to the IRS stating that you were covered for the other 11 months, Straw says.
When we abandoned the policy of America First, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own. The skyscrapers went up in Beijing and many other cities in the world while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled right here in Detroit. Our roads and bridges fell into disrepair. Yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expense. Today, Detroit has per capita income of under $15K - about half of the national average.

SAGAL: No. She might've. But in this instance, we were asking about somebody forgetting a headstone reading, you will never be forgotten.
BOWMAN: Well, it was about a year ago - actually, March 23 - that ISIS suffered a resounding defeat. The final village was taken at the hands of these U.S.-backed forces. But ISIS fighters, Rachel, are seeping back into the cities and villages, mounting assassinations against officials, planting bombs and intimidating residents. So the U.S. forces here continue to work with the Kurds to go after them.

CLINTON: Some of his supporters said, well, it just shows he's a genius...
MARTIN: You can see that he's got a lot of pressure from the left. I mean, there were demonstrations at his house asking - you know, basically telling him to, you know, hold the line against the Republicans. This was kind of early in the Trump era because he and former President Trump, you know, obviously knew each other from New York circles and so forth. You know, on the other hand, you know, he - I think that he's attributed his own success in politics to kind of keeping his finger on the pulse of, you know, the middle class. He's kind of put his finger on, you know, bread-and-butter issues like - college tuition was one of his issues earlier in his career - right? - you know, tax credits for college tuition. But it seems as though, you know, the left wants more. And it is a 50-50 Senate. It's a - so I'm just wondering, do you have a sense of how he feels he's going to thread that needle?
I could see that Gilead would like that, Kaitin said of the orphan drug tax breaks and promise of seven years without generic competitors. But at the same time, it's hard to imagine the FDA would say, OK, we're going to call it an orphan drug even though it's not [rare.]' 
In an op-ed in Wednesday's Washington Post, Romney said, Trump's words and actions have caused dismay around the world.
One simple tip: if you find yourself starting to say I think, pause. Frame your answers around what your reporting tells you, what polls are saying or what history shows is likely to happen.
BROOKS: Well, you know, I don't know if there's a there there. Never underestimate the possibility for Washington people to have pointless meetings. And it could be Jeff Sessions had a pointless meeting with Cislyak (ph) the Russian ambassador - or Kislyak. And it could've just been one of those get-togethers that happens all the time. On the other hand, there are so many points of contact between Trump - various Trump persona and the Russians that it's like a Seurat painting - the points are beginning to look like something.

When you look at Trump's tax proposals, how closely do they match your ideas of what a tax plan should be?
In the excerpt, Clinton describes herself now as being far-removed from the struggles of middle class life and acknowledges a growing sense of anxiety and even anger in the country over the feeling that the game is rigged. She does say that she had a solid middle class upbringing that she hasn't forgotten.
SANDERS: Well (laughter), let me tell you something. When I started 60 or 70 points behind Secretary Clinton, how was that? Was that a pretty steep hill to climb? Yesterday, some observers said that we pulled off one of the biggest political upsets in the history of American politics, so stay tuned. I think we are going to go further, and we have a good chance to pull off the biggest political upset in the modern history of America. We can win this thing. We've got a path towards victory. I think we have the momentum. We're looking forward to a victory.
Democrats chose Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to give the English response to the State of the Union Address. But in Michigan, some wonder if she can live up to expectations.
President Biden invited a group of Senate Republicans to the White House today to talk COVID relief. You'll remember, in its final days, the last Congress approved a COVID relief measure, but that money is running out quickly, and Biden promised to do more right away. He wants $1.9 trillion for people, businesses and schools. A group of Republican senators has sent him their counteroffer, and they want to spend much less. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith is following this one. Good morning, Tam.
I can maybe, with my engineering background and with a little help from some folks, be able to build a tool that works when I'm actually standing in line at the grocery store with, you know, 3-year-old kids screaming up and down the aisles and be able to make the right kind of decisions that I need to make, because this thing has done a lot of that sit-down-at-the-desk thinking for me and can prompt me to do the right things.
A group of Republican senators met with President Biden on Monday evening to detail a smaller counterproposal to his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, an alternative they believe could be approved quickly by Congress with bipartisan support.
Brazil, Peru and Chile are all reporting hundreds of coronavirus cases, as South American governments tighten restrictions on public life to slow down the spread of the deadly COVID-19 respiratory disease. The continent now has more than 940 cases.

Writing for the dissenters, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that using lethal force against a person who poses no immediate threat to the officer and no threat to others surely qualifies as an unreasonable invasion of an individual's constitutional rights. It should not matter one whit that the boy was standing on the Mexican side of the embankment, not the U.S. side, she added.

They're experiencing the mental stress of not being able to plan or see a life passed having a student loan debt, Bishop says. So the $10,000 doesn't really get at that kind of reality and burden.
Whaling, who is president of the PR firm, says Geben already provides up to 10 weeks of paid leave at full pay for new parents. So far, four employees have taken leave; by divvying up their work to other team members and hiring freelance help, the firm has been able to get by.
WESSEL: Right. Well, we know what the headlines are going to be. We don't know the details. We don't know what the state of Indiana - where Mike Pence, the vice-president elect is the governor - has promised in return. It's hard for me to believe that President Trump is going to be able to shame or negotiate every plant that threatens to close. There's another one in Indianapolis that's moving to Mexico, a bearing plant called Rexnord - 300 jobs. Is he going to intervene there, too?
She added that Clinton is far from being a perfect candidate, but compared with Trump, it's an easy decision for her.
After World War II, Germany put in place a financial and institutional structure that supported manufacturing, but the economy's emphasis on making things goes back much further to a tradition of very capable small and middle-size companies called the Mittelstand. In Germany, they are seen as the foundation of the country's manufacturing success.
Ms. TUCKER: Sorry to disagree with Lenny here, because I don't think that Tea Partiers are that overly motivated by expansive government. If so, I would think that they would have been a lot more unhappy with the Bush administration. We didn't see a Tea Party movement start then.
OSNOS: The president has broad authority on trade. So, for instance, right away, the president could end American participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I think it's fair to assume that the TPP as it's known is now dead. But beyond that, he could also force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from it eventually.
I don't know why there's not complaints about that, she adds. I don't know why somebody doesn't say to some senator or another, 'Well how come you're not making better laws for what gets disclosed on these [returns]?' And the reason should be rather obvious.
SIMON: Jason Furman, who is former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration, thanks so much for being with us.
He also said he's going to be holding a major press conference on December 15 to provide details about what he's going to do. That's kind of a long way off. I'm not sure why he's waiting that long except maybe because his lawyers need more time just to figure out how to address these issues.
Biden has made confronting the coronavirus the top priority for his administration — and according to a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, a majority of Americans approve of how he has handled the pandemic so far. That includes 30% of Republicans and 22% of Trump supporters surveyed.
But I can't do these things on my own. Changes in our political process – in not just who gets elected but how they get elected – that will only happen when the American people demand it. It will depend on you. That's what's meant by a government of, by, and for the people.
Biden will now ask lawmakers to spend heavily on measures designed to cushion the economic fallout from the pandemic, including expanded unemployment benefits and additional direct payments to most Americans.
KELLY: Scott Horsley, you start. What does the administration want to do with all this money - $1 trillion?
Indeed, restaurants are typically known for long work days, often 12 or 14 hours. But the female restaurateurs profiled in the film see no reason why restaurants can't be structured to allow for work-life balance.
To help pay for such projects, the government is planning to sell a 5 percent stake in Saudi Aramco, the giant oil company. It is being touted as one of the world's biggest initial public offerings. Mohammed al-Tuwaijri, the minister of economy and planning, says that sale will provide a huge injection of cash to the kingdom.
The story of the Bath School massacre is a difficult one to tell, and not just because of the enormity of Kehoe's murders. Two days after the disaster, Charles Lindbergh made his famous trans-Atlantic flight aboard the Spirit of St. Louis, and the publicity around the voyage pushed the Bath bombing out of the headlines. But Schechter has managed to do a wonderful job researching the subject, drawing from newspaper reports, books and public records, and he synthesizes them beautifully, creating a tight narrative that's hard to put down.
It's not about hauling people into court and getting them to pay these fines, he says. It's about negotiating the settlement so the person actually licenses the work the way they should've.
This is to meet the needs of nuclear power plants, said John Quigley, director of Harrisburg University's Center for Environment, Energy and Economy. It's important to preserve all of Pennsylvania's zero-carbon energy, at least in the short term, until renewable energy scales up, which will take time. We should be increasing the tier 1 renewable energy requirements. We need a much bigger solar share — we should be looking at 15 percent.

Although I support the Senate's effort to reduce the number of wealthier households that will receive stimulus checks, they did not go far enough, and other changes — like removing the minimum wage increase or providing a lower unemployment benefit — undermined policies that I support, Golden said in a statement.
Yes, there's some energy for it on the left — some House Democrats have already said they will support the bill. However, there are indications House leadership isn't prioritizing the idea as much as those more liberal Democrats would like — Speaker Nancy Pelosi frustrated Green New Deal proponents by not giving them the kind of committee they wanted to put the policies together.
Unsurprisingly, impeachment is a nonstarter with 84 percent of GOP voters. And Lee Miringoff, the director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, said arguing to voters that Democrats would try to stymie Trump and remove him from office could be one of the most salient messages for Republicans this fall, especially given Trump's low approval ratings and rising frustrations with Congress.

Democrats have to feel buoyed by surveys in recent days that show the American people overwhelmingly support the legislation. A Quinnipiac poll out this week showed two-thirds supported the relief package, nearly 8 in 10 supported the $1,400 checks, and even 6 in 10 supported raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Though Biden told CBS News he doesn't think the minimum wage hike will make it into the package in the end.

At first glance, the scene probably looked familiar to many people in Phoenix: tens of thousands massing outside Chase Field on a bright Thursday afternoon in April, clad in red and rippling with anticipation. But that scene, if it were typical, would feature fans of the Arizona Diamondbacks — not the teachers who gathered near the baseball stadium with quite another event in mind.
That really eroded my confidence, and certainly some [other people's], in GSA's ability to be objective about this president, Connolly says.

Connor wrote an analysis that found Warren's pitch is both lawful and permissible.
SNELL: Well, I think the two biggest items for individuals and families are the direct checks and unemployment insurance. Start with the checks that we've talked about many times in - on our programming - are the $1,200 checks to people earning $75,000 or less. And it would be double the amount - so $2,400 - for married couples and $500 for families with children, so $500 per child. Now, those will be largely direct deposits if the IRS has your information on file, and if it does, that money could go out within the next couple of weeks.

However, some people of limited means have also seen their taxes rise.
In making his closing argument for tax legislation expected to get a vote in Congress next week, President Trump announced that the changes would take effect early next year.
MATTHEWS: It's been a disaster, I think, for the country. But it has also fueled more candidates - and going back to your earlier question - more candidates than ever before on the Democratic side, including more minorities and women to run for office because they are motivated to step in there and actually take their government back.
If you look at Matt Gaetz going to Wyoming, because — what — a tough woman has an independent view and he doesn't want to go out and explain why he didn't vote for impeachment? Kinzinger told NBC's Chuck Todd. That's totally GOP cancel culture!
The American tax code is very complicated, but the IRS counts on all of us to interpret it for ourselves and mail in a check if we owe something. Every year, thousands of American try to abuse this system to avoid paying their share. Heath Romer from our Planet Money team brings us the story of what happened when one man took this idea as far as he could.
As Secretary of State, I fought hard for American businesses to get a fair shot around the world and to stop underhanded trading practices like currency manipulation and theft of intellectual property.
ROVNER: That's right. That's the biggest concern that insurers have. Insurance - said when the Affordable Care Act was passed, that if you're going to require us to accept sick people and not to charge them more, you're going to have to have some way to get more healthy people into the pool. That's what this mandate penalty was about. Insurers said at the beginning it wasn't big enough. And, in fact, it hasn't really driven that many healthy people to sign up. But there is a concern that if you take it away and don't replace it with anything - and at the moment there is no replacement in this bill - that literally only sick people will buy insurance. The only response for insurers at that point is either to raise premiums dramatically or to drop out altogether.

YDSTIE: Well, the U.S. unemployment rate is down to just over 4 percent, very close to full employment. So Walmart needs to raise wages just to attract and hang onto employees. And there's evidence that that helps. Walmart boosted wages and training back in 2015. And according to the analysts, that helped them increase same-store sales continuously since then.

TUBBS: It doesn't cost tax payers anything. It's paid from $1.2 million in philanthropic funding. So the idea is that in the next couple of years, we'll have some data that will tell us whether this is a solution that is viable or not.
DAVIES: And what kind of tax cuts are we talking about? I mean, for those of us who haven't carefully followed his campaign positions, are they upper income, middle income, everybody?
For too long, big promises about the power of training and retraining haven't delivered like they should. It doesn't help anyone to be trained for a job that doesn't exist.

While the former workers say Bloomberg's campaign promised them continued employment, they acknowledge they signed at-will contracts, meaning they could be let go at any time.
At the time, politicians argued that benefits should be tied to work, out of fear that a regular cash allowance might keep people out of the workforce, lowering overall economic growth.

The bill would sharply reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent, potentially boosting jobs and wages. The measure also temporarily reduces individual tax rates, doubles the standard deduction and offers a reduced tax for so-called pass-through businesses such as partnerships.
When you've done it for 28 years ago, it's your passion. It's what's in your heart. It's your desire, said Jensen, 56, a father of three from Pontiac, Ill. And to see the opportunity — to see this plant producing cars out the back door again, I was all in.
CARY: I think a growing economy will solve a lot of problems in this country. And tax reform would certainly start the economic engine moving very quickly. You saw it this week with the stock market. I think tremendous good can come from that. It'd solve a lot of problems.
Trump signed an executive order blocking travelers from seven countries, all of which are Muslim-majority — Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia — from entering the U.S. for 90 days. New refugee admissions are suspended for 120 days, while Syrian refugees are banned indefinitely. There was confusion at airports whether or not the ban includes those with valid U.S. visas, green cards or people from those countries who are permanent residents. Protests began at airports as travelers were detained.
But there was plenty of other spending in the bill: more than $200 billion in tax cuts for individuals, for example, and more than $120 billion in education and job training-related programs, according to the Times' tally. There were also $48 billion in transportation projects, along with another $32 billion in other infrastructure projects.

CARY: Every president in his or - his - well, I should say his or her. Every president in their first year has an unexpected crisis, whether it's national security, a natural disaster, domestic unrest. This is certainly shaping up to be Donald Trump's unexpected crisis. And I think he realizes that. And the stakes are getting higher, and I think that's why he's lashing out more because I think he realizes what's going on.
News organizations can yield to mass distraction, and coverage can bounce giddily once again from one outrage and astonishing turn of events to another. It is a time for humility and taking stock.

They are certainly more optimistic than most independent forecasters are right now. And even with those relatively rosy expectations, they are projecting trillion-dollar deficits in each of the next four years. But as Mr. Hassett says, they have nailed their forecasts for the first two years of the Trump administration. We'll see where they go from here.
He intentionally ran up huge amounts of debt on his companies — hundreds of millions of dollars. He borrowed at high interest rates — even after promising regulators that he wouldn't. What came next? He defaulted on those loans. Didn't pay them back. And in the end, he bankrupted his companies — not once, not twice, but four times.
Martinez acknowledged it will be difficult getting in touch with everyone who might qualify for the process and said that some people who qualify might still have some other requirements — like owing money for restitution — that could still prevent them from being eligible to vote.
SANDERS: Well, we have in this campaign, and of course we will continue to do it. We did focus on it in 2016. We will focus on it more.
Slaughter suggests the safety net could be strengthened with expanded unemployment insurance, job training, and direct subsidies for workers whose wages suffer. He warns that unless the benefits of trade are shared more equitably, public opposition to trade deals is likely to grow.
ROVNER: That's right. The law allows insurance companies in these new marketplaces, the exchanges, to charge higher premiums for people who smoke - up to one and a half times the premiums that nonsmokers will be paying. But some insurers had wanted to charge younger smokers a smaller surcharge, if you will, than older smokers. Maybe one and a quarter times instead of one and a half times, since they've been smoking less long and are likely to be healthier overall.
ARS: Do you believe that we in terms of the United States need to pay 100 cents on the dollar? Or do you think there's actually ways that we could renegotiate that debt? DT: I think, look. I've borrowed knowing that you can pay back with discounts. And I've done very well with debt. Now of course I was swashbuckling, and it did well for me, and it was good for me and all of that. And you know debt was always sort of interesting to me. Now we're in a different situation with a country, but I would borrow knowing that if the economy crashed you could make a deal. And if the economy was good it was good so therefore you can't lose. It's like you make a deal before you go into a poker game. And your odds are much better.
Louisiana's ban on casino campaign contributions stems — in part — from the state's history of corruption involving gambling and politicians. Back in 2000 Edwin Edwards, a former governor, was convicted of extorting applicants for lucrative riverboat casino licenses. There have been other scandals, too.
After a record economic expansion, companies still don't see a lot of reasons to invest out there. Giving them even more money by cutting their taxes, Bivens says, isn't going to address the real problems the economy faces.
Gary has been my chief economic adviser and did a superb job in driving our agenda, Trump said in a statement. He is a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.
DAVIS: Yes, and there are already actions taken. The Senate has already approved a new rule that mandates sexual harassment training at the start of every Congress. The House is likely to follow suit. And they're also working on bipartisan legislation that would change the way sexual harassment claims are filed on Capitol Hill. I think if they have more weeks like this one, there's going to be even more pressure to act on legislation like that.

By far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs. What are we doing? Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members. Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved. It will be catastrophic. That is why I have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever ever ever happen.
In San Francisco, 62 percent of voters cast their ballots in favor of the tax on sugary drinks. Similar measures passed in Oakland and Albany, Calif. In addition, the city of Boulder, Colo., passed a 2 cents-per-ounce tax.

The federal conspiracy trial against Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy is hitting right at the heart of the country's divide over information and truth.
That step includes duplicating many of the Census Bureau's efforts, including canvassing neighborhoods for signs of hidden housing and visiting homes to conduct interviews about people's race, sex and other demographic information. Unlike for the U.S. census, however, taking part in California's count is not required by law, and households receive $10 for completing the survey.
But Romney also ruled out a 2020 bid. No, he told CNN's Jake Tapper. You may have heard, I ran before. I've had that experience. I acknowledge the president was successful.
Don't worry about it, Trump assured supporters. Mexico is paying for the wall. With the full understanding that Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall.

Voters can vote for any candidate they want in every race, and the top two finishers advance to November.
Maduro remains in power in Venezuela, and the appearance of Guaidó comes as he attempts to increase pressure on the authoritarian government in the country to relinquish power.
The COVID-19 pandemic is harming the wind industry's ability to build the wind farms envisioned by Congressional legislation and putting at risk 35,000 wind energy jobs, says Tom Kiernan, Chief Executive Officer of AWEA.
HORSLEY: The president was pressed about that. He was asked if a trained sheriff's deputy didn't stop the Parkland shooter, why would he expect armed teachers to do any better? But the president stood by his idea.

They're out there, those voices. They don't get a lot of attention, nor do they seek it, but they are busy doing the work this country needs doing.
The federal government already offered a limited tax break for parents, but the new law expands that in a number of important ways.
We've always had to be looking out for how our rights are going to be taken away from us as individuals; how our constitutional rights are going to be impinged upon, Brownell says. Now, the ball's going to be in our court.
I hope you can pass the USMCA into law so that we can bring back our manufacturing jobs in even greater numbers, expand American agriculture, protect intellectual property, and ensure that more cars are proudly stamped with our four beautiful words: 'Made in the USA.'

The index finds the overall situation for children appears more favorable in 95 of 175 countries. In 40 other countries, however, conditions appear considerably worse.
Unlike the Georgia district up for grabs next week, the 4th Congressional District in Kansas, which includes Wichita, is one Trump won comfortably by 27 points. But the race has largely flown under the radar, and Republicans worry their base may not show up for GOP nominee Rob Estes, the state treasurer.
By Wednesday evening, a growing chorus was suggesting that the administration should reject Putin's offer out of hand.
Such a measure has occasionally been floated by Republicans since the days of President Ronald Reagan, often under the argument of leveling the field between employer plans and other coverage that the tax code treats far less generously.
Despite all of this, the margin in Georgia is only 11,779 votes.
Phelps is from one of the 80% to 90% of households expected to receive a stimulus payment from the government. And to the delight of many, that money is coming sooner than anticipated.
SWONK: Sure. That's one aspect of what's going on. What we're seeing is, literally, things that can't get out of China at the moment are stopping production here in the United States. In Long Beach where a lot of imports come in, half the longshoremen are actually laid off because the port is a ghost town right now because the parts that are essential to build the things that we sell here, and actual goods coming in from China, are not making it here at this point in time, which is idling plants here in the U.S. and causing layoffs here.
You may not remember that happening (because it didn't). Here's what Trump seems to have been saying and how close to the truth it is.
Progressive groups such as the Daily Kos and Democracy for America have looked to boost Quist, a banjo-playing folk and bluegrass singer who has written his own campaign song. The Democratic nominee, who's making his first run for office, has jabbed at Gianforte for keeping a low profile while Quist has held town halls across the state.
When we were governed by the America First policy, Detroit was absolutely booming. Engineers, builders, laborers, shippers and countless others went to work each day, provided for their families and lived out, totally, lived out the American Dream. But for many living in this city, that dream has long ago vanished.

AP: 'Apprentice' Staff, Contestants Say Trump Demeaned Them
SHAPIRO: What's the end game here? If this is successful, do you imagine a scenario years from now where everyone who lives in Stockton gets this monthly check or where nobody needs it anymore, you graduate out of it? How does that work eventually?
So the sort of classic study on this was by Michael Krukones who, in 1984, tabulated all of the campaign pledges of all of the presidents between Woodrow Wilson and Jimmy Carter, and what he found was that altogether they had accomplished 73 percent of the pledges that they said they would. This has been replicated in other studies all the way up to the present where PolitiFact, which is a nonpartisan fact-checking site, has evaluated the campaign pledges by Barack Obama and found that he has achieved at least 70 percent of them. And I think his opponents would agree with that number in the sense that it has been much to their consternation that he has been able to achieve the things he has.
MCCAIN: My doubts were significant. I read and studied for literally a year everything I could get my hands on about Vietnam. I wanted to know what it was that caused me to spend several years over there. I went all the way back to the French occupation of then-Indochina and all those things. And I learned a lot. And again, I learned that the Vietnamese were to a large degree nationalists, that there was a significant disconnect between what was going on on the ground and what was believed in Washington.
At least one story from outside of Russia did get Putin's attention, however — the release earlier in 2016 of the Panama Papers, which documented a number of offshore companies controlled by Putin's friends.

We are proud that we do more than any other country to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as president of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, my constant concern is for America's children, America's struggling workers, and America's forgotten communities, Trump said.
UEFA has 55 member countries. In announcing the decision to put off the Euro tourney, it said the decision to put off the popular tournament was made not only out of concern for the safety of fans of players, but also to avoid the strain its matches would put on public services and infrastructure. In recent days, Europe has emerged as the epicenter of the pandemic, with tens of thousands of new cases in the past week.
But we're going forward. We'll take care of going forward. We've got to take care of going back. Don't let them talk. OK, well, we promised. I've had a lot of people. Sir, you're at 96% for four years. I said I'm not interested right now. I'm interested in right there.
KELLY: ...Back to this point because I think it's one that is on people's minds. You as an conservative economist, I presume, are not in favor of huge increases in the federal deficit. This plan, even with your tweaked version, would add trillions to the deficit, unless you're tweaking it so radically that it's unrecognizable.
Another day, another delay of a piece of the federal health care law known as Obamacare. The administration is having trouble setting up some of the new computer systems required by the Affordable Care Act. Last week, they announced a year-long delay in the implementation of some of the law's requirements for businesses. Today, it's smokers who are affected. Critics say this is more evidence that the administration is not ready to roll out the law, which takes effect in October.
People cannot, and should not, live in neighborhoods that resemble war zones.

Seema Verma, who's the head of Medicare and Medicaid, announced that video appointments with doctors would be vastly expanded for people on Medicare. States are also encouraged to offer to their Medicaid patients. And the idea is people can link up by Skype and so on. Until now, the service has been primarily available just to people in rural areas, but the Trump administration has expanded it to all Medicare patients to meet this emergency.

Among other changes, 36th Ward Alderman Gilbert Villegas will serve as Lightfoot's floor leader, the first Latino ever to hold that unofficial post.

At least 21 people have been reported dead in Iran, as the regime has moved against the protesters. But it's still unclear what this president wants to do tangibly to effect change.

Now, there is a more pragmatic leader in President Hassan Rouhani than there was in Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. So what would change in Iran actually bring?

The study brings up other questions about how raising the minimum wage might affect mental health, says Tsai. He speculated that suicide attempts, which occur 20 to 30 times for every completed suicide, may also be found to decrease with higher minimum wages. Similarly, higher wages could help parents create more economic stability for their children. This, in turn, makes them less likely to face adverse childhood events, such as intimate partner violence and child abuse, which can harm their physical and mental health as adults.

They're cutting taxes to lure Amazon, while Seattle considers taxing the company more. A week and a half ago, a televised City Council question-and-answer session turned into a free-for-all for the mic.
France Telecom has spent its time breaking up teams and breaking down solidarity, Rollin says. They cultivate individualism and selfishness. So the support you might have found amongst colleagues in difficult times is not there. France Telecom manages its employees like cattle.
Donald Trump has defeated all of the other Republicans who were in the contest while Clinton is still fighting a two-front battle. She is finishing her nomination contest against Bernie Sanders, but she's also running against Donald Trump at the same time. So that's just one factor that could be weighing on her numbers.
KELLY: Kelsey, back to you and Capitol Hill and where Congress is in terms of timing. A trillion dollars is a - is not something you want to rush through. But they're trying to get this done this week. Is that right?
Looks like you'd be ripe for a primary if you don't keep your promise, the president told the group of lawmakers in a closed-door meeting, according to Rep. Blake Farenthold. He did say that, the Texas Republican adds.

[That's true, using median household income data, though he is not measuring from the start of the Obama administration as he is for the other stats here. If he measured from 2008, the drop was $1,656. Measuring from 2000 means measuring from the figure's near-peak. [A broader point about all of these economic statistics: A lot of them have been true, but the question is whether Obama is to blame. Higher poverty, for example, doesn't appear to be Obama's doing, as we wrote in a fact check last year. Moreover, many experts believe a president generally has only very limited ability to affect the economy. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

The bill increases the standard deduction for taxpayers who do not itemize deductions. That amounts to a tax cut for them. But the bill also eliminates deductions taken by many who itemize. Those people may face higher tax bills.
We are watching Wall Street this morning. The Dow opened strong and is up more than 600 points, though the global economy has been shaken because of concerns over coronavirus. The outbreak has roiled the stock market. And then oil entered the mix on Monday when a dispute between Saudi Arabia and Russia caused panic. Yesterday was actually Wall Street's worst day in more than a decade. After the markets closed, President Trump said he is going to ask Congress for help.

The Senate also tightened the caps for direct payments, narrowing who would qualify for them.
Polling shows a tightening race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in head-to-head matchups. Bernie Sanders shows more strength against Trump in such polls, but there are important caveats.
Indeed, this tax plan isn't the Trump campaign's only economic proposal. The Tax Foundation points to Trump's trade policies as an example: If he raises tariffs, it would reduce growth but raise revenue, they write.
LIASSON: He's doing what President Trump wants him to do, which is investigate the investigators. There are now three Justice Department inquiries, and to see if anything inappropriate happened when that counterintelligence investigation of Trump's campaign advisers and their contacts with Russia started.
The Tax Foundation tells NPR that it estimates Trump's plan would add around 0.5 percentage points to economic growth each year.

TUBBS: Again, I would push back a little bit on the characterization as a handout. (Laughter) I would say a hand up or an opportunity. And I would say I think this in concert with many of the other things we're doing will. So just two weeks ago, I announced a $20 million scholarship fund so that every kid who graduates from our larger school district, they get a guaranteed scholarship for four years. We're doing a strategy called Advance Peace to advance our public safety. We have a skills gap report coming out with the University of the Pacific to figure out how do you link people to the jobs that will exist and with the skills to do those jobs.
Johnson said he was pleased with the direction of the talks, but he would not commit to voting for the bill until a final agreement is released.
And that's going to continue to seep down through the public including from our Republican friends, he said. There's a lot of Republicans that came very close, they've got a lot of pressure on them and I still haven't given up on getting their support.
She adds, though, I absolutely and strongly believe there should be serious and swift consequence when one human being kills another human being. ... I am unequivocal in that belief. So let's be very clear about that. There should be justice.

Trump hosted his first foreign leader at the White House — British Prime Minister Theresa May. She pushed for a future trade deal with the U.S. The two held a joint news conference, where May said Trump had reaffirmed his support for NATO — though he has questioned whether the U.S. should be in the alliance in the past.
Pascrell insists he believes committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., will go the full distance to request Trump's returns within two to three months. But all signs from leadership point to a slower, more deliberative process.
The NHS polls better than the queen. U.K. politician Nigel Lawson once said the NHS is the closest thing the English people have to a religion. It featured prominently in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics, with doctors dancing to swing music and hospital beds arranged to spell out the letters N-H-S in aerial views from above.
Earlier this month, Starbucks said it would experiment with a 5-pence paper cup charge in 25 London stores starting in February. The company already offers a discount for customers who use reusable cups, as do other coffee chains.
Clinton spoke at Futuramic Tool & Engineering, an advanced manufacturing facility in Warren, Mich. Clinton has been talking about her jobs plan for weeks now, visiting factories and small business. Her address was meant as a contrast to Trump's dark vision of the state of American manufacturing and focus on coal and steel, industries that have been in steep decline for more than a generation.

DEMBOSKY: But the first off-campus clinic she went to didn't do abortions. The second didn't take her insurance. By the time she could get an appointment at a third clinic, she was already in her second trimester, too late for a medication abortion. She had to have a surgical one.
In 2010, after Blagojevich was removed as governor of Illinois over the corruption scandal, he appeared on Apprentice, where Trump fired Blagojevich before saying, I feel badly for him. He tried, but I feel badly.
Yet that transition has hit a snag. Two counties in the state have enacted drastic restrictions on new wind projects in an attempt to save coal mining jobs, despite protests from landowners who'd like to rent their land to wind energy companies. It's a sign of how difficult that transition can be for communities that depend on coal for jobs and tax revenue. The economic benefits of wind power, even though substantial, often flow to different people.

How Biden's Plan Could Help Reshape The Finances Of American Families
The budget for the National Institutes for Health, or NIH, did include an additional $50 million for pediatric cancer, one-tenth of the proposed $500 million over a decade. That's an increase in funding for pediatric cancer of about 9%. The NIH budget is $39 billion, however, so $50 million represents about one-tenth of 1% of the overall budget. — Richard Harris, Science Desk correspondent
That's because to help pay for more than $1 trillion in tax cuts for U.S. corporations, the House Republican tax plan would raise taxes on grad students in a very big way. These students make very little money to begin with. And many would have to pay about half of their modest student stipends in taxes.
But even he knows it won't be so easy.
So, Rueben says, the relatively small amount of money taken from grad students to pay for other cuts would stymie the country's growth in the future.
Manafort entered his guilty plea to two felony counts during an hourlong hearing in federal court in Washington, D.C. The plea took place three days before he was to face trial on charges related to his lobbying work for Ukraine and alleged witness tampering.

Agustina Paglayan is a political economist who studies how governments around the world choose education policies. She says teacher pay has been comparatively low in the protesting states at least as far back as the 1930s.

A royal trial is underway on the Spanish island of Mallorca. Spain's Princess Cristina faces 8 years in prison if convicted of tax fraud. She's the first Spanish royal to sit in the defendant's dock.
YDSTIE: Yeah. Well, even though the overall economy is strong, for traditional retailers, there are challenges like online shopping. Walmart says those Sam's Club stores were underperforming. The company does say it is going to convert about a dozen of them to e-commerce fulfillment centers, so some of those workers may be rehired.
It was a striking moment in a 40-year fight over drilling in the coastal plain, an area that's home to migrating caribou, polar bears, birds and other wildlife. It also potentially sits atop billions of barrels of oil, according to federal estimates.
: But as you say, benefits are much higher in other countries. I assume that employers, if not employees, are taxed rather heavily to support those benefits in those countries.
The federal funds rate is an important interest rate, and it influences other interest rates — on mortgages, business loans, credit cards, etc. — in the short term, but the Fed's power over interest rates in general is very limited. The market ultimately determines real interest rates, not the Fed.
RAZ: And do you can them or preserve them?
Ms. TUCKER: I think that it is as a collection of many different points of view about government. Many of the Tea Partiers are on Medicare or Medicaid. And those are among the biggest government programs. They cost the budget the most and they don't want to see those cut. So, I think it will be interesting to see what happens in the midterm elections and whether this group is able to influence the outcome.
Aujla, for example, said that a lot of Americans moved to Canada in the 1990s and early 2000s not only because of politics but because of exchange rates. A strong dollar helped convince people they could afford life in Canada.
Even if there are questions about the number of bots on Twitter, the tone of the conversation there increasingly can't be denied. A recent study from the Anti-Defamation League found a total of 2.6 million tweets containing language frequently found in anti-Semitic speech were posted across Twitter between August 2015 and July 2016, with many aimed at political journalists. And a Bloomberg report found trolling on the service is keeping the company from finding a buyer.
In November 2009, independent broadcaster Olga Kotovskaya fell to her death from a 14th-floor window. She had been battling for control of her station with a member of the government. Her death was also ruled a suicide.
In addition, over 170,000 absentee votes were counted in Wisconsin without a valid absentee ballot application. So they had a vote, but they had no application, and that's illegal in Wisconsin. Meaning those votes were blatantly done in opposition to state law and they came 100% from Democrat areas such as Milwaukee and Madison, 100%.
This year, he released information about Cohen that appeared to come from a confidential government database. Attorneys for Cohen said that, for one thing, the material in Avenatti's file was partly inaccurate — it alluded to other men around the world named Michael Cohen, not their client.

TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: That's right. Well, Rachel, if you'll remember, President Trump wanted all U.S. forces out last fall, but agreed to keep a small number - about 600 or so - to secure these oilfields not only from ISIS, but also from Syrian government and Russian forces as well. Now, they want the Kurdish forces, who they're working with, to use the proceeds from the oil to pay for their operations against ISIS and also as leverage for any future political deal with the Syrian government.

Don't look for big changes quite yet, though the move could boost premiums and reduce choices among plans as early as 2019.
For the party to move forward, the best thing that could happen really would be for Trump to speak to his supporters and tell them that he accepts the results [and] they should, too, she said.

The United States does not stack up favorably when compared to other nations with advanced economies when it comes to childhood poverty worldwide, according to a new report, which considered factors such as the lack of access to quality food, high adolescent birth rates and a child dropping out of school.
Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., said he will highlight the human suffering caused by the president's immigration policy by bringing Albertina Contreras Teletor and Yakelin Garcia Contreras, a mother and daughter who were separated at the Southern border last year.
And interestingly, and this is important, it's an actually more ambitious version than the original in the sense that it would be open to anybody, even people who have employer insurance right now. He would basically say, if you want, you can jump over to that public option. And for that matter, you can also jump over to a private insurance plan that's subsidized through healthcare.gov if that's a better deal for you. And together, those two changes - that actually could deliver a lot of price relief. In other words, people would see - would be able to save money on their premiums for people who now have employer policies that are starting to get expensive and they're sweating out the premiums. So that could be a pretty big difference.
He put a series of tripwires in front of the president's lawyer and Michael Cohen literally tripped over every one of them, Turley said.

Her remarks came as Republicans on Capitol Hill and in the Trump administration pushed for changes to the measure. Pelosi said House Democrats had been negotiating with the White House throughout the morning.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
What I'm asking for is hard. It's easier to be cynical; to accept that change isn't possible, and politics is hopeless, and to believe that our voices and actions don't matter. But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future. Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war, or allow another economic disaster, or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure. As frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don't look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, or share the same background.

But it's definitely part of the House comprehensive tax reform plan.
And back to Russia, the president had an hour-long call with Vladimir Putin. And it almost was back to Helsinki because the president said he did not raise Russian interference in the 2016 election - he did not warn Russia not to meddle in the 2020 election - even though his own intelligence community says that the Russians have never given up trying. So another place where he's a party of one at odds with his own government.

Bridget Coyne, a senior manager at Twitter, points to several features the company has added to those 140-character tweets: polls, photos, video, Moments and more.

Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, was passed in 2010. Since then, there have been many unsuccessful attempts by Republicans to kill it. The left has been pushing to have the government insure everyone directly through what's described as Medicare for All. Now this debate is happening during a pandemic, when health care is at the forefront of people's minds.
For small brewers, lower taxes would be a welcome change because competition is intense. A decade ago, about 1,500 small breweries were operating nationwide. Now, that number is approaching 6,000.
Christian colleges and universities also have to consider Title IX of the Higher Education Amendments of 1972: No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.
We will have more on this story as it develops.

KAHN: It looks like it did. You know, Guatemala is very dependent on the U.S. It's its No. 1 trading partner. And Trump had threatened to slap tariffs on Guatemalan goods. He also threatened to tax remittances. And that's the money that Guatemalans working in the U.S. send back home. We're talking about more than $9 billion last year, and that would have been a big hit to poor Guatemalans dependent on that cash flow. And Trump had threatened to ban Guatemalans from traveling to the U.S. And I talked with business leaders there who are just telling their president, President Morales, just sign the deal. You know, its consequences can't be worse than any of these other sanctions.
If Republicans Repeal Health Law, Paying For A Replacement Could Be Tough
In late October, she called the campus counseling center hotline and met with a psychologist. All I wanted was someone to listen to me and validate the fact that I wasn't going crazy, Singh says.
A narrow plurality do think Trump is keeping his campaign promises (48 percent who do and 45 percent who don't), but most people disagree with some of the president's recent decisions. Fifty-three percent of those surveyed said they opposed Trump pulling out of the Paris climate accord earlier this month, while just 30 percent supported it.
MCCAIN: Thank you, Terry. And thank you for some very tough and interesting questions.
Greene and Cheney, of course, still have congressional seats and sizable social media followings, and they appear regularly on national television. All of which raises the question of what exactly it means to be canceled.
Since the House leadership hasn't provided any rationale why these provisions would be temporary and the economic case for temporary expensing in the current economic environment is quite small, the CRFB wrote in one analysis, it seems likely that the expiration date is intended to artificially reduce the cost of this bill and set up a costly extension later.
GREENE: Sounds reassuring, sounds optimistic. I mean, what do you make of that?
This is FRESH AIR. At the recent Sundance Film Festival, the top prize in the world cinema dramatic competition went to The Souvenir, written and directed by Joanna Hogg. The movie, which stars Honor Swinton Byrne as a London film student, is the first half of a projected two-part drama based on events from Hogg's life. Film critic Justin Chang has this review.
[According to annual totals, more than 12 million more people were receiving SNAP benefits in 2015 than in 2009. However, Trump is wrong that the total is growing and growing so rapidly. The total number of recipients has fallen every month since December 2015, according to the USDA. And by the annual numbers, participation has been falling since 2013. — Danielle Kurtzleben]
Sanders may ask for big changes to the primary system at the Democratic National Convention this summer. Seth Masket is skeptical that the party would push for national changes, but suggested what that might look like.
MARTIN: Domenico Montanaro, NPR's lead political editor for us this morning - Domenico, thank you. We appreciate it.
GINGRICH: Right. And the Senate passed the right bill which will guarantee them that they get paid when this is over, period. So they will all get compensated. Whether they go to work or not, whether they're laid off or not, everybody will get paid. So nobody, on an annual basis, nobody will lose money.
SANDERS: Thank you all very much.

The Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund list is a virtual who's who of some of the most polluted sites in the country. From 1980 to 1995, the cleanup at those sites was funded primarily by a tax on the oil and chemical industries. But that tax was allowed to expire, and the EPA has since struggled to complete its work.
UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting) Donald Trump has got to go. Hey, hey, ho, ho.
My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans — to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American dream, Trump said. Because Americans are dreamers too.
Trump has proposed eliminating the AMT, which is aimed at preventing taxpayers from paring down their tax bills by using an inordinate number of deductions and exemptions.
SEBRELL: Well, one of the things is it's very hard to find qualified teachers who will stay. There's not always a lot to offer to people who are coming in to teach. Housing sometimes can be a problem. Living in a home in the country, you're going to deal with leaking roofs and mice, and sometimes that can be a problem, finding a place that you want to live in, just a house, so that you're not driving back and forth. So a lot of our teachers do come in from the triangle area - Raleigh, Durham - and they drive, you know, an hour in the morning or an hour and a half in the morning and again in the afternoon. And when you have long hours, that makes it really tough as well.
OSNOS: And that gets us back to this kind of the core discovery that surprised me most which is that even when candidates don't seek to do the things that they actually said they would on the stump that the internal momentum of politics ends up forcing them to do things that are more emphatic or more absolute than perhaps they might have originally imagined.
Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., will bring Sandra Diaz, a former undocumented immigrant who worked at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., for a number of years.
Without copies of Trump's tax returns, the claims by his lawyers cannot be verified. The lawyers did not define Russians. Many companies based in Russia use subsidiaries in other places, such as Cyprus or the British Virgin Islands, to conduct transactions overseas.
SIMON: Did we, maybe without noting it, pass a corner this week in which the Russia investigation - Mueller, Michael Cohen, all of that - has gone from examining if there was obstruction of justice to actual collusion with Russia by the Trump campaign?
But because those countries have a stronger safety net, fewer children [in those countries] live in poverty.
So the former vice president decisively won four of yesterday's contests, and that includes Michigan. That state's 125 delegates were considered a must-win for Senator Bernie Sanders to keep up in the race. Biden is now even further ahead of Sanders. And at the end of the night, Biden tried to make it sound like the nomination is a done deal.
DAVIES: Now, when people look at Donald Trump, some would say it's not clear that he has any deeply held political beliefs. I mean, he used to be pro-choice. He used to be a Democrat. He's kind of been all over the place over the course of his business career, and a lot of what he says seems kind of improvised, but we have some clues. I mean, there are two big appointments just announced. The Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, will be Trump's chief of staff, and at the same time, his campaign CEO, Steve Bannon, who is from the right wing Breitbart News, will be a senior adviser with equal status to Reince Priebus. What does this tell us about Trump's likely agenda?
Where there were rats and roaches and mice and ticks, where there was just unabated lead problems that were having devastating effects on the mental development of young people, Carson said. That was a problem for me and it stayed on my mind a lot.
The posh nautical club on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca still hosts a King's Cup sailing regatta each year. But the Spanish royal family are no longer regulars.
This has also been the hottest decade on record, and last year was just two-hundredths of a degree Fahrenheit cooler than the hottest year ever — 2016. The Earth continues to warm. The planet is now about 2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than 100 years ago, near the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. And it only continues to climb.
New financial support for parents: Democrats approved a major temporary overhaul to the child tax credit that could mean most families with children would receive monthly payments if the bill becomes law. The legislation increases the existing child tax credit to $3,000 for children 6 to 17 and $3,600 for children under 6. The amount is gradually reduced for couples earning over $150,000 and individuals earning over $75,000 per year. Families eligible for the full credit would get payments of $300 per child, per month, from July 2021 through the end of the year.
So this is one big worry on the level of individual countries and then even bigger worries what's happening on the international level because so far, we have seen a really disastrous lack of leadership in the world, like there is no adults in the room. There is no global plan of how to tackle the health emergency or the economic crisis. And we are - we haven't seen the worst of it yet. I think the worst would come when the epidemic and the economic crisis hits developing countries in Central and South America, in Africa and the Middle East. The U.S. can have a rescue package of $2 trillion, but Ecuador or Egypt or Bangladesh can't. So the question is, when and if we will see a global plan, how to tackle both the epidemic and the resulting economic crisis.
Salahi's firm filed a class action lawsuit that successfully challenged the IRS's policy, and the government eventually dropped an appeal to the lawsuit in December. But Salahi said it is still very difficult for incarcerated people to receive payments.
Now, that says the same thing. It defines the same event. But the way he said it - that's art. I don't care that it's history. That is art. You feel like you're right there in the middle of the storm, travelling with him.

The Democratic response: Bullies, partisanship and chaos
On Monday, Trump offered his first real ideas on this topic. Previously, he dismissed concerns about childcare. He said it was, quote, not an expensive thing because you just need some blocks and you need some swings.
[Sanders had a lot of issues that he was deeply passionate about, including trade, but it wouldn't be at the top of his list. His campaign revolved most intensely around two things: income inequality and a broken campaign finance system. — Tamara Keith]
Then, in 1998, two years after welfare reform passed, a broader form of family assistance was introduced: the child tax credit, which is the basis of the current child benefit proposals.
Previously released Census Bureau research shows the question — Is this person a citizen of the United States? — is highly likely to deter households with noncitizens from participating in the constitutionally mandated head count of every person living in the country. That has sparked multiple lawsuits over the question by states, cities and other groups concerned about how the question may harm the accuracy of census numbers and how political representation and federal funding are shared over the next decade.
SIMON: What does this affordability crisis look like for an American family when they look at their budget?

Early Thursday morning, DeVos, Cruz and Byrne authored an op-ed in USA Today, writing, This program won't take a single cent from local public school teachers or public school students.
ORNSTEIN: Well, we have, of course, the most famous one, which is now being called with hashtags all over Twitter, the Corker kickback, named for Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee who had famously said quite early on I will not vote for any tax bill that adds a dime to the deficit and then turned around at the last minute and voted for this one with a provision added very, very late in the game to provide additional benefits to a particular set of real estate LLC's, as they're called, a particular kind of corporation. And Corker has significant investments in them, as does Donald J. Trump and other members of the Trump family - something that would specifically give them millions in additional tax benefits.
RAZ: And so the first computer network communication was, well, it was supposed to be the word login, L-O-G-I-N.
INSKEEP: And with Robert Costa of The Washington Post who's in our studios. Welcome back, sir.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So there's a lot in your proposal. But in broad strokes, can you talk about some of the ways you're looking at addressing both mass incarceration and the institutions that you say benefit from that system? You'd say...

Today's data provides more ammunition for those arguing that the Fed should cut interest rates at its next meeting, Josh Bivens, research director at the Economic Policy Institute, said in a statement. A growth slowdown is clearly happening.
HASSETT: I think that - so neither Alan nor I are professional forecasters. We work in different areas in the field - or he worked. But I find that, looking back, that the times when we disagreed, it tended to be because I was incorrect, and he was correct (laughter). He was just one of the greatest living economists. And, you know, I mean, it was really, at times, humbling to be in a room with him because he just had a way to see through the difficult issues that very few people have, and he did it with such congeniality. You know, he would sort of say, well, Kevin, did you think about it this way? And of course that meant that I had gotten it really, terribly wrong.
For hospitals, there is supposed to be a relief valve. The Internal Revenue Service requires all nonprofit hospitals to have a financial assistance policy that lowers or eliminates bills for people without the financial resources to pay them. Such financial assistance — commonly known as charity care — is a condition for any hospital that wants to maintain its tax-exempt status; that status shields the facility from having to pay property taxes on its often expansive campus.
High-volume attack advertising could change that. Elizabeth Wilner, of Kantar Media/CMAG, a media tracking firm, said that if the attacks start sticking, Trump may have to buy airtime for ads that rebuild his image.
Today, Medicaid pays for all the care people need, and state and federal governments share the cost.
The $940 billion bill seeks to extend health coverage to most Americans. Medicaid, the federal-state program that provides health insurance to the poor and disabled, will be expanded to cover all adults earning less than 133 percent of the federal poverty level.
THOMPSON: Every time I come out here, I am super surprised at how many, you know, older folk are here. I think that's really important for them to turn out.
Others, like a lifetime ban on lobbying for former members of Congress, presidents, Cabinet secretaries and other officeholders, have long been touted by good government advocates.
MCEVERS: To start, how seriously should we be taking these polls?
McConnell put out his own statement and seemed to agree. He wants senators to vote to put the House health care bill on the floor and allow a vote to repeal major pieces of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
English directs a program training formerly homeless men and women to share their stories in public. One of the program's goals is put individual faces on L.A.'s massive homeless crisis. English says she tells community members to think of a couple of things when faced with a person on the street who appears intoxicated or disruptive.
ESPUELAS: Well, I think ultimately there is national consensus. Gallup published a poll about a month ago or so which showed over 70 percent of Americans want immigration reform with a path toward citizenship. But at the same time, there is a group within the Republican Party - maybe the Tea Party would be the right name for it - that is adamantly against it and has pledged to oppose it. So since we've learned with the shutdown that perhaps Speaker Boehner is not totally in charge of his caucus, he might want to bring it up, but that may not mean that they will bring it up.
DAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: Well, Evan Osnos, welcome back to FRESH AIR. How reliable are campaign promises as a predictor of a president's agenda in office, and will Trump be different?
The Italian economy is not growing, says Carlo Cottarelli, an Italian economist and former director of the International Monetary Fund. The Italian per capita income is the same as it was 20 years ago. In terms of economic growth, this past decade has been the worst since 1861.
The plan also calls for $132 billion for unemployment benefits, with $300 per week through the end of June, as opposed to Biden's plan to continue the benefit through September.
You know, I think it's pretty extraordinary to think right now that Republicans are very quickly getting on board with this. Cash payments are something that they have typically been opposed to in the past. But even conservative senators like Tom Cotton of Arkansas, you know, have been in favor of this cash payment process, you know, since early today, late yesterday. That is a sign that this is very, very likely to get approved.
Republicans have privately raised additional concerns with the unemployment, Medicaid and paid family and sick leave portions of the legislation. The unemployment section of the bill would add an extra 26 weeks of benefits for states that experience an increase of 10 percent or more in unemployment rate during the crisis.
Retailers see women as their biggest target, Ted Potrikus, CEO of the Retail Council of New York State, told USA Today. Research and development, following trends, meeting trends, advertising products on television and in magazines are not cheap.
After the court declined to intervene on Monday, Trump denounced the case as political persecution and a fishing expedition, while Vance posted a three-word tweet: The work continues.
With today's WikiLeaks revelations we are finding out who Hillary Clinton really is, and it's not hard to see why she fought so hard to keep her transcripts of speeches to Wall Street banks paying her millions of dollars secret.
Romney opposed Trump's candidacy in 2016, calling him a phony, a fraud, but was willing to join his administration and met with the president-elect over dinner; he was widely considered to be a candidate for secretary of state. He was also endorsed by Trump in his Senate bid.
I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.

The History Behind The Highs And Lows Of The Marginal Tax Rate
NPR's Scott Simon asks Rhode Island author Paul Caranci about a provision in his state's tax code that exempts certain works of art from sales tax.
You govern with all the instincts of a businessperson but you have to add much more heart and soul into your decisions than you would ever have even thought of before.
Many insurers added the premium surcharges last fall to plans sold on the individual market. It was a response to the Trump administration's announcement that it would no longer pay the companies for the cost-sharing reduction subsidies required under the health law. The subsidies help cover deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for lower-income consumers who buy marketplace plans.
ELVING: Good to be here with you, Tam.
And that's one of the reasons that, even after the violent insurrection at the Capitol, two-thirds of House Republicans and a total of eight senators voted to throw out some of the election results.

MORRIS: Despite heavy recruiting, both USDA research agencies are now roughly half the size they were before the move. The number of economic reports coming out has dropped by half. Federally funded university research isn't getting the guidance or scrutiny it once did. And experienced staffers, like Desiree Rucker at NIFA, say they are running on fumes.
She briefly served as an assistant district counsel for the U.S. Justice Department before taking a position as senior assistant parliamentarian in 1999. It was a post she would hold for the 13 years, before being assuming her current role.

GONYEA: After the rally, the cleanup crew stacks the folding chairs. Music still pipes through the sound system. And with Senator Sanders tied up with the impeachment trial in these days before Iowa and New Hampshire, he'll need the people who show up at events like these to reach out to potential backers and to show that the grassroots can turn out the vote, even if the candidate is around a lot less.

According to the CBO, the original BCRA would have cut Medicaid spending by $772 billion over 10 years, and would have resulted in 15 million fewer Medicaid enrollees by 2026 than under current law.
While some veterans are working to repay the money, others are filing appeals, engaging in what's likely to be a prolonged fight against the service to which they once belonged. California National Guard officials tell the Times that they've been helping veterans through the appeals process.
And there is some evidence for this: Workers are not sharing in growth nearly as much as they used to — more of that new income has gone to shareholders, for example.
There is a very serious worry that we might lose our manufacturing edge over the next 10-20 years and be in the same situation the U.S. is now — except, without having grown a new growth engine like the IT sector in the meantime, Zettelmeyer says.
Representing the People of New York during this pivotal era for our city and our justice system has been the privilege of a lifetime, the 66-year-old Vance said.

The CDC says they can start hanging out inside without masks with other vaccinated people, even with unvaccinated people who are at low risk. Here's Ali Mokdad at the University of Washington. He says by the summer, a lot more people will be eating out, taking vacations.
In the midst of Senate negotiations on a massive stimulus package in response to the coronavirus pandemic, House Democrats have drafted their own counterproposal titled the Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act.
How do the Germans do it? Are there any lessons for the U.S.?
KING: OK. President Trump, we should note, suggested on Twitter possibly a payroll tax cut. That's one other example of a stimulus. I want to ask, because you mentioned the R word, recession - we don't like asking economists to make predictions. But since you brought it up, are you predicting a recession?
Senate Bill 510 recognizes the plants as carbon free energy and adds nuclear power to the state's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard — a 2004 law requiring electric utilities to buy power from a list of clean and alternative energy sources, like wind and solar.
And at least half of Trump's supporters agreed with him on that, according to a pre-election survey by RAND Corp., a research group.
For seven years, I've been hearing repeal and replace from Congress, Trump said of congressional Republicans. I've been hearing it loud and strong, and when we finally get a chance to repeal and replace, they don't take advantage of it.
And a reminder that the vice presidential debate is tomorrow night. That will be airing on many NPR stations, and our live coverage will begin at 9 p.m. Eastern. Robert Siegel will be your host, and keep an eye, too, on npr.org where we will be fact-checking the debate in real time.
KENNEDY: It is heartbreaking. And a lot of our restaurant owners view their employees as family - almost all of them do. What am I saying? But it's one in which we are really struggling with the best approach we can take. That's why our big ask - making such an aggressive ask of Congress right now. This is a national pandemic. It's a public emergency.
Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health and Security, was equally as dubious.
SAGAL: And I guess from now on, unforeseen everything.
KIM: Well, yesterday, Putin delivered his annual state of the nation address. And he started out by saying he was making this speech earlier in the year than normal because there were a whole lot of changes he wanted to implement.
And so there's a thought that Cruz - he's going to keep the party safe on ideological lines, and he's going to run a conservative campaign. But he's not necessarily going to expand the map. And that's what's tantalizing to some people about Trump. Could he expand the map? Even though he turns off so many minority voters and women voters, could he, for some reason, get disengaged voters who haven't participated for years to come out?
Researchers are also still trying to define the most common symptoms, establish roughly how many long-haulers there are, and determine how many of them have symptoms that are truly debilitating.

In its statement, the service adds that its adjutant general, Maj. Gen. David S. Baldwin, created an assistance center that has helped some of its soldiers retain $37 million of original bonus payments.
Lawmakers, along with the president and first lady, pick guests every year to highlight or protest the policies of an administration.
President Trump's State of the Union address included some surprising moments — both emotional announcements and a blunt reaction from the speaker of the House — all playing out live before a prime-time audience.
Still, Peace figured he wasn't hurting anyone, and for a while she thought of the man as an unofficial neighbor. That is, until one day she came downstairs to get into her car, said her usual greeting and was met with a blank stare instead of the usual friendly 'hello.'
He said, If you know better the spatial behavior of people, you can imagine more realistic bottom-up, participative solutions intended to reach more egalitarian situations...
To your knowledge, did the president ever provide inflated assets to an insurance company? she asked. Yes, Cohen replied. Who else knows that the president did this? Ocasio-Cortez continued. Allen Weisselberg, Ron Lieberman and Matthew Calamari, Cohen said, referring to several Trump associates. And she also asked about Trump trying to reduce local tax bills by then deflating the value of his assets, pointing to one of his golf courses in her district which has been the subject of such reports.
Over the years, some landowners sued when they felt they were being cheated. That has led to a patchwork of court rulings in many states, determining how leases are interpreted.
By ending catch-and-release on the border, we will end the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. We will stop it, it won't be happening very much anymore. Believe me.
And that was it. The first-ever computer network communication was LO. The ARPANET was born. About an hour later, they actually did get it to work. They successfully transmitted the word L-O-G-I-N. Charlie Kline then scribbled some notes into a logbook and went home to bed. Bill Duvall also called it a night.
And the Democrat Party operatives entered into an illegal and unconstitution — unconstitutional settlement agreement that drastically weakened signature verification and other election security procedures.
However, there are some pieces of it that are vulnerable right away. For instance, Donald Trump and a Republican Congress could undermine the ability of the states to field health care exchanges. They could also remove federal funding for subsidies that help reduce the cost for individual policyholders.
She might get that chance this summer. The new child allowance payments are set to start in July.

His group analyzed gas industry data and found only enough waste methane potential to cover 13% of current natural gas use in the U.S.
A widely cited Congressional Budget Office estimate says most of those funds remain to be spent. But school leaders say the money is spoken for and they need more.
Below is Trump's speech in its entirety, with annotations and fact-checks from NPR's team of political and economic reporters.
Coal-fired power plants are just uneconomic and are continuing to retire, says Dan Lashof, director of the World Resources Institute. But much of the power from coal plans has been replaced by natural gas-fired power plants, and we need to start making that transition away from gas. And that means doubling or tripling the pace at which we're building wind and solar over the next decade.
However, in a presentation to lawmakers on Wednesday leaders outlined a 2017 program that included a specific timeline, including:
DAVIS: The challenge Democrats have is there's really not much they can do about it. You know, Senate Democrats could go so far as to try to fire the parliamentarian. That's happened in the past. Or they could vote to overrule her. But there appears to be no interest for either of those extreme measures from either Senate leaders or the White House. Speaker Pelosi has said the House will take up a standalone minimum wage hike, but, you know, we believe Democrats can pass in the House. But again, it's going to hit this wall in the Senate because it doesn't have the 60-vote supermajority it would need to pass as a standalone bill.
When Benjamin Franklin said the only two certainties in life are death and taxes, he wasn't talking about income taxes. America didn't really even have an income tax until 1913. Up until then, the U.S. relied on tariffs to raise revenue.
Congressional Democrats unveiled a measure for a legislative stimulus package aimed at mitigating the economic damage stemming from the coronavirus.
SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Mary Louise.
Trump's new budget proposal projects that the deficit can be trimmed by $4.6 trillion over a decade and sees a balanced budget possible in 15 years, Vought said.
It also means we should not sign petitions or otherwise contribute support or money to political causes or public campaigns. Also: we don't put political signs in our yards or bumper stickers on our cars, and if family members get involved in politics we recuse ourselves from any coverage that touches on their activities and we do our best to maintain our independence from their pursuits.
Rubio and Lee argue that a cash allowance with no strings attached could discourage recipients from working — the same argument made during the welfare reform debate in the '90s.
But Caroline Pearson, a senior vice president at the consulting firm Avalere Health, says the bill bases its tax credits on lower-quality insurance.If you're paying a similar percentage of income, you're getting a less generous product under this new plan, she says.
You don't know the man? Oh, well, he's everywhere. In the White House, down the hall, he rants in the movie School of Rock. He adds, And there used to be a way to stick it to the man. It was called rock 'n' roll.
LIASSON: That's a really interesting question. Donald Trump has acknowledged that he is slipping in the polls.
I am reiterating the president's clear commitment in the clearest terms possible: that he's not raising taxes on those that make less than $250,000 a year, Gibbs said.
Last year, Pennsylvania's bipartisan Nuclear Energy Caucus issued a report calling carbon pricing the best long term solution.
Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it very, very quickly.
And it's not just conservatives who back the policy: Jason Furman, former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama White House, likewise championed the policy earlier this year.

7 Women's Health Topics We Need To Talk About In 2020
Economist Nisreen Salti, an associate professor at the American University of Beirut who studies the health sector, believes it is unlikely there will be a complete breakdown in the health care system, but believes the availability of expensive and critical life-saving medicines, including cancer drugs, will decline — except to the privileged, a shrinking pool of people covered by what is available.
CHANG: What raised Trump's hackles this time were questions from The Washington Post about whether he had actually raised and distributed $6 million for veterans' causes, as he's been claiming for months. We called up NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik and asked him whether this week marked Trump's worst attack on the press so far in his campaign.

At the end of the day, of course, deftly avoiding Hispandering minefields is one thing, and genuinely connecting with voters is another. As columnist Cepeda pointed out during the last run for the White House, it's a mistake to treat Hispanic voters as one entity. Hispanics' political views are as dramatically varied as those of white voters, she wrote. Hispanics want to be acknowledged, welcomed in the political arena, listened to and respected.
So there's a big difference here between how someone is viewed when they're viewed as the person who's going to be the nominee and when they're not.
GROSS: Did you, after returning to the United States, ever have any doubts about the war and whether it should have been fought?
If new research from network science is right, though, there may be something easy and simple almost anyone can do to help bring more economic equality into the world.
Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. That's sixteen years ago.
Here's What's In The American Rescue Plan
The real issue becomes not what givers are getting back, but how much they're actually giving. Is the company that is painting pink ribbons on rain boots really sharing the profit? Is the high school senior who is volunteering in Costa Rica really making a difference in the life of sea turtles?
Prior to her resignation, federal investigators were looking into the book sales, many of which went to entities she had influence over or businesses that hoped to do business with the city and the state.

So, Kathleen, I'll start with you. You know, what about the White House argument that - and the Republican leadership argument that the Democrats are to blame because they're not willing to let the DACA issue go to keep the government running? Now, in your state, just as in Puneet's, there are a lot of federal workers, as well as a lot of military people. How do you defend that?
It's a disgrace that the United States of America, tens of millions of people, are allowed to go vote without so much as even showing identification.
As for being repaid, Cohen detailed how that was set up as well.
Disney is currently shooting Guardians of the Galaxy 2 in Georgia.
GREEN: Well, I think it's more likely that the software, given the way this conversation is going, is going to say to you, we know that these shoes are important to you, buy these shoes and we will work with you to figure out how we can afford these shoes. Which might very well be shuffling some things around, financially, for you, or may very well be, we're going to borrow against your future so you can get these shoes now and this is the plan that we're going to use to make sure that all gets paid back.
But that repayment didn't come immediately — and Cohen showed that it stretched into Trump's time in the Oval Office in 2017. Instead of paying in a lump sum, smaller payments were used to make it look like Cohen was simply being paid a legal retainer. One check he showed lawmakers was for $35,000 and was dated Aug. 1, 2017 — signed by Trump well into his first year in office. Another, dated March 17, 2017, was signed by Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg and Donald Trump Jr., the president's eldest son.
And the decline of new coronavirus cases in China does suggest there is an opportunity for the government to slow or even stop the outbreak. But, you know, Europe and the United States are still in the early stages of that curve. So there's still just a lot of uncertainty about what the economic consequences are going to be.
Democrats on Capitol Hill are skeptical about a payroll tax cut, although it is a way to get some more money into the economy and it was done during the recovery from the Great Recession. It's relatively slow, and it only helps people who are on the payroll, not those whose jobs have been disrupted by the outbreak. The president's own advisers have also said, though, he is interested in helping people who don't have sick leave, and that's one area where you see some agreement between the administration and Democrats on the Hill.
China, Japan, South Korea, Germany, Belgium, England, Spain, Yemen ... and where else? Oman? says Isaksen, listing the places he has traveled to through his work. Working under contract for three to four months straight, he lives on a boat where he stands on navigational watch. That's followed by three to four months of paid vacation time onshore. The goal is to work six months out of the year and make enough money before finding a new contract as his vacation time ends, he says. It's not for the faint of heart. You miss out on family and friends and girlfriends, holidays and birthdays. Isaksen has his eye on starting a family and owning a home, and he doesn't see himself doing contract work with this kind of schedule for more than a couple of years.
KEITH: But when President Trump talks about, oh, those scary Democrats, they want to take your guns away, what he's talking about is Beto O'Rourke and people who would support a mandatory gun buyback.
SAGAL: Katie Couric, it is a pleasure to talk to you. And we have asked you here today to play a game that this time we're calling...
BOLTON: Where he broke through was in the - 2005, 2006, when he became chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. In fact, he was even looking at possibly running for governor of New York in 2006 because the Democrats were mired in the minority. The Democratic leader at the time, Harry Reid, said, hey, please do this, and I'll give you some enticement. Put him on the powerful Senate Finance Committee, which, of course, is very important to New York and its financial services.
LEVINE: Right. And I think you do see that. And it's interesting you bring up health care. The Koch network has spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the years running issue ads and other advertising themed around health care, pointing to that as a critical issue for them. And I think you're starting to see them move away from that, move towards touting the tax overhaul that Republicans passed last year as a big achievement. I do think that if the tax overhaul hadn't passed, Republicans would have a lot more problems raising money that cycle. I think that you're going to see some checkbooks more open because they were able to pass that.
HORSLEY: Republican Mayor Jeff Williams of Arlington, Texas, says his city is spending $400,000 a week to support local vaccination efforts, even as it's preparing for a likely drop in property taxes.
So - look; I didn't like, Terry, the things that happened. But for me to look back in anger over something that happened back five years ago is not appropriate. I want to move forward. I want to put it behind me. And I want to serve the people of Arizona in the Senate. I think it's wrong to hold a grudge in American politics.
Budget bills come with a special voting bonanza called a vote-arama that kicks off when the required 50 hours of debate are over.
KURTIS: He won - 2 out of 3, senator. Congratulations.
Now what they do is they go silent. It's called suppression and that's what happens in a communist country. That's what they do, they suppress. You don't fight with them anymore. Unless it's a bad story. They have a little bad story about me, they make it 10 times worse and it's a major headline.
In September, just 40% of Republicans said they thought a third party was necessary. That has now jumped to 63%, according to Gallup.
There was no $1 trillion infrastructure bill passed during Obama's presidency. The closest thing was the stimulus, though — which cost around $800 billion and which proponents often touted as boosting infrastructure. That bill was quickly cobbled together in the face of economic crisis; at the time, unemployment in the U.S. was around 8 percent and still rising. This stimulus package appears to be what Trump was referring to.
Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren insists that she is not running for president in 2020, I'm running for the Senate in 2018. The senator also said Tuesday that she is urging Democrats to focus on midterm elections and stop acting like the only important shiny object in the room is 2020.
There's 350 million liquid fuel cars on the road today in the United States and most Americans don't buy a new car except every decade, says Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the program on Energy Security and Climate Change at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Well, let me tell you something. When I started at 60 or 70 points behind Secretary Clinton — how was that? Was that a pretty steep hill to climb?
Some of our family members — including spouses, companions and children — may be involved in politics or advocacy. We are sensitive to the perception of bias. So we inform our supervisors and work with them to avoid even the appearance of conflicts of interest.

The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll surveyed 1,205 adults from June 21-25 contacted by live interviewers using a mix of landline and mobile numbers. There is a 2.8-percentage point margin of error. A sub-sample of 995 registered voters were also surveyed, with a 3.1-percentage point margin of error.
I have an excellent relationship with President Xi, and we will continue working together on many issues, the president said in a statement. But the United States will no longer be taken advantage of on trade by China and other countries in the world.
Biden Invites 10 GOP Senators To White House To Talk COVID-19 Relief
MANN: Yeah, this is where it gets a little controversial. In financial filings, the firms also say they plan to declare those opioid payments as operating losses, which is a deduction, right? It's similar to one you or I might use if we want to pay less in our federal income taxes. So if they pay $26 billion, it looks like these four companies together would get roughly $4 billion back in tax benefits. That really angers some lawmakers, including Congressman Jimmy Gomez. He's a Democrat from California.
MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Happy to be here.

The fee, one of a wide range of gas industry regulations imposed by the state's Act 13 in 2012, depends on the age of a well and the market price of gas, which has been little changed at less than $5 per btu since 2014, according to futures prices quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
[This Moody's report tried to project the effects of a bundle of Trump's policies together. They projected that employment would grow at first, but then jobs would disappear. Ultimately, they wrote, the U.S. would lose 3.4 million jobs during a Trump presidency under his policies, compared to a 6 million gain under current law. That said, a forecast like this offers false precision, as the Upshot's Neil Irwin pointed out, as it is necessarily uncertain — the assumptions beneath the report, he wrote, involve some guesswork and are at least debatable. — Danielle Kurtzleben]
U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, a Democrat from New Jersey, has been trying to get a look at the Republicans' bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.
NICK REYNOSA: That's like a $5 Uber ride.
Together, we will drain the Washington swamp and we will clean up the corruption in our nation's capital. We have done a big job on it, but you think it's easy. It's a dirty business. It's a dirty business. You have a lot of bad people out there.
The Democrats' latest bill, which is more than 1,400 pages long, would prevent corporations from using taxpayer money for stock buybacks, boost unemployment insurance, strengthen the child and earned income tax credits and inject nearly $40 billion into schools and universities to stabilize funding. It also directs billions of dollars in grant funding for states to carry out this year's election through the Election Assistance Commission.
But it's not just money, it's also familiar cultural fights. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who has faced criticism for his role in objecting to Biden's win ahead of the violence at the Capitol, said Tuesday that he was putting a hold on Biden's choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas.
Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin, the state's top securities regulator, also sounded a warning about the situation. The marketplace should be a place where risk is taken, but not reckless risk and not a situation that undermines the system, and that's what we're looking at here, Galvin said on CNBC.
GROSS: So Republicans, you know, had been trying to defeat it before it was passed and continued, you know, after it was passed. Where do we stand now? It wasn't, to my knowledge, a major issue in the 2020 campaign. Have Republicans given up on trying to unravel or cancel Obamacare?
Those promises he's making at his rallies? They're the same promises he made to his customers at Trump University. Now they're suing him for fraud.
The center's analysis looked only at the tax provisions of the latest bill, not measures like unemployment benefits or aid to cities and states.

Businesses dislike many parts of the ACA, including its substantial paperwork, the mandate to offer coverage and the Cadillac tax on high-benefit plans (which is set to take effect in 2020). But large companies in particular — those that have always offered job-based insurance — say a poorly thought-out replacement might turn out to be worse for them and their workers.
The budget is no better. President Obama has almost doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing. And yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.
Here are 11 trend lines we'll be watching in 2020. First we'll give you the bad news — then the hopeful predictions.

So AOC is right, right? Seventy percent - that isn't the highest marginal tax rate we've had. But I was thinking about the Davos clip. When Michael Dell makes a statement similar to, there's no country that's ever had a tax rate that's high, that's had financial and economic success and the economist on the panel said, uh, America, I just find the notion that people - well, really the billionaires - are freaking out about the possibility of their taxes going up when historically at the very beginning of our, quote, progressive income tax system the only people who paid were the millionaires and the billionaires.

On infrastructure, the president will outline his $1 trillion plan to rebuild the country's roads, bridges and more — something he has long hoped to champion in Congress. Such an effort could draw bipartisan support but has so far lacked specifics.

Pelosi insisted Wednesday on the House floor that the package is coronavirus-centric. Furthermore, referring to the projected impact of the expanded child tax credit, she said, How do you say no to lifting 50% of impoverished children in America out of poverty?
That's why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever; we shouldn't weaken them, we should strengthen them. And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today. That's what the Affordable Care Act is all about. It's about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when we lose a job, or go back to school, or start that new business, we'll still have coverage. Nearly eighteen million have gained coverage so far. Health care inflation has slowed. And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.

My position on trade is all about workers. His position on trade is something else. I appreciate the efforts to renegotiate NAFTA, but the president's not even close to being in the right place on NAFTA if he's not going to have strong enforcement for labor standards, which they don't have yet.
The real problem, though, has been the marketplace and how insurers have slowly left. This is having an impact - the high deductibles and the lack of options - on real people. I spoke with a mother, Corrine Bobby (ph), who lives just north of Phoenix. And her daughter was born with a complex congenital heart disease. And so she was thrilled when the ACA happened and her daughter could get coverage. But even to this day, she can't afford insurance for the rest of her family.

That is not a vaccine for use. That's just testing if it's safe. Then, when you show it's safe, after an additional three or four months, then you've got to show it works. That's what we call a phase 2 trial. That takes at least another six to eight months. We would not have a vaccine available for at least a year to a year and a half - at best.

What would happen to the middle class depends entirely on the details. Under the current Medicare for All proposals, middle-class people would have no premiums, deductibles or copays, and save a lot of money on health care, he said. Whether they would pay more or less on net would depend on which taxes go up to pay for the plan.
Were this bill to pass the Senate, it would then have to be reconciled with the House's attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare, known as the American Health Care Act.
To that poor person, paying 40 cents instead of 10 cents — or, to make this example more practically applicable, $40 instead of $10 — could cut heavily into basics like grocery or rent money. But for the rich person, that $40 is far less likely to be a necessity. Instead, it could cut into, say, the cost of an Hermès scarf.

There are resources for state and local governments in the Democrats' package to support schools to get back to in-person learning in areas that are still struggling. House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy said the bill should be far smaller in size, targeted to get kids in classrooms full time and get mental health resources to those children suffering from learning largely virtually over the last year.
Under U.S. pressure, Switzerland, for one, has been persuaded to change its bank secrecy policies. Jack Blum says this has made it a lot harder for many people to hide their money. But this weekend's document dump shows that the very wealthy can still find ways to avoid taxes.
But how does anyone know that's what will happen?
ALLEN: Well, right. You know, it's been 20 years since Hugo Chavez took power down there. And first under his regime, then Nicolas Maduro, there's been this political repression, violence, runaway inflation. It's severely eroded the quality of life in a country that really was one of the most prosperous in Latin America for so many years. Many of those who've come to Florida are professionals, you know, doctors, lawyers, engineers. Here's Lea Salama Dimitri. She's an immigration lawyer and member of the Venezuelan American Bar Association. She says many of her clients just want to go back.
They don't have to decide. During the application process, the marketplace asks people for income information. If their annual income is below the Medicaid threshold (for many adults in most states, that's 138% of the federal poverty level --which works out to be about $18,000 for an individual), they will be directed to the state's Medicaid program for coverage. If people are eligible for Medicaid, they can't get subsidized coverage on an ACA exchange.
SELYUKH: The U.S. Travel Association estimates the virus will cost the industry 4.6 million jobs by the end of April. That's more than a quarter. And there are even wider concentric circles of work supported by tourism - airlines and hotels, sure, but also museum and parking lot attendants, hotdog and coffee cart sellers.
She added that issues with periods at school include embarrassment, stigma, missing classes, cost, discomfort and lack of knowledge.

Here is a look at some of those key priority areas and variables:
COHN: Yeah. Well, thank you for the sympathy. I learned a lot. You know, as someone who writes about health care, to be on the other end of it, sort of experiencing this and navigating this and trying to navigate the health care system - in that case, this is, you know, the technical term for nursing home care, assisted living, that's all called long-term care. And it's a real mess. It has - every problem of our health care system is exists in the long-term care system and it's worse. It's hard to figure out who pays what bill. You're constantly dealing with the networks. You think your insurance covers something, and then you discover that it doesn't. And you have to get on the phone and fight. And the amount of time you spend on this, you know, which is time you want to be spending with your loved one - and, you know, these are - you know, and anyone who's gone through this particular experience knows this is incredibly hard. You have some incredibly difficult decisions you have to make. You're constantly second guessing. And again, having to sort of spend your time, your emotional energy, dealing with insurance bureaucracies, dealing with all these payment questions. It's just - it makes it such a greater burden at a time when, even under the best of circumstances, it's an incredible burden.
Ramsey has helped utilities and major companies like Intel and Walmart switch to cleaner energy, and he says making hydrogen would be a great way to use large amounts of excess wind, solar and hydropower that can be difficult to store as electricity.
Read my lips, of course, was George H.W. Bush's famous challenge when he promised not to raise taxes during the 1988 GOP convention, only to reverse himself once in office.
One way companies have contained premiums is by shifting to high-deductible plans, in which the insurance covers little until workers have incurred thousands in medical bills. Even so, benefits in employer plans are generally richer than those in the average individual plan, say health policy analysts.
Taken together, Trump's plans could easily damage the economy. According to one analysis from Moody's Economics, Trump's policies taken at face value would create only 1.4 percent average growth per year over the next decade and lead to several years of negative employment growth.
And we're at this shutdown today - I don't know whether we can say this on the air, I haven't boned up on what the NPR policy about the S-hole thing is - but, you know, you realize that we are here today because the president of the United States basically tore the mask off when he talked about, you know, not bringing people in from S-hole countries as opposed to countries like Norway, as if Norway, by the way, is a skill. And I think that was so shocking and it was so toxic that it brings us to the moment we're at now. And this is the Trump presidency.
ROMNEY: Being in Donald Trump's magnificent hotel and having his endorsement is a delight. I'm so honored and pleased to have his endorsement.
SWINTON BYRNE: (As Julie) Yes, I am. I'm making a feature film.
Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents many IRS workers, tells NPR that since 2010 the agency has lost nearly 33,000 employees.
It is the law of the universe, she says. Equal and opposite force. No country with any common sense would allow a tariff to be put on their exports without meeting that with an equitable tariff of their own.
The judge in the case declared a mistrial for those 10 counts and the Justice Department has until next week to decide whether to retry Manafort on them or let the matter rest with the existing convictions.
So how Americans think about this could affect what they think should happen to the top tax rates on the richest. In 1980, the top 10 percent brought in 32 percent of all adjusted gross income, according to the Tax Foundation. In 2013, it was 46 percent. For example, many Americans also believe taxes should be raised on the richest. The top tax bracket starts at $418,400 right now.
National Security Adviser Michael Flynn made a surprise appearance at the daily press briefing to announce that the Trump administration was putting Iran on notice after the country conducted a ballistic missile test.
JUDY KIMILARY: I'd like him to stay off Twitter a little bit more.
While the corporate tax cuts in the bill are permanent, the individual cuts are set to expire in 2025.
OSNOS: Well, he in his very first interview since Election Day on 60 Minutes, Donald Trump said that he would plan to go ahead with deporting what he described as criminal undocumented immigrants. On one level, this is familiar and on another level, this could be very radical. The familiar element of this is that the Obama administration's own policy has been that if you are in fact an undocumented immigrant who is found guilty of a crime, then you are in fact subject to deportation. People sometimes forget that the Obama administration was criticized by some advocates for immigration for being too quick to deport people.
This is very welcoming because the old Saudi Arabia to be honest ... the system was not viable ... the country was going to collapse, says John Sfakianakis, director of economic research at the Gulf Research Center, in Riyadh.
The $38 million figure quoted by the White House included payroll taxes, Johnston said. When they are excluded, the Trump's total federal bill amounted to about $36.5 million.
Opposing superPACs spent just $1.3 million attacking Trump in the seven months from June 2015, when he announced, to December, when he led the polls. In July, there was no anti-Trump spending at all. Only when the Iowa caucuses loomed did the spending accelerate, to $4.4 million in January and $9.4 million in February.
Here are six of the highlights:
The administration requests $37 million to clean and disinfect thousands of facilities and provide assistance to over 400 Tribes in response to the coronavirus. In addition, the Bureau of Indian Education would receive $19 million for its' facilities.
How A President Trump Could Derail Obamacare By Dropping Legal Appeal
PALMIERI: I think it's all of it. I think that Trump is sort of baked into how voters are looking at the midterms and what you see in the campaigns. And I think this is - you know, the right thing to do is to focus on issues. And you're going to see a class come in that is really energized to make a difference on actual issues that affect people's lives.
RASCOE: ...The issue with what he said.
The six man, six woman jury ultimately convicted Manafort of eight charges and was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on 10 more counts Tuesday.
GILES: Well, we're seeing voting laws that would impact every step of the voting process, starting with getting registered. One measure would make it more difficult for county officials to go out into the community and hold voter registration drives. There was even a bill to abolish the incredibly popular vote-by-mail system in Arizona. The sponsor backtracked off that idea within hours of introducing the bill.
Then-Rep. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin sponsored HR 764 (United States Reciprocal Trade Act) two weeks prior to the president's address to Congress. It was referred to a subcommittee on trade in March, and no progress has been made since. — Scott Horsley
GINGRICH: Well, what I'd tell them is that, unfortunately, it is part of the American system. Now, look. I would love to have the federal employee unions, who are overwhelmingly Democratic, who are upset, would call Schumer and Pelosi and say, why is this such a big deal to you?
MAYER: Great to be with you.
Teachers are striking in Oakland, Calif. and West Virginia, continuing a nationwide trend of teachers' strikes over the past year. Here's what these strikes do and don't have in common.
Summers makes clear that he believes secular stagnation is not new. Japan has seen it for decades. Before the financial crisis, the U.S. had tax cuts, deficit spending, two wars and massive housing and debt bubbles, and the economy still didn't look amazing. In other words, it's possible that we're not living in the Upside Down. This is the Right-Side Up. The normal place. And those roaring periods of the past — when job-creating technologies, baby booms and expanding frontiers all rocketed our economy to good times — were, in fact, the alternate dimension.
SNELL: He's probably paying the most attention to Congressman Lou Barletta who won the primary to be the Republican candidate for Senate. Trump recorded a robocall for Barletta, and he's called him a good friend. And we kind of expect that Trump's going to come out to Pennsylvania and campaign for Barletta, which will bring up the question whether or not Republicans want to associate themselves with the president. It's going to be an ongoing question that happens throughout the state.
This week's Trump presidency Internet sideshow (see also: Melania appearing to bat Trump's hand away, the president's aggressive handshakes, the frenzy over Kellyanne Conway's inauguration outfit) came in the form of a couture-heavy Instagram post from Louise Linton, a Scottish-born actress and the wife of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

Will news organizations acquiesce to a new day without acknowledging the distinctive and dislocating nature of the Trump administration? Will they take an adversarial but conventional approach to covering his White House? Or will they take on an almost oppositional stance? I don't know — and I don't think they do, either.
Spicer brushed aside suggestions that much of the cost would be passed on to American consumers who purchase Mexican-made goods. He argued that cost would be outweighed by the reduction in illicit border crossings.
In the 1960s, India introduced a system of agricultural subsidies. The government paid for some pesticides and irrigation. That assistance helped Indian farmers boost their crop yields, eventually making India self-sufficient in food. It was called the Green Revolution, and farmers were the heroes at the center of it.
And as the people of Atlantic City know better than anyone — Donald Trump cannot do the job for American workers and businesses.
I would have preferred a social insurance plan, says Democratic Sen. Faith Winter, the bill's lead sponsor. Ultimately, you could have a perfect bill that doesn't pass, or you could have a good bill that passes.
The deficit in the 2020 fiscal year topped $3.1 trillion, or 14.9% of GDP.
MARTIN: What have you made of Republicans' response to all this? Lindsey Graham, in particular, has been very careful not to come down too hard on the president about his constant disparaging of your former boss.
KELLY: So why is President Trump tweeting about this now? Do we know?
NPR was invited to the West Wing listening session in late February and was given early details of the child care proposal from Ivanka Trump that is included in the president's 2020 budget.
There has to be intensive oversight, he says. And there have to be ramifications when someone violates the policies that protect the rights of innocent people whose information is collected. It is very unclear now what protects people's privacy once it's collected anywhere along the chain — whether it is a state or local police officer collecting it, whether it is the FBI collecting it or whether it is the intelligence community.
SAGAL: Sen. Booker - Sen. Booker, no offense but as we talk, I'm getting a clear idea of why you're single.
A few years ago, a truck stop near the Jonah Field would have been humming with roughnecks, company bosses, and gas well maintenance crews. Instead, it's been mostly deserted for months, says the manager, Roxanne Kroeger. She is trying to work out how much longer she can hold on: It's very uncertain, nobody knows what's going to happen, now that President Biden's in there.

Plenty of Americans routinely cut it close to the deadline: According to the IRS, last year, 5 million tax returns were sent in on the last day of filing season.
So when you hear, when you hear, while there is no evidence to prove any wrongdoing, this is the most fraudulent thing anybody has, this is a criminal enterprise. This is a criminal enterprise. And the press will say, and I'm sure they won't put any of that on there, because that's no good. And you ever see, while there is no evidence to back President Trump's assertion.
A week ago, the stock market began its dive with a 666-point sell-off after the Labor Department reported that wage growth was picking up. Average hourly wages grew 2.9 percent from a year ago — the largest increase since 2009. Yields for 10-year Treasurys hit four-year highs.
When you have to go to the food bank, there's a lot of pride at stake and people are suffering from that, Cordeiro said. They're getting depressed over that, because all that weight is on them, just like it is on me.
EVANS: So we've seen how that's played out in Virginia. Black Virginians have - they've been 3 1/2 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana crimes for most of the last decade. At the same time, several national studies have shown that they don't use it any more often than white people. Northam and other Democrats say Virginia can address those disparities by learning from other states, and part of that is also learning how to set up the business side of things.

The Biden administration's new climate agenda is forcing a reckoning for states that are dependent on fossil fuels, like Wyoming. Much of its economy — and its state budget — is built on exporting coal, oil and gas to the rest of America. The state is now expected to sue over President Biden's ban on new oil and gas leasing on federal land.
(More protesters interrupt) Thank you...I will say the Bernie Sanders people had far more energy and spirit, I will say.
Trump Urges Harley-Davidson Not To Shift More Production Overseas
Ultimately, House special elections are snapshots in time — and right now Democrats need to be able to prove their opposition to Trump, with protests and marches, isn't just all talk and no results. Winning one of these races would prove they can turn their grass-roots' anti-Trump sentiment into real blowback at the ballot box.
In addition, by a 24-point margin, Americans believe former President Barack Obama was, by far, a more effective leader in comparison to Trump, 58 percent to 34 percent. Among independents, there is an even more pronounced 36-point difference, 65 percent to 29 percent.
Pompeo has been one of President Trump's most loyal allies, and he has remained silent as other Cabinet members, national security advisers and press aides have resigned their position, denouncing the president's role in inciting followers who stormed the Capitol building on Wednesday.

SHAPIRO: ...Keep jobs in the United States.
House Speaker Paul Ryan's office contended the White House and Congress were on the same page.
Of course, there are ethical concerns. Rebecca Kukla of Georgetown University worries about stigma, especially against poor and minority women. If cultural norms do change, she says, there could be a backlash against families with more children than is deemed socially appropriate.
Despite his comments about the need for national unity, the president also forcefully highlighted one of his more divisive comments early in his remarks Tuesday.
That confusion was evident in debates that erupted online. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., noted the decline in the average tax refund. Let's call the President's tax cut what it is: a middle-class tax hike to line the pockets of already wealthy corporations and the 1%, the presidential hopeful wrote on Twitter.
The Fed can grease the wheels of the economy with cheaper credit, and it can help guide it in a better direction, but it can't fix the engine. So when the Fed cut the federal funds rate by a tiny amount, that's why our reaction was basically ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. It's not going to fundamentally fix intractable problems like low investment and productivity growth.
Schwab added that it does not condone hate groups and we take concerns about illegitimate activity by grant recipients seriously. It encouraged anyone with these concerns to contact the IRS or state charity regulators about the activities of charitable organizations.
MONTANARO: Well, Democrats are certainly trying to push to get his tax returns released. Democrats on Capitol Hill have been filing formal requests trying to get those. There's no sign that the president's going to do so. At this point, he said that he's not inclined to do it. But as far as his campaign fundraising goes, he's raised $30 million, most of that from political committees, just $4 million from small donors, which stands in stark contrast with Democrats who are trying to draw a significant share from the grassroots.
While the White House argues faster growth can be sustained, many observers believe the effects are a temporary sugar high that will soon wear off. Growth in the third quarter slowed to 3.4 percent. A preliminary estimate of fourth-quarter growth will be released on Feb. 28.
The student debt crisis is disproportionately impacting borrowers of color and communities of color, Black borrowers in particular, explains Ashley Harrington, senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending. When we talk about cancellation, we have to start there.
Millions of students may find themselves in the same boat as Harvey — saddled with unexpected expenses or pandemic related job losses that impact their ability to pay for college. And a student's financial aid package might not be enough to cover their costs because of the way the federal aid system is set up: The Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA — the form which determines a student's eligibility for financial aid for college — uses tax data from 2019. Unfortunately, the world looked very different back then, pre-pandemic.
The estate tax affects fewer than 1 in 500 estates. Many opponents of the estate tax — who have tended to be Republicans — use death tax as a euphemism. This shows that to the extent that that phrasing helps them, it could be helping them pick people up across the aisle.
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., immediately pressed for that strategy — a sign that Democrats were readying a backup plan. Now that they have decided not to press for it, it's unclear whether another proposal will emerge, or if Democrats will have to press for the wage hike in stand-alone legislation. But even if Democrats in the House pass such a bill, it does not have enough support to overcome a GOP filibuster in the Senate.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the Ways and Means Committee last month that if such a request were to be made, the administration will follow the law and we will protect the president as we would protect any individual taxpayer under their rights.
JACKLEY: That's exactly right. I mean, the United States Supreme Court has estimated that this is costing South Dakota between $48 and $58 million every year, which is a significant hit to our budget.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what's next? Is there anything the state government can do to fix the problems with how the ACA is working in Arizona? Or do Arizonans just wait for it to explode as the president has suggested it will?
But don't believe it. His businesses were failing long before the rest of the town was struggling.
Romney appeared on CNN later Wednesday and laid out the role he will play as a sometimes-Trump critic, if necessary.
The Senate parliamentarian ruled Thursday that the $15 an hour federal minimum wage increase could not be included in the Senate bill because of the limits that are part of budget reconciliation. House Democrats kept the provision in their bill despite that development, but it's expected to be stripped out as the Senate debates the bill this week.
So at some point in order to secure this nomination, you have to start winning more bigger states by wider margins than you've been able to do so far. When do you expect we will begin to see that happen?
Wareham put the onus on campaign manager Danny Diaz, who joined as campaign manager in the summer of 2015. He lacked the temperament, Wareham charged. His major accomplishment prior to being hired was losing the Ken Cuccinelli campaign in Virginia. So he had no successful experience. Though he did have experience.
The Trump administration is refusing to defend key parts of the Affordable Care Act, essentially arguing that federal courts should find the health law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions unconstitutional.
KEITH: That's right. And there are some challenges here. The reconciliation process isn't an easy one. It starts with something that in many years Congress simply doesn't do, which is pass a budget. And in this case, it has to be a budget that both Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin can agree to. Democrats have the narrowest majority possible in the Senate. They can't lose a single Democratic vote if they want to go it alone. And, you know, just an indication that they might face some challenges - Vice President Harris did a bunch of local TV interviews to try to sell this COVID package. And what states was she in? She was, virtually, in West Virginia and Arizona - states with Democratic senators who haven't signed on yet to Biden's $1.9 trillion plan.

These conversations began with the social scientist Francis Fukuyama, who famously proclaimed the end of history just as the Cold War was coming to an end. What Fukuyama meant was that a single form of government — liberal democracy — was on its way to triumph over competing models like communism. A quarter century later, the forms of democracy remain in place around the world. But many are becoming less liberal. Russia has an elected president and parliament but has cracked down on dissent and the press. Turkey has also cracked down on the press, and in a recent democratic vote chose to concentrate power in the hands of one man.

Trump's announcement comes after the worst day for markets since 2008, because of growing fears that the coronavirus will plunge the economy into recession. Trump met on Monday with his task force managing the country's response.
So in the same way that a prosecutor of criminal claims has discretion to determine whether to offer a plea deal, whether or not to pursue a case against somebody who may or may not have committed a crime, the secretary of education can determine not to enforce student debts basically for whatever reason, Herrine says.

The U.S. economy expanded at a solid 2.6 percent rate during the last three months of 2018, but growth was significantly lower than it had been earlier in the year, the government said Thursday.
For the DGA that means isolating casino donations for non-political uses, according to a source at DGA who wasn't authorized to speak publicly about compliance issues. The source also says the timing of casino donations was a coincidence due to a scheduled fundraiser in Las Vegas.
The Georgia secretary of state and pathetic governor of Georgia, have reached, although he says I'm a great president. You know, I sort of maybe have to change. He said the other day, Yes, I do. I disagree with president, but he's been a great president. Good, thanks. Thank you very much.
We head south to check out one of Wholesum's Mexican operations. As we drive across the Nogales border, we pass dozens of 18-wheelers, lined up to cross into the U.S.
The emotional moment was caught by TV cameras and quickly went viral, although it did not ultimately affect Kavanaugh's confirmation or Flake's support for it.
Conditions in Kenya are far from perfect, adds Gina Reiss Wilchins, CEO of ZanaAfrica Foundation. Still, there are lessons in what has been accomplished.
Schumer said the president did not repeat threats he has made in previous meetings with Democrats — that if congressional investigations of him continue, he will not work with Democrats on legislation.

More pressingly, there is a Jan. 19 deadline to pass yet another spending bill to keep the lights on in the government.
There's a lot of talk on Capitol Hill about the tax cuts included in the Republican health plans, but unless you are a frequent user of tanning beds or have personal wealth that puts you in the top 1 percent, you might not feel much effect.
KODJAK: Yeah, well, we have Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Elizabeth Warren who both also co-sponsored Senator Sanders' bill, so the - that Democratic crowd is pretty much all in. You have two so-called moderate billionaire businessmen who are testing the waters, those centrist candidates. Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks - he called this program not American because it would eliminate the health insurance industry. Mike Bloomberg - he says a Medicare-for-all plan would, quote, bankrupt us. So those two potential candidates aren't quite as supportive as the three senators who have already co-sponsored Senator Sanders' bill.

DEUTCH: Well, of course. We don't want to have to go forward on contempt charges. What we do is - what we want is for the full report to be delivered. And I know there will be more discussions today. And I hope we can avoid holding the attorney general of the United States in contempt. But he needs to recognize that Congress is a coequal branch of government and that the House needs this information so that we can do our job and secure our democracy and make sure that no one is above the law.
The tax credit isn't big enough, she says, to be a strong incentive. Besides, having access to paid family leave shouldn't be luck of the draw — it should be available to every employee in the country.

For all of his faith in tax cuts and growth, Ryan could only go so far in our interview.
GINGRICH: Right. And so Dole and I are on the plane. We're going to fly all the way to Israel. We're going to fly all the way back. And in that time period, at some point, we could have had an hour or two to try to make some progress on negotiating. And later on, one of the people who was on the plane wrote a column and said the truth is that Bill Clinton was playing Hearts - that this whole notion that he was too exhausted is baloney, that he was sitting up front playing Hearts.
MCCAIN: Yes. My mother is now 93. I think she was 90 at the time that an excerpt from the first book that Mark Salter and I wrote called Faith Of My Fathers was excerpted in a magazine in Washington. And one of the excerpts that was printed in the magazine was that I was - when I was in prison in Hanoi and I would - being taken from one cell to another, I would yell obscenities at the guards to try to help the morale of my fellow prisoners who might be listening. We were not allowed to communicate with each other. And so some of those obscenities were printed in this excerpt and in the book.
Beyond that trio of more compelling contests, there are two other vacancies still to be voted on. The 23-way California contest to succeed now-state Attorney General Xavier Becerra in California's 34th Congressional District was whittled down April 4, with Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez and Los Angeles Planning Commissioner Robert Lee Ahn advancing to a June 6 runoff.
What followed was a protracted legal battle. Trump's lawyers promptly went to court to block the subpoena's enforcement, arguing that he was immune from criminal investigation as the sitting president. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected that argument by a 7-2 vote in July.
Weld nuts are small but critically important parts. Most are about the size of a silver dollar with a small-threaded tube sticking up. They are welded to a car's body and used to bolt on things like seats and seat belts, so they must be able to hold up against the violent forces unleashed when cars collide or smash into something.
Climate Change Push Fuels Split On Coronavirus Stimulus
I know it's hard to imagine, but there was a time when Democrats and Republicans actually worked together. I know because I did it as First Lady, Senator, and Secretary of State. It's how we created the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers 8 million kids, rebuilt New York after 9/11, and passed a treaty reducing the threat from Russia's nuclear weapons.

Pence remained popular for his first couple of years as governor, but that would not last, according to Christine Matthews, a Republican pollster and president of Bellwether Research Group.
Clinton released the health update hours after rival Donald Trump taped an interview, set to air Thursday, on The Dr. Oz Show where he shared the results of his own physical with controversial television Dr. Mehmet Oz. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook drew a contrast between Clinton's extensive letter from her physician and Trump's way of releasing his health history.
BOLGER: Look, off-year elections have been very difficult for the party in power, and Republicans control everything. And typically, the party that is out of power makes significant pickups.
Orbán's pursuit of Soros and the foreign-funded NGOs started shortly after President Trump took office. Some political observers NPR interviewed said Orbán saw the American leader as an anti-Soros ally and counted on his administration offering little resistance to Budapest's move against organizations linked to the billionaire in Hungary. (The U.S. joined Europe last year in objecting to Hungary's attempt to shut down the Soros-founded Central European University in Budapest. But the EU has been more assertive, launching legal proceedings against Orbán not only over the university but also his government's attacks on NGOs.)
YOUNG: Well, I can't say it's the new normal forever because it may change. Right now, it's normal. And it was a - it's a, again, a result, I think - and I'm very critical of the media because we do not get news anymore. We get opinions. It's opinionated information. And so they don't really look or read or understand that there is another side to the issue. And again, we are a reflection - the Congress is a reflection of the people they represent. That's all we are. And if the public has this feeling we can't work together, the Congress is not going to work together.
One of the things that I'm very aware of, says Gresser, is how immensely the food and restaurant business has changed during the 40 years that I've been involved in the industry — yet how little has changed for women during the same time. We need to expand the conversation about supporting women into leadership.
Last fall, AFC issued a report ranking the existing private school choice programs. There are 50 of them, located in 25 states and Washington, D.C., by AFC's count. AFC included only those programs that explicitly allow students to attend religious schools. DeVos, whose family has long supported causes associated with the Christian religious right, has publicly called education reform a way to advance God's kingdom.
GREENE: Well, thanks for coming in.
Hillary Clinton is spending the day in Florida on what her campaign calls a job tour. That's where she offered a rebuttal to a big speech by Donald Trump today. Trump spoke about his vision for the U.S. economy in Detroit. Clinton calls his plan, which is centered around massive tax reform, a return to trickle-down economics.
KAMENETZ: Briefly - budget cuts. The statewide walkouts took place either in red states like Arizona or swing states like Colorado that have all seen a lot of cuts to public ed. And California, of course, is a blue state, but it also has pretty low funding for public schools, below the national average. And that's especially compared to, you know, the cost of living there, in part because of its property tax laws.
SANDERS: Well, that's a good question. And I think the answer is we reprioritize our willingness to allow three people to own more wealth than the bottom half of America. I think we reprioritize the fact that Trump has given $1.1 trillion in tax breaks to the top 1% and to large private and profitable corporations. Amazon made $10 billion last year - didn't pay a nickel in federal income tax. I think we prioritize the reality that trillions of dollars are being stashed away in the Cayman Islands and other tax havens by large corporations and the wealthy.
And, you know, going back to Beto O'Rourke, you know, he was in the low country before this, the day before, talking with members of the Gullah Geechee Nation, which is a community of slave descendants in South Carolina. So he was hearing their issues firsthand, and he was bringing them up firsthand. You know, a lot of them were talking to him about effects of climate change.

But elections are run by states, and most state legislatures don't seem to be too interested in changing their primaries.
In the 2014 Deutsche Bank speech, she said that Wall Street reform really has to come from the industry itself. In her Goldman Sachs AIMS Alternative Investments Symposium speech the year before, Clinton brought up a similar idea, saying,The people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.
The upshot, Saliba says: We may close at the end of the year.
It is my intention that the Senate will not adjourn until we have passed significant and bold new steps, above and beyond what the House passed, to help our strong nation and our strong underlying economy weather this storm, McConnell said.
It's the wrong plan at the wrong time. If this bill was about direct payments to people and putting shots in the arms and vaccines, you would have strong bipartisan support across this Congress, across this country, he told NPR.
Donald Trump is coming off a week of disastrous headlines and cratering poll numbers. His major economic speech on Monday at the Detroit Economic Club, a vision described by his campaign as Winning the Global Competition, was a chance to turn the page.
U.S. economic growth fell to a 2.1% annual rate in the second quarter — down from a 3.1% pace in the first three months of 2019, the Commerce Department said. But growth came in slightly stronger than many analysts had expected.
As a result, Singh found herself beset by a double whammy of bills from two of the costliest kinds of institutions in America — colleges and hospitals — both with prices that inexorably rise faster than inflation.
But just simply overturning Roe v. Wade would just, as I said, return it to the states. Then we need a great national debate. And then the woman's right to, quote, choose should be balanced obviously against a - the viability of a human life. And I'd be eager to enter into that debate with the pro-choice people with respect.
Why this approach? What informed it?
MARTIN: Yeah, this was a big deal. The House passed its massive $1.5 trillion tax overhaul yesterday. This cuts the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent starting next year and cuts individual tax rates temporarily. Here's House Speaker Paul Ryan.
These are people who work hard but no longer have a voice. I am your voice.

California officials plan to compare their results with the federal census data next year. In the past, some states and cities have tried to challenge the U.S. census numbers with lawsuits or requests for a recount.
4. Is this just about free speech for churches and pastors?
But the question of whether it will prove too stimulative and trigger inflation has raised concerns among other analysts.
GROSS: So the Republicans had stood for repeal and replace. The replacement part never really got drafted even though President Trump had kept promising it's coming soon, a couple of weeks. It never materialized. Do you think that the explanation you just gave of Republicans becoming better at generating outrage than generating legislation and really knowing the art of legislation, do you think that explains in part why replace never got formulated?
HARRIS: And younger people are still at some risk. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention yesterday reported that there have been about a hundred hospitalizations among people aged 20 to 44. There are few deaths in that group, but obviously, health officials want to limit hospitalizations so they can focus on the most seriously ill.
To him, exempting this Russian-owned steel mill from tariffs would be a matter of putting America First.

Since your victory, you have sent out a handful of fundraising emails, and I'm curious how much you have raised off of last night's Michigan win.
HORSLEY: Well, we're not entirely sure. He was kind of short on specifics yesterday. He did promise to say more about the details today after some consultation with lawmakers. But he did float some ideas. You heard him talk there about a payroll tax cut. The White House has also talked about help for industries like airlines and cruise lines that have been very hard hit by the coronavirus outbreak, also small business loans for other businesses that are being affected - and, importantly, some help for workers who don't have sick leave and otherwise might feel economic pressure to keep going to work even if they fall ill, which of course is not what you want if you're trying to slow or stop the spread of the virus.
A big part of that support is the government guarantee of Minimum Support Prices, or MSPs, for 22 staples it considers essential to Indians' nutrition and the agricultural economy. The list includes rice and wheat but not the tomatoes and peppers Sanap grows. A majority of Indian farmers grow crops that are not on that list – and have never enjoyed those price guarantees.
MATTHEWS: I liked that word reign.
INSLEE: It will come in the form of a combination of investment - and we know these investments grow jobs over time and will minimize the economic loss that will otherwise be associated with the climate crisis.
DACA covers a class of immigrants whose presence, seemingly all agree, pose the least, if any, threat and allows them to sign up for honest labor on the condition of continued good behavior, Alsup wrote. This has become an important program for DACA recipients and their families, for the employers who hire them, for our tax treasuries, and for our economy.

Watson notes that big brewers like Anheuser-Busch — which brews Budweiser, Rolling Rock and dozens of other beers — would get some tax relief too. They would stand to get $12 million — which is a lot of money in absolute terms — but in percentage of their tax bill revenue, that's very, very small,  he said.
Chris Zacher is the executive director of Levitt Pavilion Denver, a large amphitheater that holds free concerts for the public. It's a non-profit, so he's used to how long the grant process takes, and is empathetic to the timeline. But he points out that for some venues, the wait is even longer. The SVOG will grant money based on tiers. A business lost 90 percent or more of its revenue gets first dibs on the money. So if applications open on April 1, but a business is on a later tier, Zacher estimates it might not be able to apply until May.

In fact, without dramatic action, climatologists say, the world is on track to hit 4 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century, and worse beyond that. A World Bank report says this must be avoided, and warns of unprecedented heat waves, severe drought and serious impacts on ecosystems and human systems.
Trump Administration Seeks $46 Billion For Agencies To Deal With The Coronavirus
Mariana Chilton, who runs the Center for Hunger Free Communities at Drexel University, doesn't remember Donald Trump saying much about poor people during the presidential campaign, but she does remember a comment he made about a protester who was being removed from one of his rallies.
And they're, in part, right because a number of the items, such as protections for intellectual property, greater access to China's market for U.S. banks and financial institutions, those are items that China had already been working towards and very much want. They want to be more embedded in the international financial system. Instead, a lot of the more intractable, thornier issues - things like China's massive state subsidies to its technology and manufacturing companies that then disadvantage American firms - those issues were left out of this trade truce, and they'll have to be talked about in a so-called phase two trade truce.
TOLSON: Sure. And I think, like Kevin said, everything is subject to investigation. But I think to say that the Trump campaign was in collusion and the campaign was part of this, that's way out there. That's really (laughter) way out there.
Jonathan, having tracked the political process of health care legislation, do you now accept not nearly good enough as a giant step forward in a way that you wouldn't have had you not witnessed the difficulty of the political process of getting Obamacare passed?
During an address of just over an hour — which was interrupted multiple times by protesters — the GOP presidential nominee unveiled a new iteration of his proposal to reshape America's tax system. It has just three tax brackets (one fewer than the tax plan he released in September, which was removed from his website in the past 24 hours), would limit taxes on all forms of business income to 15 percent, would end the estate tax and would exclude childcare expenses from taxation.
That has some looking to Congress for meaningful climate action, since laws passed there have better sticking power and spending power.

If he could talk to Trump, Aguiluz says, here's what he would say.
And a seminal time was when Dennis Hastert became the speaker of the House of Representatives at a time when the majority was a fairly shaky one and, in part to preserve that majority, just opened up this process to let individuals decide how they wanted to allocate huge pots of money. It turned out he benefited himself enormously by making sure that there was a specific exit ramp for a highway in his state of Illinois in his district that was right by property that he owned that increased its value by millions of dollars. Lots of others took advantage of this, and it became a corrupting process. And we saw a big backlash, an attempt to remove most of those earmarks. Now, it's moved back a little bit in the other direction.
Betsy DeVos will not be addressing the upcoming three-day national meeting of the Education Writers Association, as is traditional for education secretaries. The largest annual gathering of journalists who cover education takes place in Washington, D.C., at the end of this month. A spokesman for DeVos told NPR Ed, unfortunately, her schedule is full and she's unavailable this year.
Next week, voters will head to the polls for primaries in Wisconsin, a purple state that swung for President Donald Trump in 2016 and was key to his victory. We went to visit the state last week, and it's clear that the president still looms large over Wisconsin. All you have to do is watch a little local TV and attack ads from both parties.
As a working parent, I can tell you there are only so many months that you can wake up at dawn or work after bedtime in order to get it all done. It's just not sustainable.
1. Which taxes are targeted for repeal?
Marlys Graff and her husband, Dick, usually head to their seasonal home in northern Wisconsin from Titusville, Fla., by early May. Now their plans are on hold. She hopes not to spend the summer in Florida.
ROVNER: Well, you know, it doesn't apply to that many people. It only applies to companies with 50 or more full-time workers. More than 96 percent of those firms already provide health insurance. But still, it has set off a huge cry of outrage, particularly from the law's opponents.
CORNISH: Every problem can be solved. So David Brooks, you looked at this through the lens of Trumpism. Who can solve those problems? What's the role of government in that?
KURTIS: Gary Currier of Oregon City, Ore.
The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens our community. America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed. Immediately after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.
LIASSON: Yes, and certainly everybody would agree. It's good to get along with countries around the world. The problem is that everyone else in the Trump administration acknowledges that Russia interfered in the 2016 election except for the president. The Mueller report said Russia interfered in a, quote, sweeping and systematic fashion. The president has never consistently acknowledged that, except for when he's blaming President Obama for doing nothing about it.
R. SHAHIN: The change in status for teachers came about from what was a palpable contempt for what teachers did by legislators and policymakers because most times, you know, parents and teachers are on the same page. They want to do what's best for the children that are in their charge, which is something I think the - people who have never done it don't understand that link and can't understand why it's so vital that it's a people activity, not a business activity.
MARTIN: What is that? I mean, everyone talks about retraining, but what does that actually mean? How much does it cost?
LIASSON: No. He went home to Vermont. He didn't speak. It's hard to see a path ahead of him given that the states next week are also hard for him, in particular Florida, where his praise for Fidel Castro has created a backlash. But if we've learned anything, there can be big unexpected curves ahead. So this race is not over yet.
It is a breath of fresh air to see leaders in Congress discussing climate solutions that rise to the scale of the challenge, said Aliya Haq, federal policy director for the Climate & Clean Energy Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council in a statement.

The Ministry of Education will work with suppliers to initiate a phased rollout of the program, with period products to become available starting in June for schools that opt in by March.

Orbán has also introduced other dramatic measures to encourage Hungarians to procreate. Last year, he said women who have four or more children will enjoy an income tax waiver for life, and that couples with three or more children are eligible to have certain loans forgiven.
But that all started to change in the 1960s with the election of Democrat John F. Kennedy, a liberal northeasterner; the civil rights movement; and Lyndon Johnson's embrace of it.
My message is that things have to change – and they have to change right now.
The battle over Trump's tax returns — after he was the first president in four decades not to release the annual filings — has been brewing since the 2016 campaign. Once Democrats regained control of the House in last November's midterm elections, trying to seek Trump's taxes to delve into both his personal and business ties and determine whether there could be any foreign financial entanglements has become a key oversight priority.
KEITH: Being able to say he could do something that other presidents couldn't or wouldn't is important to Trump. To hear him tell it, that's why he made sure a provision opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling was inserted into the big tax cut bill. He said he got a call from a friend in the oil business.
KELLY: Carrie, let me turn you to what President Trump is threatening to do, nonetheless.

Meadows has come to be one of Trump's closest allies on the Capitol Hill, speaking with him regularly and helping the president keep Republicans in line. He was a staunch defender during Trump's impeachment trial.

RALPH NORTHAM: One of the early leaders of the federal Drug Enforcement Agency was clear that marijuana laws should be written explicitly to target people of color, and so they were.
Look. All of these things, I think, are having a long-term effect on what we as Americans regard as acceptable. He is changing the norms of our society. And I understand that, you know, if you're a liberal, it's totally horrific. If you're a Trumpian, you want to ignore all this and say it's a matter of style or personality I think it's fundamental. And I think that the first year of the Trump presidency has been shambolic because what we found out is that Donald Trump the candidate turned out not to be that much different from Donald Trump the president.
To begin to repair that safety net, Democrats would give caregivers $300 a month for each child under 6, and $250 a month for older kids — for at least the next year. Romney's benefit would last beyond the one-year window and be more generous for younger kids, $350 a month, while also reaching higher-income families. Because his proposal also cuts other programs, though, economists estimate it could have less overall impact on poverty.
They see you pushing the cart, they look at you funny, he says. He also says he's as unhappy with his situation as any onlooker could be. I haven't showered in about a month, he says. So I don't feel good.
SIMON: And remind us again what the protests are about. They've been going on for so many weeks now.
Harris also brought up her Thursday visit with Washington, D.C., health director Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt to a pharmacy in a predominantly Black neighborhood in the nation's capital. In her Saturday remarks, Harris noted that access to COVID-19 vaccines is often a concern among Black and brown Americans.
President Trump recently weighed in on the controversy with a tweet calling a census without the all important citizenship question meaningless and a waste of the billions the head count costs.
Well, as CNN has pointed out, no major company in America has filed Chapter 11 more often in the last 30 years than Trump's casinos.
Hello and welcome to another edition of NPR Ed's weekly national education news roundup!
I have a list of things that we need in order to be able to provide better social distancing, more safety for teachers, more safety for students, Rickert said. I've been talking to my admin team all year about these things.
Update at 7:00 p.m. ET. Drama On The Floor:
The senior Justice Department official says Durham is expected to resign from his U.S. attorney role but his special counsel appointment will remain in effect.
On Thursday, the ruling United Russia party unanimously approved Mishustin's candidacy. Russia's parliament, the Duma, where the party has a majority, was expected to follow suit later in the day.
GREENE: Scott Horsley, NPR's chief economics correspondent. Scott, thanks so much.
And the corporate lobbyists are actually taking an up or down vote, along with the state legislators, on these bills at ALEC task forces. And then they become models for the nation. And we see them moving, in many instances quite rapidly, once they become an ALEC model.
SIEGEL: Is the Japanese economy, and Japanese society for that matter, enough like ours - allowing for many great differences - that we could with the right or wrong policy choices end up in the Japanese way?
All this means that real solutions are likely to be more complicated than computer experiments.
So now, now that you have heard some of my plans for the economy, ask yourself, what are Donald Trump's plans?
Even Donald J. Trump gave between $100,001 and $250,000 to the foundation.
Now that the Senate has passed its own version of a tax overhaul, lawmakers will work to iron out differences with the House version. The resulting legislation could then be sent to President Trump for his signature.
Calderon used to have a carpentry business but lost it to drinking. His alcoholism cost him his family too, driving away his wife and two adult children. Although he still drinks, he'd like to quit this year. I'm gonna get back on my feet again, he says. Nonetheless, he points out a beer cooler he keeps in a shopping cart hidden behind some plants.
1. National reciprocity for concealed-carry permits
We made history last week, Pete Brownell, the first vice president of the NRA, told the crowd. And I have to tell you it feels great to be on offense again.
54 percent of millennials believe their standard of living will be lower than their parents.
GREENE: All right. I want to bring in NPR's Kelsey Snell, who covers Congress. She's been listening along with us.
ORDOÑEZ: Yes. There's no question at all that he's turning up the temperature on China. It was only January when Trump said China was working very hard and that President Xi was doing a good job - not really now, though. Trump said today, if we had known about it, that this could have been stopped right where it came from. And he very pointedly said, China. And he made those comments while explaining why he's asking Congress for a new trillion-dollar aid package. He said, quote, the world is paying a big price for what China did.
BERNIE SANDERS: Well, thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be with you.
Alongside news, essays and commentary, we also provide our audience with cultural criticism, showcasing works of art and entertainment and analyzing their qualities and merits. Criticism, of course, is inherently opinionated. We reserve our criticism for works of art and entertainment and do not opine on matters we cover in the news.
DEBBIE DINGELL: Gretchen Whitmer is a talented, dedicated governor in the Midwest. And let's be blunt. All roads for the presidential in November go through Michigan.
All those programs require a whole lot of money. The foundation has raised more than $2 billion since 2001, according to The Washington Post.
The first payments were by check, but state prisons have been unable to process the second round of stimulus payments because the IRS distributed the money using debit cards.
Republicans will seek to ensure that no one is worse off, said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., in an interview with a Wisconsin newspaper in early December. The purpose here is to bring relief to people who are suffering from Obamacare so that they can get something better.
Vance also listed among his office's memorable accomplishments the 2017 conviction in the long-unsolved murder case of 6-year-old Etan Patz. Vance wrote to his staff that for each of us, there are cases that speak to us about why we do this work. For me, when I think back on all of the cases of our time together, I keep returning to Etan Patz and his family.
Just 36% of Black Americans and 46% of whites say relations between whites and Blacks are at least somewhat good, according to Gallup. Both figures are the lowest since Gallup began tracking the question 20 years ago. Overall, a majority of Americans, by a 54%-to-44% margin, said relations between Blacks and whites were bad.
And so we've already been paying the costs, except we have not been getting any of the benefit. And so what we're here to say is that government is not just for cleaning up other people's mess, but it's also for building solutions in places where the private sector will not.
Were the GOP tax bill to pass as is, taxpayers and their spouses would get a $300 credit per year, as would families for nonchild dependents — for five years.
Our annual trade deficit in goods with Mexico has risen from close to zero, think of that, in 1993 to almost $60 billion today. Our total trade deficit in goods hit nearly $800 billion last year. Total trade deficit. Almost $800 billion. This is a strike at the heart of Michigan, and our nation as a whole. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000. Detroit is still waiting for Hillary Clinton's apology. She has been a disaster. Obama has been a disaster. I expect Detroit will get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton turns over the 33,000 emails she deleted.
He says the accountability is built in.
They also pressed for six months of loan forgiveness for federal student loans and mortgages, disaster grants for communities forced to shut down, direct assistance from the Small Business Administration for retail and other businesses failing due to drop off because of the outbreak.
Thank you all for being here. This is incredible. Thank you very much. Thank you.
The GameStop rally came after investors saw glimmers of hope for the company this month when the chain changed the makeup of its board of directors.

The world does not organize itself. For 70 years, the United States, under Democratic and Republican presidents, played a leading role in writing the rules, forging the agreements, and animating the institutions that guide relations among nations and advance collective security and prosperity — until Trump.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: This past week, the possibility of softness in the economy has been a focus. And a lot of what you're talking about would take real investment. I have to ask you, at this particular time, what would you have to reprioritize in a weaker economy?
KHALID: It is. Joe Biden won 10 states in Super Tuesday last week, and that was just a remarkable shift in his political fortunes in, frankly, a really mind-bendingly quick amount of time. That gave Biden the lead in delegates. And our last count shows he's now up by 96 delegates. So he's really looking to solidify his front-runner status today and essentially prevent Bernie Sanders from showing that he has a path to a comeback.
I think he's gone from the trenches to the trenches, said Richie Schaefer, a friend of Cohn's and former NYMEX chairman.
LIASSON: Well, this was Donald Trump's first foray into international diplomacy, and it hasn't started out very well. The Mexican president says he canceled the meeting because he's angry that Donald Trump just this week announced his plans to build his long-promised wall with Mexico and insists that Mexico pay for it.
GROSS: One of the practices that is being examined here is waterboarding in which the interrogator basically pours water into the nose and mouth of the person being interrogated, and that person thinks that they are drowning. Although they will be...
KEITH: And maybe I'm wrong about this.
Greg Baylor, senior counsel with the Alliance Defending Freedom, told NPR he supported Trump's stated goals but that the actual text doesn't fully accomplish the promise that Trump made in the Rose Garden.
After Trump finished speaking, as Republicans cheered, she theatrically tore her copy of the address in half. Later, on Twitter, Pelosi called the speech a manifesto of mistruths.
The executive order itself, however, instructs the secretaries of the Treasury, labor, and health and human services to consider issuing amended regulations, consistent with applicable law, to address conscience-based objections to the contraception mandate.
Sixteen states and the District of Columbia have submitted complete state education plans, the Education Department announced. You can see the list here. The plans outline how states will comply with the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, including establishing student growth targets, helping underperforming schools and consulting with stakeholders to finalize plans. The plans are headed for peer review; there is a second deadline for more states to submit in September.
ROMER: It turns out that's pretty much the federal government's view as well. Our tax protester, Larry, and the IRS traded letters for a few years. But eventually, Larry was arrested and hauled into court. Before the trial, Larry agreed to pay the $600,000 in taxes and interest he owed from all those years of not paying, but there was still the question of criminal charges.
But, he says, the problem is when you subsidize heavily the adoption of machines instead of people.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT)
But if they do, it means a much heftier price tag, as yet-another analysis released Monday found. As currently written, the bill would cost around $1.5 trillion. But if Congress extended provisions that expire early, the bill would cost more than $2 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington think tank that promotes smaller deficits.
Pennsylvania's impact fee on natural gas producers raised more money in 2018 to offset the effects of shale development than at any time in the fee's seven-year history, the Public Utility Commission said on Thursday.
Roger Herrera, a retired BP executive and longtime lobbyist for an Alaska group that pushed Congress to open the refuge, said he was hugely disappointed in the results of the sale.
SCOTT GURIAN: The Superfund controls contaminated areas where the original polluters have either run out of money or gone out of business. Without the tax on industry, its budget comes entirely from taxpayers, and environmentalists say the Raritan Bay Slag site is a perfect example of why that alone is not enough.
KODJAK: Anderson agrees with Trump's goal to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but her worries about Medicaid. Trump's plan says, quote, we must review basic options for Medicaid and work with the states to ensure that those who want health care coverage can have it. Anderson says that sounds to him like a huge Medicaid expansion. That's the conservative discussion. Liberals are interpreting Trump in yet another way. Igor Volsky is deputy director of the American Progress Action Fund. He says Trump wants to simply ditch Obamacare.
But it is not - it doesn't help people who, for example, are not on a payroll. The idea of helping people who don't have sick leave so that they don't feel the need to go to work does seem to be one area of potential agreement between the White House and Democrats on the Hill.
Trump says global warming is a hoax, Brown said. I say Donald Trump is a fraud.
The Patient: Divya Singh, a 20-year-old student at Hofstra University.
GREENE: And we should say, Democratic Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, who were once Biden's rivals in the race, joined him onstage.
When the simulation was run as if there had been no change in the tax law, 18 percent of taxpayers, or about 27 million, would have experienced underwithholding and 76 percent would have been overwithheld. In both scenarios, just 6 percent of taxpayers would have the correct amount of withholding.

Justice Dept. To Transition U.S. Attorneys, Sparing 2 Involved In Political Probes
Republicans who loudly criticized the Obama administration for deficit spending are more muted now that the GOP is in control. One of the most prominent ones is Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, who was a vocal deficit hawk when he served in Congress but this week said new deficits could be necessary to achieve higher rates of economic growth.
We will clean up the voter rolls that ensure that every single person who casts a vote is a citizen of our country, a resident of the state in which they vote and their vote is cast in a lawful and honest manner.
Fifteen years after Congress allowed the polluter tax on oil and chemical industries to expire, nearly 1,300 contaminated sites remain on the EPA's Superfund list, awaiting funding to be cleaned up. Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey has introduced a bill to reinstate the tax, and with the support of the Obama administration, it has a good chance of becoming law. Environmentalists say people living near sites are being held hostage because the Superfund has run dry, but those representing the industry argue they're being unfairly blamed. Independent Producer Scott Gurian reports.
Having it done pretty quickly could be an overstatement. Republicans are going to need 60 votes, which now means the support of nine Democrats or independents after Democrat Doug Jones was sworn in Wednesday.
GREENE: We have NPR chief economics correspondent Scott Horsley with us this morning. Hi, Scott.
Pension experts say this is a real conundrum in many places right now: how to fund pension systems that have been starved for decades without giving teachers a retirement plan that is not as secure as Social Security.
But yesterday, another town not under restriction introduced this method of keeping the population at home. We might hear more announcements like this.
SAGAL: You're going to say B - he listed himself as CEO heir apparent on the company's website. I just want to give you a little bit of a trivia that prior to about two days ago, I did not know what a sham was.
Hospital in Massachusetts will be dedicated to treating COVID-19 patients
Buttigieg defended himself on this charge as well during the CNN interview, saying, I'm not a fan of the current campaign finance system, but I'm also insistent that we've got to go into this with all the support we can get. To help make his point, Buttigieg cited how much money President Trump's re-election campaign has raised.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: That's Leah Vukmir. But it gets worse.
His administration will require an unusually robust, muscular form of accountability reporting — tethered to fact and fairness, independent of political pressure.
He says the Republican tax bills would do that. And here's how. Suppose a business could buy a machine to replace three workers, but there's no great cost savings. That means that machine is not a great machine, Acemoglu says. It's fine, but it's marginal.
Well, Donald Trump wants to give trillions in tax breaks to people like himself. I want to invest in our veterans, our kids, and our police officers. You can judge for yourself about our values.
INSKEEP: So one more thing here - Steven Mnuchin, the designate to be treasury secretary...
Democrats had an advantage as high as 11 points at the beginning of February — which exceeded the edge of about 7 to 8 points most analysts believe Democrats need to hit to retake the House, though polling later in the summer may be more predictive. Still, the 5-point edge for Democrats is the same as they held last month.
Station F is privately financed by French telecom billionaire Xavier Niel, who invested about $300 million to acquire and renovate the train depot. Microsoft and Facebook are just a few of the multinational corporations sponsoring incubators here.
Over the past year, job losses have been especially concentrated among single mothers. And with so many school cafeterias still closed and not feeding kids experiencing food insecurity, researchers are seeing alarming levels of child hunger.
Industry analysts say it makes sense for the government to fill the reserve when prices are low, but environmental groups were quick to criticize the move.

Bezos was in the room today, along with Tim Cook of Apple, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, Elon Musk of Tesla and top executives from Microsoft, Oracle, IBM and other tech giants — as well as investor Peter Thiel, one of the few tech leaders who supported Trump's campaign, and who arranged today's meeting. Three of Trump's adult children were also present.
There appear to be many reasons, but the latest one to break through may be how strongly Putin feels the United States had been waging such a campaign against him and Russia.
Many progressives were especially frustrated that Biden was already backing off the wage increase a couple of weeks before the parliamentarian ruled. Well, apparently that's not going to occur because of the rules of the United States Senate, Biden told CBS News last month during a sit-down interview before the Super Bowl. My guess is it will not be in it.
Washington, for the most part, didn't take his proposal seriously at first. I think a lot of people's heads were not yet in the magnitude of the economic problem that coronavirus was going to pose, Furman says. The president's economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, got asked on television what he thought of my idea. He said something like, 'Jason Furman is my friend, but ...' and then said something much more limited needed to happen. On March 11, Furman also reportedly met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other senior Democrats, and they rejected his idea too. (Furman would not comment on the details of the meeting.)
Congress technically has legislative options to counter Trump's tariffs if he moves ahead with them despite opposition, but it would require a somewhat extraordinary move on the part of Republicans to craft legislation cracking down on their own president in an election year. Republicans would also likely need vetoproof majorities in both chambers to have any effect. And any legislative move would also upend orthodoxy on trade policy, which is generally enacted with the view that the president should be given latitude to manage international trade.
GONYEA: Sanders' speech is heavy on issues - Medicare For All, climate change, banning assault weapons, the need for a wealth tax, raising the national minimum wage.
I have never seen anything more craven than Mitch McConnell and what he has done to our democracy. His Republican Party decided that the answer to hardworking Americans' dreams is to slander our African-American president, stoke fear of Muslims, sow hatred of Latinos, insult Asians, and, of course, wage war against women.
The juror who made the complaint said other jurors were talking in the same way too, making general remarks, according to the transcript.
CHANG: OK. That was NPR's Franco Ordoñez, Scott Horsley and Richard Harris. Thanks to all three of you.
Just consider our assets. We have the most dynamic, productive workforce in the world, bar none. We have the most innovative businesses, the top colleges, universities, community colleges, training programs in the world. And the best science and technology. We have enormous capacity for clean energy production. We are resilient, determined, hardworking - there is nothing America can't do if we do it together. And I know this because this is how I was raised. And I don't think Mr. Trump understands any of it. He hasn't offered any credible solutions for the very real economic challenges we face.
Listen: NPR's interview with Michael Anton Listen · 7:00 7:00
During his questioning of Cohen, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said the proof of payments Cohen had brought to lawmakers suggested garden variety financial fraud.
GRAVES: In essence, that was the target of it. But the law was much broader than that. And so while it clearly was targeting those restroom bills or those measures relating to public restrooms, it was much farther than that in terms of discrimination rules within the state of North Carolina, in terms of what cities could do to protect people from discrimination and to ensure equal treatment.
The details of the agreement are still being finalized, but Republicans plan to permanently cut rates for businesses and drop taxes for individuals for eight years.
NPR has reviewed copies of internal interview notes provided by a former campaign aide that include employment through November 2020 with Team Bloomberg (not guaranteed location you are at now).

So far, no elected member of Congress has disclosed testing positive for COVID-19, the illness caused by novel coronavirus. However, at least two Republican senators — Ted Cruz of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida — remain under self-quarantine after exposure to individuals who tested positive. And over recent days, at least four lawmaker offices have disclosed coronavirus exposure.
INSKEEP: So let me ask you about deficits as part of this picture because when we look at the total Trump tax plan, anybody who's scored this has found that it adds trillions to the federal deficit and to the federal debt over time. How big a disadvantage is that in your view?
This economy is not broken, and it does not need Fed action to fix it, he said in a statement. Shepherdson noted that economic growth averaged 2.6% in the first half of the year, topping the 2.4% average for the previous five years.
For women of color looking for advancement in the food industry, it can be even more difficult to find opportunities. In the film, African-American chef Mashama Bailey points out that the building that houses her restaurant was once a segregated bus station: When I came into the building, it was really humbling. I know the people who were in this space — going to ride the bus, sitting in that little tiny back waiting room — did not think that someone like me would be a co-owner or be in this space at all running it.
The AFC awarded Florida's program 26 out of a possible 28 points for accountability. The private schools are required to administer a standardized test of some kind, though not necessarily the state test.
Studies Trump cited offer no proof of such voter fraud. And he also incorrectly claimed it was illegal to be registered in two states; it's not illegal unless someone votes in two states, because often voter rolls are not quickly updated. In fact, it turned out some Trump aides and family members were registered in multiple states.
[Tesla] took the untruth that electric cars are boring and slow, and flipped that and showed the world that electric cars can be exciting and certainly very quick, Scaringe said.
Now let's just look at this for a minute. Donald Trump says he's qualified to be president because of his business record. Now, three weeks ago, he said, and I quote, I'm going to do for the country what I did for my business.
MONKS: They're young people. The way he mobilized the youth in '16 - he's doing it again. That's encouraging to me.
The room is quiet. No one fidgets. Later, a few students say they had no idea the situation was so bad. One says he appreciated the talk but found it terrifying, and hadn't planned on being so shaken before heading off to start the weekend.
DAVIES: Evan Osnos is a staff writer for The New Yorker magazine. We will continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.
SMITH: It's not about the dollar amount; it's making sure that it's going where it's needed. I was one of the few Republicans that supported a direct $2,000 stimulus check, where we voted on at the end of December. So I think that the best COVID bill - and I said this to two White House advisers, along with all the other Republican rankers on the call, early on in the conversation, when we talked to the White House - we would support health care spending and funding and direct checks.

Trump is also spending part of the week fundraising, with events scheduled on the West Coast early in the week.
LIASSON: And around the world, allies like the EU and Canada, who would be hit hardest by these tariffs, say they're going to retaliate. The president tweeted back, saying, fine. If the EU does that, we're going to slap a car tax on them - not sure exactly what he means. But I'll tell you who's happy about this - Democratic rustbelt senators up for re-election. They are thrilled. But the president has now really driven a wedge between his own parts of his own blue-collar base and the Republican Party because agriculture interests - part of Trump's red state base - don't like this. And many small manufacturers who use steel and aluminum also don't like it.
Sad and angry workers gathered at France Telecom offices around the country this week, including its headquarters in Paris.
Even if it succeeds, additional oil leasing and drilling in the refuge will face headwinds, said U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., a longtime drilling opponent.
SHAPIRO: Explain who qualifies. What's the cutoff?
COURIC: Can I - that is super creepy.
To borrow King's imagery in 2017: Which way is the arc of our history bending?
POGGIOLI: Well, the latest figures are from the Civil Protection Agency last night - 2,502 total cases and 79 deaths, and most of them are elderly people with preexisting health issues. And the great majority are from the epicenter of the outbreak, which is in Lombardy, where there's 10 towns with a population of 50,000 that have been total lockdown for nearly two weeks.
You know, in particular, one of the things that he talks about and that other people who talk about this potential campaign is the heartland. It is Ohio. It is those white working class lunch pail Democrats who used to be the core of the Democratic Party who President Trump targeted and won. And Sherrod Brown is somebody who would absolutely try to target those voters again to try to get them back on board.
He suggested that is one of the things he has learned during his first year in office.
The city says it's working to address the drivers' concerns.
KHALID: Brown is highlighting both his progressive credentials and his experience. He's been in Congress longer than most of his fellow Democrats running for president. And his answer was convincing to voters like Sally Helms and her longtime friend Gerri King.
His first year was a mixed bag of legislative accomplishments (tax overhaul) and failures (health care), the book is still out on his foreign policy posture, and the Russia probe continues.

We're dealing with Democrats in Congress, we'll see what can be done, Trump said during an exchange with reporters Thursday at the White House. He said Democrats had included goodies in their bill that have nothing to do with what we're talking about. He did not give details.
At this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community because I'll tell you what. Because the support they've given me, and I'm not sure I totally deserve it, has been so amazing. And has had such a big reason for me being here tonight. True. So true.
Semi-relatedly, while the number of Americans fleeing to Canada may not be skyrocketing right now, the number of Americans who give up their U.S. citizenship each year sure has.
HILLARY CLINTON: It does not help the vast majority of Americans, but it does really well for people already at the top. Well, we're going to turn that upside down. We're going to make the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes for a change.
SIEGEL: There's a commercial on television targeting you from the American Future Fund. It says John Kasich, he's not even a moderate. He embraced Common Core, he expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. He's a tax hiker, I believe, is in one of these. Is it possible that you, as a pragmatic governor of Ohio, are frankly not conservative enough for the primary GOP electorate this time around?
And I must say, I do just love to see how she gets under Donald Trump's thin skin.
FRAYER: So this island is where some of the allegedly embezzled money came from - from taxpayers here. So people are upset. This fraud came to light at the height of the economic crisis here, when ordinary Spaniards were still really struggling. Even now, Spanish unemployment is stuck above 20 percent. I talked to an older woman in a coffee shop this morning who said she's a royalist. She loves Spain's royal family. But she said, just think how rich they are, and they are alleged to have been stealing. The law must apply to everyone equally, she said.
I spent a recent morning with Palantir's director of engineering, Bob McGrew. We walked to Palantir's offices in downtown Palo Alto, Calif., and ran simple errands along the way. He bought a cup of coffee. He withdrew some cash out of a nearby ATM. And while those might seem like two perfectly innocuous stops, they could, in a terrorism investigation, have been signaling much more.
KHALID: There's a slight pause, a few mmm hmms in agreement, and some chuckles. Brown acknowledges the awkwardness but then dives into an explanation.

Trump went even further on Thursday, appearing to side again with Schumer, expressing openness to eliminate the debt ceiling altogether.
So why do some Republicans want to throw a grenade in this system if it's been working? Scott Greenberg, an analyst with the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, says, Tax exempt bonds are probably a relatively inefficient way of subsidizing projects meant to benefit the public.
The president has tasked the team with developing economic policies that will make it very, very clear that we're going to stand by those hardworking Americans, stand by those businesses large and small, Pence said.
I don't know how to explain it because I've been in meetings with him on trade, Thune told reporters. Everybody's been very clear that we think some of the decisions that they're talking about making and policies they're talking about implementing would be very harmful to the economy at a time when it's really taking off.
Trump has praised a plan proposed by Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley and the Senate Finance Committee. But so far, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not endorsed it.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Senator Sanders, like many of your colleagues, you did vote for the 1994 crime bill that is blamed for the mass incarceration of young black men, which you are decrying now. Back then, you said it was a good compromise. Do you regret that vote and take ownership of...
A big part of President Biden's coronavirus relief package is focused on children. The president says he wants to expand the federal child tax credit, which gives families money for each child they have — or at least reduces their taxes.
SAGAL: Hang on a second. Now, you actually - Roxanne, thank you for bringing this up - Sen. Booker, you were one of Town & Country Magazine's Top 40 Bachelors. You were named that. You're a well-known single man about town in Washington. What's it like - what's it like in Washington, you know, when the world is your oyster, you've got no strings attached?
It was an arrangement with the candidate sort of doing a lot of the groundwork, and visiting and talking with people, but the superPAC doing a lot of the media, said Michael Franz, a political scientist at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, and co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks TV advertising in the presidential campaign.
Trump administration officials say the bigger-than-expected numbers are a sign the president's economic agenda is succeeding.
It may be increasingly hard to fool both consumers and college admissions officers. But it's also true that what starts out as giving for the wrong reason may not end up that way.

NPR's Ari Shapiro talks with Indivar Dutta-Gupta of the Georgetown Center on Poverty and Inequality on the expanded child tax credit in the stimulus bill and how it'd reduce poverty among children.
For example, in Bibb County, President Trump was reported to have 29,391 votes at 9:11 p.m. Eastern time, while simultaneously Vice President Joe Biden was reported to have 17,213. Minutes later, just minutes, at the next update, these vote numbers switched with President Trump going way down to 17,000 and Biden going way up to 29,391. And that was very quick, a 12,000 vote switch all in Mr. Biden's favor.
The key engine of growth is going to be that powerful cocktail of both a healthier economy along with fiscal stimulus, said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.

Finally and perhaps most thought provokingly, the economists looked at the effects of minimum wage hikes on the prices of Big Macs. They found that when the minimum wage goes up, the price of a Big Mac goes up too. Ashenfelter says the evidence from increased food prices suggests that basically all of the increase of labor costs gets passed right on to the customers. But because low-wage workers are also usually customers at low-wage establishments, this suggests that any pay raise resulting from a minimum wage increase might not be as great in reality as it looks on paper. In econospeak, the increase in their real wage — that is, their wage after accounting for the price of the stuff they buy — is not as high, because the cost of some of the stuff they buy, such as fast food, goes up too.
KASICH: Well, they're already coming to me. I'm in second place in the polls. If I - and at the beginning of this interview, you pointed out that people are running negative ads against me. They're not running negative ads against me because I'm doing poorly. They're running negative ads against me because I'm doing well. So we just continue to do what we're doing, and I think we're doing very well. And I think we are expanding, we've got a great ground game, good TV ads, and I'm happy with where we are.
President Trump downplayed congressional GOP concerns. I don't think you're going to have a trade war, he said Monday at the White House, where he defended his decision to crack down on imports. People have to understand, our country on trade, has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world whether it's friend or enemy. Everybody.

Our experiences and perspectives are valuable assets to our journalism. We enjoy the right to robust personal lives, yet we accept some unique professional obligations and limitations. Because our words and actions can damage the public's opinion of NPR, we comport ourselves in ways that honor our professional impartiality. We have opinions, like all people. But the public deserves factual reporting and informed analysis without our opinions influencing what they hear or see. So we strive to report and produce stories that transcend our biases and treat all views fairly. We aggressively challenge our own perspectives and pursue a diverse range of others, aiming always to present the truth as completely as we can tell it.
In order to get this through the House and Senate, it is important for Democrats to be at the table ... for us, it's how do we achieve the goal? Gaitan said. And what we said is we're willing to work with whoever to make sure that we're getting good policy through Congress.

Notable Presidential Pardons In American History
Behind closed doors, Manafort defense lawyer Kevin Downing moved unsuccessfully for a mistrial, according to the transcripts, which describe how one of the jurors reported another for allegedly making remarks about the weakness of the defense case before all the testimony had concluded.
The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment that frankly that I have ever seen of anybody in this room has ever watched or seen.
Britain launched a program last January to provide free period products at all state schools and colleges, which officials said has been extended into 2021. And last month, the country eliminated the so-called tampon tax on sanitary products, which had previously been classified as nonessential.
It appears that worries over the trade war and turmoil in the stock markets impacted consumer behavior more than we expected, National Retail Federation President Matthew Shay said in a statement. It's very disappointing that clearly avoidable actions by the government influenced consumer confidence and unnecessarily depressed December retail sales.
The overwhelming number of votes in this race will come from York County, the largest area of the district that's seen a boom as a growing suburb of Charlotte. Former state Rep. Ralph Norman, whose family owns a major real estate development company in the area, already has a base in the area, and he resigned from the Legislature to focus on the race. State House Speaker Pro Tempore Tommy Pope represents part of the district's base in Columbia, too, and he already has name recognition in the state from being the lead prosecutor on the high-profile 1994 case of Susan Smith, the mother who was found guilty of drowning her two young sons in a car.
On Saturday, Trump said on Twitter that this was not the right time.
The Obama administration seems unwilling to test that, even though many experts think Geithner was right to leave the idea on the table. Their argument is that eventually, the government will have to raise taxes to get its fiscal house in order. And the sooner politicians start making that argument, the better.
Similarly, removing combustible engines from the roads or expanding high-speed rail to largely eliminate air travel would require nothing short of revolutionizing transportation.

David Axelrod, a top Democratic strategist and former senior adviser to President Obama, believes Hillary Clinton made the controversy surrounding her health worse by not disclosing her pneumonia diagnosis earlier.
NORTHAM: Oh, sure, yes. There'll be about 180 invited guests to hear Gorsuch's speech. And then, you know, the Trump hotel will make money off the room where it's being held, food, drinks, parking. And this is an expensive hotel, just a - you know, a few blocks from the White House.
All of this said, it remains true that some Democratic voters simply know that the economy has been running along at a steady clip.
Rep. Greg Walden, a Republican from Oregon and the Energy and Commerce Committee's chairman, made draft legislation available to Republicans on the panel Thursday, but they had to read it in a private room and weren't allowed to make copies.
We're going to take care of our American farmers, Trump said, without offering specifics. We're going to take care of our manufacturers and our manufacturing jobs.
LEV PARNAS: It was all about Joe Biden, Hunter Biden. And also, Rudy had a personal thing with the Manafort stuff, the black ledger. And that was another thing that they were looking into, but it was never about corruption.
The measure passed with a simple majority using the budget reconciliation process and despite all present Senate Republicans voting against it.
[Trump is referring to the $400 million dollars flown to the Iranian government by the Obama administration in January, at the same time American prisoners were released from Iran. The money was part of a settlement of a decades-old legal dispute, involving military sales before the Shah was overthrown in 1979. The State Department said it is completely false to say it was a ransom payment, though it coincided with the release of American prisoners. The payment was made in foreign currencies because it's illegal to conduct a transaction with Iran in U.S. dollars under current law. --Arnie Seipel]
SAGAL: And this is interesting. The intern who did it, who led this ring, did it to impress his girlfriend, another intern at NASA. And they didn't just steal the moon rocks. Before they got caught, they made one small step for mankind on top of them.
I think there is probably a more direct correlation to the strength of the U.S. economy than to presidents, said Joel Guberman, a Toronto-based immigration lawyer, in an email to NPR. He said the statistics tell him a different story. It appears that the high is 2008-09. The worst years for the U.S. are the highest exits, while very prosperous years are lower.
We should note that this is not a comprehensive list. And if you're wondering why it's not longer, Winkler says, It's because the NRA has been so successful over the last 40 years in American politics that it's already accomplished almost everything on the list of its agenda items.
The disclosure bolsters the case brought by special counsel Robert Mueller, whose team has been criticized by President Trump and his allies as being filled with angry Democrats conducting a witch hunt.
State and local governments have cut 1.3 million jobs since the pandemic began and have struggled financially as tax revenues declined while costs related to fighting the pandemic surged last year.
I didn't have health insurance for one month last year, in January 2017. Do I owe a penalty for not having health insurance when I file my taxes this spring?
But we've also seen the terrible Obama-Clinton judgment right here for everybody to see in Detroit. Hillary Clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city, and this country, of its jobs and its wealth. She supported Bill Clinton's NAFTA, she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, she supported job-killing trade deal and that was a really bad one with South Korea, and she supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Not now, but very soon if she wins and we can't let her win. Cause that will be a disaster for Detroit and everybody else.
GONYEA: Back at the Manchester rally, in that Saturday night snow, I talked to some Sanders supporters outside. Zachary Merriam as a 23-year-old machinist and labor organizer.
The fall of the neutral rate is a big deal, especially because with rates so low, the Fed currently might not have enough room to cut when the next recession hits. Why after a decade of economic growth, with deficit spending and corporate tax cuts, and with the Fed keeping its foot on the accelerator, are we not seeing more growth?
At the same Tuesday briefing, Vice President Pence said Trump had talked to Senate Republicans and asked for payroll tax relief and measures for hourly workers and small businesses who may not have sick leave plans.
Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims. I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon, and I mean very soon, come to an end.
Another former official, Jaume Matas, told the court that he was interested in keeping Urdangarin and the royal family happy, and therefore awarded contracts illegally to Urdangarin's sports foundation.
KEITH: Yeah. We're expecting to get more details today. But the group in that letter to the president yesterday stressed that their plan includes the amount Biden sought on vaccines, COVID testing and PPE. That's about $160 billion. But besides that, it is much slimmed down. In interviews yesterday, some of the GOP senators indicated their plan has direct payments but smaller amounts and to a more targeted group and a much smaller amount to help schools reopen. And we didn't hear anything so far about state and local aid, which made up about $350 billion of Biden's plan.
Democrats don't exactly disagree. They say they ran and won on a promise to exactly pass these kinds of programs. For Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro that means finally enacting what she calls a federal child allowance that would use the tax code to send families a tax credit as a monthly payment.
You will have an illegitimate president. That's what you'll have. And we can't let that happen.

The crown prince is also pushing some megaprojects, including spending $500 billion to build a futuristic city called NEOM.
GREENE: That's right. In an effort to contain the virus, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte asked the nation's 60 million residents to stay home except for essential work or emergencies. More than 9,000 cases have been confirmed now in Italy, and over 450 people have died.
Spokespeople for departments of correction in New York, Florida, New Mexico and California all acknowledged via emails the challenges posed by the debit card payments. Most have had to send the cards back to the IRS, and have asked for paper check payments.
No longer can we rely on those same people in the media media, and politics, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place.
Also this week, CNN reported that Michael Cohen - that's the former attorney for the president - is ready to testify that Trump knew about that June 2016 meeting with Manafort and Donald Jr. and some Russians offering dirt on Hillary Clinton. And we also learned that Putin and the president will not meet in September because they want to wait until after the Mueller probe is over. So they're planning to exchange visits to each other's capital city next year.
INSKEEP: Let's talk about the rest of what we heard from Kevin Hassett there. When you listen to that forecast of a little better than 3-percent growth, what stands out to you?

Mr. DUVALL: We didn't walk into a darkened room, turn on the lights, flip a switch and have it work. You know, this was something that we tried, you know, some number of times. We were hooked up with a telephone headset and we were talking to each other.
And across industries - think about all the empty flights, canceled classes and conferences and canceled concerts. And then yesterday, the stock market slid so dramatically after the opening bell that it triggered circuit breakers and trading was briefly suspended. After that happened, President Trump said he has plans that will bring Americans at least some economic relief.
Republicans also tried and failed — only because of Sen. John McCain's thumbs-down — to use reconciliation to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
We will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt by making it easier to refinance and repay what you owe as a portion of your income so you never have to pay more than you can afford.

Now, here in Atlantic City and across America, we've got to create more good-paying jobs with good wages. We've got to make the economy work for everyone, everywhere, not just those at the top in some places.
Phrasing matters. One thing we learned is that using the phrase death tax instead of estate tax seems to make people more opposed to that tax — but, interestingly, that effect appears to be by far largest among Democrats.
Short Answer: He's mostly wrong here. It wasn't an infrastructure bill, and plenty was built. However, some money was spent on social programs.
And the crowd cheered him when he said that. And when I talked to people afterwards, many of them agreed. One man said, you know, hey, I don't pay any more taxes that - than I need to.
Trump Fails To Reach Beyond Base As Independents' Disapproval Grows
KIM: Well, the police didn't take any chances this weekend, and they simply sealed off the entire downtown area. They closed metro stations, blocked off sidewalks to pedestrians and really flooded the streets with riot police. So the protesters just changed their tactics and just walked around the city center in large groups of people, though hardly anybody I met wanted to admit that they were protesting since the penalties for unauthorized rallies are really severe. I spoke to one protester. He said his name was Andrei Katkov. He's a 27-year-old manager in a trading company.
The short answer: Unless you're wealthy, probably not.
One reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long-term effects of some of the earliest large-scale cash transfer programs — a series of government assistance schemes that began in Latin America in the late 1990s. Already we're starting to see the first wave of long-term evaluations, says Evans, who is on leave as a lead economist at the World Bank.
KELEMEN: The women came here on a trip organized by the lobbying group Engage Cuba, which is promoting the Obama administration's policy. They haven't had any contact yet with the incoming Trump team and don't know what to expect. They've just been reading his tweets.
However, he did admit to Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., that he has been approached about possible TV, movie or book deals — which he wouldn't rule out accepting at some later point.
Cohen was famously at the center of arranging a payment related to Trump's alleged sexual encounter with adult film star Stormy Daniels, who was paid $130,000 to keep quiet about a claimed 2006 tryst. Trump has denied Daniels' allegation that the two ever had a sexual relationship. Under an agreement between Trump and Cohen, the attorney would pay Daniels and then be reimbursed.
Donald Trump insults, shouts down, and bullies his opponents. He can't even play nice with his friends.
KEITH: ...Record players are cool again. They're back.
The president, however, did not mention that just hours before he was set to deliver his speech the stock market closed by taking a triple-digit hit.

At least nine people in this country have died from the coronavirus and at least 3,000 people worldwide. Now, amid that tragedy, the virus is also causing problems for the global and very globalized economy. Stock markets have been dropping dramatically. Investors do not like uncertainty. And there is a lot about this virus that we don't know yet. In an effort to counter this, the Federal Reserve yesterday cut the U.S. interest rate by half a percentage point. It's the first emergency cut of this magnitude since 2008. That was at the beginning of the financial crisis. Here's Fed Chair Jerome Powell talking yesterday.

What's happening is that business is down, Ceisler tells me. Some city dwellers are going to the suburbs to do their shopping, Ceisler says. They're not just leaving to buy drinks but other groceries too, he says.
There was no hurricane or emergency, but they acted with a tremendous speed to call a special session in order to preempt that measure. And the lawmakers who were going to be considering that preemption bill received only about five minutes to look at the bill before they had to vote on it in committee. And the public was given only 30 minutes to speak out about that measure before that measure was put to a vote. And within nine hours, that bill was passed and signed into law.
The Biden foreign policy agenda will place the United States back at the head of the table, in a position to work with its allies and partners to mobilize collective action on global threats, Biden wrote of his foreign policy approach in Foreign Affairs.
Although Trump has never released his tax returns, The New York Times estimated last year that he has gotten at least $885 million in tax breaks, grants and other subsidies for his properties in the city.
But for now, the group has retracted its plans to sue, given the lack of concrete change in policy.
Trump traveled to Philadelphia to address the GOP congressional retreat, where he delivered a relatively on-message speech promising Obamacare repeal and to crack down on violent crime, and touting his executive actions on immigration and trade.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved, and every hurting family can find healing and hope.
Not surprisingly, Ashenfelter and Jurajda found that McDonald's restaurants raise their wages after a city or state raises its minimum wage. More surprisingly, they found that a substantial fraction of restaurants preserve their pay premiums for workers who were previously earning more than the minimum wage. That is, if a worker was making a dollar more than the old minimum wage, many McDonald's will make sure those workers continue to make a dollar more than the new minimum wage. Ashenfelter says they don't have hard evidence for why this is, but he believes it's because certain restaurants want to offer wages slightly higher than the legal minimum as a way to reduce turnover. Paying above the minimum wage creates a kind of magnet for workers. Overall, the economists found that if the minimum wage goes up by 10%, the average McDonald's restaurant will increase worker wages by about 7%.
These days, transportation accounts for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions. Green New Deal backers say they want more high-speed trains to make airline travel less necessary, and more electric cars and charging stations. But experts warn that changing the existing fleet of cars in the U.S. would be an extraordinary effort.
The House is on track to pass a $1.9 trillion COVID relief package tonight. The bill is filled with Democratic priorities and expected to pass on Democratic votes alone.

NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis is following this story. Hi, Sue.

Among the most prominent, the deal calls for meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources. The ultimate goal is to stop using fossil fuels entirely, Ocasio-Cortez's office told NPR, as well as to transition away from nuclear energy.
We have to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters, and not the other way around. We have to reduce the influence of money in our politics, so that a handful of families and hidden interests can't bankroll our elections – and if our existing approach to campaign finance can't pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution. We've got to make voting easier, not harder, and modernize it for the way we live now. And over the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do.

But if he's going to try to do what he has talked about, which is to keep those two elements while getting rid of the rest of it, that's where you may begin to see that he starts running up against the edge of some of the internal dynamics in Congress because you have parts of, for instance, the Freedom Caucus, which is the far-right elements of the Republican House conference, 40 members or so, who would regard it as a concession, probably a compromise they couldn't accept if he decided to keep Obamacare and simply amended on its details. So that's where you may find that he runs up against that kind of opposition.

TOM SMITH: Good morning. Thank you, Rachel.
Now, your first reaction to this might be duh — but hold on. This conclusion wasn't reached via government tax forms or census data. Instead, it represents the daily movement and behavior of 150,000 people. It's the ground truth of a vast collection of human beings going about their daily lives. Through this weird digital world we have created, all those people were shedding data like dead skin cells. Because of that data, there was a map of the city's economic disparity hiding in trips to buy paper towels or cat food or birthday presents.
The UK's financial transaction tax has been a bit more successful. In 1694, King William III levied a stamp duty on all paper transactions. A version of that levy still exists, taxing many stock trades at 0.5%. Unlike the defunct Swedish tax, it applies to trades of shares of any UK company, regardless where traders are based. A report from Brookings finds the British stamp duty, unlike the Swedish version, has been pretty successful, showing how much policy details matter.
The reason tax credits and subsidies have been so crucial is that they reduce the cost of construction. So the developers, which are often non-profits, can charge less money for the units and that makes them affordable.

And two, abortions are most common among the poorest women among us. So lifting up the poor, it seems to me, is the best way to reduce the number of abortions, not to make it illegal.
Trump has condemned the violence at the Capitol, but he hasn't acknowledged that Biden won legitimately. Barring that, Stevens thinks, the only solution is for voters to reject Republicans just like they rejected Trump.

Not only did we swear in a former son and daughter of the Senate as the president and vice president, but both these former senators skipped the House altogether, McConnell joked with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi present.
When candidates do not fulfill the things that they said they were going to, we remember. So, for instance, George H. W. Bush saying, read my lips, no new taxes, or Barack Obama saying that he would close Guantanamo. But those are really the exception and not the rule based on everything that scholars have learned about the presidency.
Be aware that hospitals generally require proof of your financial circumstances — such as pay stubs or unemployment checks. Even if you have health insurance that covers much of your medical bill, you may still be eligible to have your bill lowered or get on a government insurance program like Medicaid.

I want to circle back to one piece of this package because there's all kinds of initiatives underway. But Scott, you mentioned this idea of sending cash payments directly to Americans. That was something that, initially, the administration had not thrown its weight behind because they were favoring more this payroll tax cut. Scott, why did the administration change its tune on that?
If we simply look at this as being deficit-neutral, you're never going to get the type of tax reform and tax reductions that you need to get to sustain 3 percent economic growth, he told Fox News Sunday.

The Democratic presidential nominee was diagnosed with pneumonia last Friday but didn't disclose the illness until she fell ill during a Sept. 11 memorial service on Sunday, having to leave the service after she became overheated and dehydrated. She took a three-day hiatus from the campaign trail, and is set to return today with a stop in Greensboro, N.C. On Wednesday, Clinton released more information about the pneumonia, which her doctor said she is recovering well from, and her overall health.
President Trump is also a supporter. In his State of the Union address earlier this year, he said, The time has come to pass school choice for American children. It was his only mention of education besides a passing reference to overburdened schools.
KING: So Justin, where are you in the family house, and why are you separated from your wife and kids?
And now journalists are confronted by the prospect of a president who avidly campaigned against them and has promised retribution at a time when many of the nation's most important news organizations can least afford it.
SHAPIRO: Stockton declared bankruptcy five years ago. Right now this city of more than 100,000 people has 1 in 4 people living below the poverty line. By any measure, this is a place that is struggling. Do you imagine that a handout like this could turn those trends around?

Upmanu Lall, director of the Columbia Water Center, says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity, in many cases Day Zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources.
Let's talk about the state of the presidential race. And let's begin with a text for discussion. It comes from NPR's Weekend Edition yesterday, where a group of younger Republicans talked over their party's future. In that talk, Republican strategist Margaret Hoover offered her perspective on the choice between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.
He looked straight at me in the eye, McFaul remembered. And he said, 'We know what you're doing. We know that you're, you know, trying to support the opposition. And we're going to stop you.' 
And there was lots of talk about the presidential race. This meeting took place before the United Steelworkers national office gave its official endorsement to Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Daco himself believes the U.S. economy will grow by 7% this year, while also adding 7 million jobs — a level of growth not seen since about the 1980s.
In collaboration, the different parts of the government would help identify people who are too poor to pay their outstanding debts. Once identified, the people's cases would be fast-tracked through the court, upon which time they would be given other options to payment. Meanwhile, they would be issued court orders stating their sentence has been completed, granting them the right to vote.
The president is prioritizing his meeting with Prime Minister May because we do have a special relationship with the U.K., said Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster.
By doing that, we will lift half of those children living in poverty, out of poverty. And a disproportionate number of children in America who are living in poverty are Black children, Harris said.
Students and faculty at many religious institutions are asked to accept a faith statement outlining the school's views on such matters as evangelical doctrine, scriptural interpretation and human sexuality. Those statements often include a rejection of homosexual activity and a definition of marriage as the union of one man and one woman. Changing attitudes on sexual ethics and civil rights, however, are making it difficult for some schools, even conservative ones, to ensure broad compliance with their strict positions.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: We asked you to call in with your stories about what it's like to be a public school teacher in 2018.
Trump also lags across the board with all age groups, including even older voters. Middle-age voters between the ages of 45 and 59 are nearly evenly split on the president, with 48 percent disapproving and 47 percent approving. But with voters 60 and older, half say they disapprove of the job he has been doing, with 42 percent approving. And of those senior citizens who disapprove, a 39 percent plurality say they strongly disapprove.
GREENE: So if Democrats do go forward with this, I mean, what do we expect from the Department of Justice in terms of responding?
Vilsack says federal agencies like his were largely absent from ribbon cuttings at businesses backed by federal loans or groundbreakings of local infrastructure projects.

But that credit means less tax revenue coming in. It's a trade-off for states; they figure it's worth the lost revenue if a tax break gets more people saving for college.
Bardack also said Clinton is up to date on her vaccinations, including Prevnar and Pneumovax, pneumonia vaccines. Clinton's mammogram and breast ultrasound results have been normal.
In an email statement to NPR, a Cardinal spokesman said the plan to make use of the CARES Act tax provision complies with current federal law which allows the firm to recover previously paid federal taxes.

To stop the spread of infection, officials have shut down schools and universities and have canceled public gatherings such as concerts and sport events.
Connor says she first took note of the provision — and studied it as a means to help borrowers — several years ago, when students began claiming they had been defrauded by their for-profit colleges. Just because something has never been done before isn't an argument for never doing it, Connor says. And it's definitely not an argument that it can't be done.
We're going to pray for a softness of heart from the jurors, Carol Bundy, Cliven's wife, said recently in a video posted to YouTube. The truth will set us free, and the wonderful thing about truth, the beauty about truth is it's so easy to tell.

For a while, their daughter's preschool was closed, so the child had to tag along with Cordeiro to the office. Fixing three meals a day plus snacks was a drag on the family's grocery budget.
The report also suggests that financial insecurity has increased risk aversion among millennials. Only 22 percent of respondents believe starting a company would be the best way to advance their careers. Today's young people see launching startups as too risky given their cash-strapped reality.
One happens on Facebook all the time. Just about all of your friends are posting about the election, nonstop. And there are a few who brag about deleting friends, or who urge friends to unfriend them over their political leanings: Just unfriend me now. Or something like If you can't support candidate X/Y, we don't need to be friends anymore. Or Congrats, if you're reading this, you survived my friend purge! Etc. You know how it goes. This public declaration, if not celebration, of the end of friendships because of politics.
FASO: Not the sales tax. This is really focused on the income tax.
And then on Twitter, there's the public shaming of those who dare disagree with or insult you. (I am guilty of this.) Someone tweets at you with something incendiary, bashing the article you just shared or the point you just made, mocking something you said about politics, calling you stupid. You quote the tweet, maybe sarcastically, to prove it doesn't affect you. But it does! You tweeted it back, to all of your followers. It's an odd cycle. A rebuttal of nasty political exchanges by highlighting nasty political exchanges.
But even then, his later answer made muddier exactly what he meant. Trump went on to say he didn't want to renegotiate but rather wanted to discount or refinance U.S. Treasurys. That could very well mean he still wanted to offer creditors lower rates, said one economist. But there's another reading.

President Biden has made climate change a focus of his first week in office. But it could take years before many of the executive actions he's highlighted to tackle the issue have a noticeable impact.
He's made Trump ties in China and Trump suits in Mexico instead of here in Michigan.
And the pundit class then sort of went wild and said this is the first time - accurately, this is the first time in modern times anyway - that a Supreme Court justice has given a critique of a presidential candidate. And she clearly didn't like that. She clearly then thought about it and said oops.
They might give us health care, he jokes, but the food is still terrible in this country.

I actually spent 13 years of my life working in New York city before deciding I needed a change in lifestyle and came to France, Ko says. And no regret whatsoever in doing that! From a quality of life standpoint, it is huge.
WEAVER: Well, I mean, I do agree with Jen. Look. There is a unity on the Democratic side against this disastrous administration, which has, you know, ripped children from their mothers, which has, at every opportunity, stabbed working-class people of all races in the back. These are the people that Trump promised to champion. And we have candidates who have got to articulate a bold vision about where we go. They need to be clear with voters about what they want to accomplish. You know, they have got to be bold in presenting the type of alternative which the American people can rally around, which will then lead to Democratic success in 2020.
Particularly galling for Meadows and the others in the Freedom Caucus is a sense that Democrats got the best of the deal.

There does seem to be some agreement at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue that the economic threat posed by coronavirus is severe enough to warrant some government action - but not much agreement yet on what that action should be.
Similarly, the idea that if you've got savers who are getting one-tenth of what they used to get on their interest income, they may end up saving more or at least being much more risk averse because they don't know where the money is coming from. We're already seeing that sort of thing in the U.S. right now.
McConnell called for the Senate to support a GOP-drafted bill that includes expanded unemployment insurance, aid for small businesses and loans for large corporations, among other proposals.
[PolitiFact ranked the claim about the lack of a vetting system false. [However, PolitiFact did find that Trump's number is correct as to the increase in refugee admissions proposed by Clinton. Interestingly, about a month ago, Trump said it would be a 500 percent increase. PolitiFact noted that it actually worked out to 550 percent. Trump has adjusted to the higher and more accurate number. [In 2015, the U.S. admitted (per the State Department) 1,682 Syrian refugees. That is well under President Obama's goal. It would be hard to argue that is massive. — Tamara Keith]
Pugh resigned as mayor in May 2019 as allegations of self-dealing in connection with the sale of thousands of copies of her Healthy Holly children's books engulfed her administration.
However, I was talking to voters, and I still talk to voters. And they haven't really made up their mind. You know, we've seen some other numbers come out that show that there's still a large amount of people that are undecided. And we are still so far away from the February 20 primary. That says to me that, hey, there's still plenty of time for people to pick and choose here.

SHARONNE HAPUARACHY: Full-time nurses, full-time librarians, full-time college counselors at every high school. These are not luxuries that we're asking for. These are the basic needs of our students.
Our foreign policy must be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda, but it can't stop there. For even without ISIL, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world – in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in parts of Central America, Africa and Asia. Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks; others will fall victim to ethnic conflict, or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees. The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians. That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn't pass muster on the world stage.
Now here in Atlantic City, you may know about Vera Coking, the widow whose house on Columbia Place — right over there — Donald tried to seize it through eminent domain and turn it into a parking lot for limousines. Thankfully, he lost that fight.

Altogether, Indian farmers have spurred the biggest challenge yet to Modi's rule. They are a powerful constituency the prime minister cannot afford to alienate.
And so I think there's some - a lack of leverage on the issue on - from the Democrat's side that perhaps they enjoyed in previous elections. I also think that some of us feel also that when you're getting into basic, fundamental moral beliefs, it gets a little complicated because you have to respect the views of others even if they are, you know, very strong differences.

It was pulled down from his website in the last 24 hours but can still be found through the internet archive.

That removes nearly 75 million households – over 50% – from the income tax rolls.

He announced this week that he had raised an eye-popping $8.3 million in the race — an unheard of number for a congressional contest in such a short time. But 95 percent of that came from out-of-state donors, with the help of progressive blogs and celebrity endorsements.

CORNISH: Julie, thanks so much for walking us through it.
Not everything has gone well. Two iterations of his travel ban have gotten hung up in the courts; Trump introduced a radical budget that ramps up military spending and cuts almost everything else, but is dead on arrival in Congress; and intraparty fighting is threatening to derail the GOP health care plan.
It was a busy weekend for revelations about Donald Trump. The New York Times published part of an old tax filing. And the Associated Press reported on demeaning comments by Trump about women.

Biden Praises Senate Passage Of 'Desperately Needed' COVID-19 Relief Bill

Can you shed some light on that?
GURIAN: Robert Spiegel points to what look like roundish, rust-colored chunks of rocks. It's slag from the bottom of old blast furnaces that local companies put here in the late '60s and early '70s to build jetties and retaining walls.

Again, great question, says Rieder, but the answer is still no. First, the chances are slim. More to the point, he says, valuing children as a means to an end — be it to cure climate change or, say, provide soldiers for the state — is ethically problematic.
No, no. Number one, let's relax a little bit here. We began at 3 percent in the polls. Since then, we have now won nine states, most of them by very, very large margins. Last night we won Michigan by a point-and-a-half.
Data tracking trending topics and themes on social networks over the course of the campaign show that for the most part, America was less concerned with policy than with everything else. Talkwalker, a social media analytics company, found that the top three political themes across social media platforms during the past year were Trump's comments about women, Clinton's ongoing email scandal, and Trump's refusal to release his tax returns.
The combination of a supply surge and demand decline sent crude prices down by more than half in the last three weeks.

$100 million would enable VHA's Office of Emergency Management to manage the on-going response to coronavirus without risking degradation to other emergency preparedness requirements.
Biden stressed the urgency, noting the more than 500,000 American lives lost to COVID-19, hundreds of small businesses closed, millions of people out of work and families struggling to afford food and rent.
BRENDA DAWKINS: I love his immigration policy. I love his tax reformation.

Member Of Congressional Black Caucus: Trump Has Brought Normalized Racism To White House
But tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead. Don't worry, I've got plenty, from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients. And I'll keep pushing for progress on the work that still needs doing. Fixing a broken immigration system. Protecting our kids from gun violence. Equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the minimum wage. All these things still matter to hardworking families; they are still the right thing to do; and I will not let up until they get done.
New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker would provide financial incentives to encourage local governments to get rid of zoning laws that limit the construction of affordable housing. He would also provide a renters' tax credit, legal assistance for tenants facing eviction and protect against housing discrimination, something he's made part of his personal appeal. When I was a baby, my parents tried to move us into a neighborhood with great public schools, but realtors wouldn't sell us a home because of the color of our skin, Booker recounts in an online campaign video.
Alternatively, Trump could embrace the health care plan promoted by House Speaker Paul Ryan, which starts with repealing the Affordable Care Act. It includes many of the same principles as Trump's plan, but has more details.
Seeing the returns would reveal some key facts about the president's finances, says Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW.
KEITH: And he is one of those 10 senators who sent the letter to Biden asking for an invite. Biden accepted. But they are far apart in terms of what they're talking about accomplishing.
If reducing carbon in the states is a goal, that can be achieved through market mechanisms, Shields said in an email. In fact, our stakeholders have already initiated a discussion on the topic of carbon pricing.
Ex-governor of Illinois Rod Blagojevich was released from federal prison Tuesday evening following a commutation earlier in the day from President Trump that cut short his punishment on corruption charges over his attempt to sell the Senate seat vacated by then-President Barack Obama.

Chairman Kim and I will meet again on Feb. 27th and 28th in Vietnam.
SOMMER: Yeah. I mean, I think it means that the Biden administration is going to have to move faster on climate than really has ever been done. I mean, some of their own numbers say that they need to speed up the adoption of electric cars 22 times faster. Renewable energy would need to be six times faster. What's working in their favor is that some of these trends are already happening. You know, as McCarthy said, renewable energy is more affordable, and coal plants are closing around the country just for economic reasons. So the Biden administration is going to look to speed that process up. And that, you know, as we talked about, is going to probably need to involve Congress.
The airline industry has been one of the hardest hit by the coronavirus, as people and businesses cancel travel plans. In an interview with NPR's Peter O'Dowd on Wednesday, JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes compared the impact to the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
MOORE SHAHIN: I do, and I feel awful sitting here, having had a nice teaching career that I'm now saying, yeah, I told my kid don't be a teacher. But it's true. We were really seeing all the difficulties that were coming - the privatizing of schools, the charter schools that were opening up and taking money away. We had taken huge pay cuts in our last few years of work - more than 10 percent cuts to our pensions, cuts to our health care. And I thought, you know, this kid's going to do four years at U of M. That's a very expensive education, and I'd like him to do something else.
And finally, how can we make our politics reflect what's best in us, and not what's worst?
HASSETT: And the results are in the data.
It's sort of a coordination game that takes place, mostly during the invisible primary, around this broadly acceptable candidate — one that doesn't rankle any one particular faction too much, he added. When a governor says he likes Marco Rubio or doesn't like Ted Cruz, it's not just a signal to the voters; it's a signal to other high-level politicians who themselves will give endorsements.

The U.S. has more than 5,600 cases of the respiratory virus, as of midday Tuesday, and 94 people have died. New York is reporting some 1,700 cases, and Washington state is reporting nearly 1,000.
Several Republican senators have already said they oppose the bill, at least as of now. Senate leaders are aiming for a vote before July 4.
Browder has denied the many Russian allegations against him. And recent reporting by The New York Times suggested there is no merit to Putin's claim that Browder helped orchestrate hundreds of millions in financial support for Clinton's 2016 White House bid. Speaking to NPR on Wednesday, McFaul called the Russian allegations against Browder which have also ensnared McFaul a cockamamie scheme and suggested they were part of Putin's broader conspiratorial fantasies.
DAVIS: If I told you I couldn't finish a 5K today but I'm going to run a marathon this weekend, you might have reason to be skeptical.
COSTA: If you're a vulnerable Republican up for re-election in the Senate, look for them to perhaps start pushing for some kind of hearing or at least more meetings with Merrick Garland because that's one issue that's sitting out there that may help a Republican win over some moderate voters in the coming months.

He is trying to push his home state to think outside the box if fossil fuels really are on their way out. Recently, he started an alternative energy company that aims to recycle waste from landfills or even old defunct oil wells and turn it into gas.
NPR asked him whether he sometimes does or says things just to unsettle the president. He paused.
According to The Wall Street Journal, Zuckerberg at the time said this privately to his team about Cook's jabs against Facebook: We need to inflict pain.
But in order to do so, it would take a significant escalation of manpower and also of resources. But what came clear from my reporting on the subject was that it's a big mistake to assume that it's - this is binary that you either will have the system as it exists today or you would have some completely unimaginable system that Donald Trump has talked about. There is in fact a spectrum in between that Donald Trump could move fairly substantially down the road to achieving his objectives on immigration.
Under the GOP proposals, the top 1 percent — those earning $875,000 a year or more in 2026 — would get an average tax cut of about $40,000 per year, while middle-income people earning about $50,000 to $90,000 would see about a $300 cut, according to Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the center.
And again, all of this is hypothetical — it would be tough to implement and potentially extremely expensive ... if it passed.
Ramsey says hydrogen could be a viable option for decarbonizing shipping and aviation fuel as well as energy-intensive industries such as steel production. Meanwhile, countries around the world have already launched pilot projects to test hydrogen blends in the gas pipes serving homes and businesses — just as NW Natural aims to do.
Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore and that's what this is all about. And to use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with: We will stop the steal. Today I will lay out just some of the evidence proving that we won this election and we won it by a landslide. This was not a close election.
He portrayed Clinton as a person who knows about the problems of the middle class and who has always been in public life. Hillary gets it, he said. Biden also referenced the history Clinton would make if she is elected president.
Massachusetts Democrat Richard Neal, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, is requesting six years of Trump's personal tax returns and the returns for some of his businesses for the years 2013-2018. Neal argues that Congress, and his committee in particular, need to conduct oversight of the IRS, including its policy of auditing the tax returns of sitting presidents.
More Americans will be writing a check to the IRS in April because their employers are not withholding enough from their paychecks following the new tax law, the Government Accountability Office says in a new report.
That is when Republicans used to believe in building America and putting Americans to work. That is what we are going to do again.
Media will not show the magnitude of this crowd. Even I, when I turned on today, I looked, and I saw thousands of people here. But you don't see hundreds of thousands of people behind you because they don't want to show that.
What's more, as they learned in last week's special-election loss in a Georgia House race, making the election too much about Trump isn't necessarily a silver bullet, either.
SIMON: And the situation has gotten much more serious today suddenly...
GREENE: NPR lead political editor Domenico Montanaro. Thanks, Domenico.
Now, I confess, I confess, it is true, I can be a little wonky. But I have this old-fashioned idea. If you're running for president, you should say what you want to do and how you will get it done.
I think the effect certainly could be dramatic, said Kathryn DePalo-Gould, a political science professor at Florida International University. Some of these other counties, including some of these very, very red counties who had huge turnouts for Trump in 2016, could be missing out on some of these felons.
Bigger businesses have purchasing power to wrangle a favorable deal with an insurance company. Smaller ones don't, leaving many restaurateurs in a perilous position, says Paul Ginsburg, an economist who directs the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy. It's pressures like these that fuel these restaurateurs' support for Medicare for All, even though the cost and financing of such a plan are still just pencil sketches.

A History Of Presidential Tax Returns
SNELL: Yeah, absolutely. Democrats had been trying to send their base, their voters, the message that they are willing to be tough on this administration and trying to send the administration the message that they don't get to set the terms for how Democrats are going to investigate the Trump administration. They want to be able to make it clear that they aren't going to let them set the terms and let them decide who will answer questions and who will not.

Ultimately, Lightfoot won in all 50 wards and garnered 74% of the vote over Preckwinkle's 26%, a margin not seen in Chicago since Mayor Richard M. Daley.
But Cohn appears to have lost an internal struggle over steel and aluminum tariffs to the administration's protectionist wing, led by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and trade adviser Peter Navarro.
We can both stimulate the economy ... and we can lay the foundation for a lower-carbon future, says economist Michael Greenstone, who served as the Chief Economist for President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.
There were cries that it was an unlawful crackdown on possible rivals and that it could scare off investors. But Saudi economist Motasher Almurshed says the move was hugely popular with ordinary Saudis.
Then, Bloomberg abandoned his plans to form a new independent entity and announced that he would instead give $18 million to the Democratic National Committee for the party's battleground states program, and he transferred the leases for some campaign offices to state parties. In a memo at that time, Bloomberg's campaign said that even though it had considered forming an independent group, this race is too important to have many competing groups with good intentions but that are not coordinated and united in strategy and execution.
It has now been almost 10 months since Pineau-Chaisson got sick, yet she is still dealing with a series of devastating ailments. She says she has memory problems, body pain, heart palpitations, depression and chronic fatigue.

But the data is evidence that, for whatever reason, the establishment (whatever it is) is everywhere right now. Google Trends data likewise suggests a sizable spike for the search terms Republican establishment and political establishment (just searching the establishment may be too vague, as it also relates to searches of the Establishment clause of the Constitution).
Few of those sellers use his work with permission. Instead of legally licensing Sedlik's pictures — which include a haunting 1989 portrait of jazz legend Miles Davis — they pull images off the Internet and slap them on products quickly bought from printing companies such as Red Bubble and Café Press. While strangers profit from his work, Sedlik doesn't see a dime. There's little, he says, he can do to protect himself.
Andre Williams hadn't cast a ballot since he voted for Barack Obama in 2008.
COHN: Definitely. You know, when I started writing on health care, you know, back in the late 1990s and coming to this and seeing all the problems of our health care system, you know, of course, your mind starts to think, well, what kind of system should we have? And if you care about universal health care, if you think health care should be a right like it is in the rest of the world, you think, well, we need a system like that. And so your standard is getting to that system, some kind of national health insurance system where everybody is covered and no one really faces the prospect of financial hardship because they've gotten sick.
And yet, when she imagines raising a child, Ferorelli says she can't help but envision the nightmare scenarios that have dogged her since she first heard the term global warming in elementary school.
But it was perhaps predictable that it would end this way. There was only so long that the Kentucky Republican — and the establishment wing of the party he represents — could try to ride the tiger that is Trump.
In a 2012 post at Latino Rebels, site founder and digital media director of NPR's Latino USA Julio Ricardo Varela employed the term after Vice President Biden scolded Mitt Romney for not revealing more of his tax records. He wants you to show your papers, but he won't show us his, Biden said in a speech to the National Council of La Raza. Given the Obama administration's deportation record and unfulfilled promises on immigration reform, Varela wrote, Biden's remarks were just another case of classic Hispandering.

BOLGER: The best thing that can happen for Republicans is to pass legislation like tax reform and get things done as opposed to kind of getting bogged down on sideshows like Twitter. It is something that more and more people see as not presidential, and ultimately, that could end up hurting him and Republicans.

But there are still risks, Biggs says. For one, many teachers don't spend a full career in the classroom, and some states' pension plans take a decade before teachers see any real benefit.
LIASSON: Yes, and this was really interesting. The White House press secretary said that Trump is considering an import tax from all goods imported from Mexico to the U.S. to pay for the wall. Now, this is already part of the House Republicans' comprehensive tax reform plan. They want to tax imports instead of exports. And Trump hinted at this idea when he talked to the Republican Congress members today.

I think it's just a straight-up red line, said Stevens. This is so much greater than any differences over tax policy or trade policy. It's a fundamental belief in whether or not you want to continue the American experiment. A large portion of the Republican Party has decided they are for democracy if that means they win, and they're against it if it means they lose. Which is to say, you don't believe in democracy.
Tonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied – and every politician who has denied them – to listen very, very closely to the words I am about to say.

The city of Seattle faces a big decision today - whether or not to go ahead with a $75 million tax on jobs. City Council members want the money for affordable housing and to address homelessness. But corporations, including Amazon and even the mayor, are warning the City Council not to move forward with this tax. From member station KUOW in Seattle, Carolyn Adolph reports.
In the '70s and '80s, it was originally used by leftists kind of to make fun of themselves, Holliday explains. By the time it entered the mainstream in the '90s, everybody was using it as sort of an attack. It wasn't any longer in the community that it originated in. And then I think we're seeing the same thing kind of with 'cancel.'

His words are horrific, but his policies are damaging. And the wreckage that he has done to the government, even without congressional involvement, is, to me, far more important. You know, attacking NFL players, I mean, that was egregious. But doing what he's done policy wise is far, far more significant and dangerous to our communities.
--No BAT, man: Part of how House Speaker Paul Ryan wanted to pay for this (and it would still only be part) was through what's formally called a border-adjustment tax, or BAT. It's basically an import tax. But the Trump administration's early embrace of the BAT landed them in political hot water. Why? An import tax would mean a lot of things Americans buy at grocery and retail stores would go up.

Hours later, new press secretary Sean Spicer made his first appearance in the White House briefing room to double down on those falsehoods about crowd size. He cited wrong numbers for Metro usage in D.C. and also falsely said that floor coverings used for the first time on the National Mall made photos show where there were gaps, when in fact such coverings had been used before. After delivering his fiery broadside, Spicer left without taking any questions.

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: A senior White House official was briefing reporters on President Trump's decision to meet with Kim Jong Un. When he was asked why Trump would break with diplomatic precedent and agree to the meeting without a series of lower-level negotiations to lay the groundwork first - his answer? - Trump was elected in part because he's willing to take approaches very, very different from past presidents. And those past presidents often seemed to be on his mind in a particular way. Take Trump's decision late last year to formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

As Washington debates sending checks to Americans and increasing the minimum wage, a new study offers evidence for how such policies could help eliminate poverty. Obviously, giving more money to people without much money helps them with money problems. But the study adds to a growing body of research that says that money really does help workers earn more money.
ROBERTS: Well, Richard Nixon's were the first. Nixon didn't initially turn over his returns voluntarily. They were leaked by someone in the IRS.

RASCOE: What stood out to me was how aggressive Joe Biden was. And to me, this was one of the first debates where he really seemed to act as if he were the front-runner. In the other ones, especially in that first one, which, I think most people agreed, was not a strong performance for Joe Biden, he kind of leaned back a bit. But in this one, he was aggressive. There were moments - and really just trying to set the tone instead of just responding.
FRED SHIELDS: (As narrator) This year, thanks to Hitler and Hirohito, taxes are higher than ever before. Will you have enough money on hand to meet your payments when they fall due?
INSKEEP: OK. There will be much more to report through the day as we learn more details of the president's proposed $850 billion stimulus package, not to mention counterproposals from Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill. And NPR chief economics correspondent Scott Horsley will be with us throughout all of it.
Where we need to be targeting really is a net-zero carbon economy by about 2050, which itself is an enormous challenge and will require reductions in carbon emissions much faster than have been achieved historically, he said. 2030 might be a little bit early to be targeting.

DeVos won't speak at education writers' conference
So with the drug industry, the original idea was they wanted - there's a whole series of things they wanted to do. They wanted to spend less on drugs through Medicare and Medicaid. And there was talk of - you know, there was talk of having the government start to negotiate prices directly with the drug companies, which is something that happens in other places in the world. And the drug industry basically came back and said, look, we will - we're OK with you paying us less somewhat through Medicare and Medicaid, but we're not going to accept the kind of reductions you want. And by the way, no way we're going to accept government negotiation of prices. If you do that, we're done. And not only are we done, but you can look forward to us using our war chest to finance advertisements against this legislation. And we'll tell every senator and congressman who listens to us - which is, by the way, most of Congress - to oppose this bill. And your bill will be dead just as surely as the past ones were.

Silicon Valley and Wall Street are shrinking. Corporations and the people who work in them are relocating because of the pandemic and a change in the tax laws that makes states like Texas and Florida more attractive places to set up shop. Florida officials believe it's a trend that will reshape their local economies. Here's NPR's Greg Allen.
Still, diversion is hard to prove, unless investigators are tipped off and know to check the thousands of hours of surveillance videos that licensed growers are required to keep.
SINGLETARY: So if you haven't filed a return and you're eligible for this money, go ahead and do an EZ return. You can go to irs.gov. There's Free File. Do not respond to any telephone calls or text messages or emails. You will not be contacted that way for this money. It's coming through the IRS. If you receive Social Security, you'll get it just like you get your Social Security check. There is nothing that you have to do other than file your tax return if you haven't filed one. If you have lost your job or had a disruption to your income, save this money for the necessities - for your rent, your utilities, food. Don't put it on debt. Don't put it on your credit card. Pause that. Call your lenders, say I can't pay 'cause you want to use this money for the things that you need right now. Let's worry about your credit and debt later, when you've got some more financial freedom.
I don't expect I'm going to have a source of income when I'm in federal penitentiary, Cohen said.
Even in 1968, there was frustration over the word's meaning. Writing 13 years later, Fairlie observed that his idea had grown in popularity and spread across the Atlantic — and he mourned that it had, in his opinion, lost its meaning, thanks to weekend columnists who decided to abandon 'the solid and the concrete' that grounded weekday journalism.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's reporter Will Stone. He's part of a reporting partnership between NPR, Kaiser Health News and member station KJZZ.
Secular stagnation does have an upside, actually: Low interest rates mean it's supercheap to borrow. That includes for the government. Not only that, but the government might be able to rack up big deficits and give us tons of cheap credit and not cause runaway inflation. That's why respected folks like the former chief economist of the IMF, Olivier Blanchard, are discarding the old rules and saying that deficits don't matter like they used to.
JIMMY GOMEZ: If they get away with it, that means less money going into the Treasury. That means less money for programs that will help deal with the fallout of the opioid crisis.
He started work on a gas-powered eco-sports car 10 years ago. But the auto world was changing: Uber was disrupting mobility, Google launched its self-driving car project, and another ambitious entrepreneur, Elon Musk, started bringing electric cars into the mainstream.
SHAPIRO: You seem kind of sanguine about the idea that there are two people you will find highly distasteful on the presidential ballot this November. Are you cool with that?
So, I have made a pledge. I will not raise taxes on the middle class, but we are going to raise taxes on corporations and the wealthy.
I will propose a new plan to dramatically simplify tax filing for small businesses. Right now, the smallest businesses, the kind that my dad had, cause it was a really small business, spend 20 times more per employee to prepare their taxes compared to their larger companies. It should be as easy as printing out a bank statement.
As of late Wednesday local time, South Korea had carried out more than 136,000 tests for the coronavirus.
That will have wide-ranging implications for your small copyright holders, small creators, your songwriter, your artists, your authors, your blogger, your YouTuber, Kupferschmid continues. This isn't about the big movie studios or the big record labels. They have enough money, enough lawyers. They can go to federal court when they're ripped off.
Paid family leave won't only make life easier for moms and dads — it will also keep skilled, talented Americans in the workforce and grow our economy. That's why every other advanced economy already offers it. But again, Trump's against it.
Student debt is not a burden for everyone. Economist Looney points out that many borrowers who took out loans to get a bachelor's degree are able to pay down that debt. And research shows that more than a third of student debt is owed by the top 20% of income holders in the U.S.
SAGAL: So the journal says that the survey has found that 46 percent - almost half of Apple Watch users - have used their nose as a, quote, input device.
When you make the case to voters for three consecutive election cycles that the only ingredients needed for repealing Obamacare are a Republican Congress and control of the White House, the pressure is on to deliver, Madden reiterated.
Trump taped an interview on Wednesday with controversial TV host Dr. Mehmet Oz, set to air this afternoon, where the two discussed his recent physical examination, but the results haven't been released widely. And he has yet to release his tax returns, as is the custom for presidential candidates.
[T]his Thursday we are launching the first-ever government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.
Trump explained the travel restrictions will be adjusted subject to conditions on the ground.
This time, because of the coronavirus pandemic and security concerns, the Mall is shut down — as is much of downtown Washington, D.C.
And so you have this technical reality, which is that for many cities, their power derives from the state. And the states can take it away unless there are specific rules within the Constitution or the statutes that protect those cities. But the reality is that we have relied on cities to provide a whole network of laws and rules and to enact an array of democratically-enacted measures that govern all sorts of aspects of our daily lives. And that's the norm. And this effort to try to take away city power is not the norm - certainly not the modern norm.

Voters in three cities in California passed ballot measures to place a one cent-per-ounce tax on sodas and other sugar-sweetened beverages, a move aimed at tackling obesity.
HORSLEY: Yeah. And that's a contrast to what happened earlier this week when the market really rallied on a promise of a rescue package from the White House. But when investors actually saw what the president is offering last night, they were clearly disappointed - too little, too late and too little detail. He's talking about low-interest loans for affected businesses, maybe postponing next month's tax deadline - most importantly, perhaps, help for workers who don't have sick leave and are forced to stay home so they don't miss a paycheck. But again, we're waiting to see the details of how that might be accomplished.
It was no secret that most of Silicon Valley backed Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential election, and Trump openly feuded with some tech companies during the campaign. He called for a boycott of Apple because of its refusal to help the government unlock an iPhone used by the San Bernardino shooter last December, and he also called on Apple to make its iPhones in the U.S.
That's our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we're partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace.
Then a year ago, the coronavirus pandemic hit. Some IRS offices temporarily closed, the filing deadline for 2019 taxes was extended to July, and the IRS is still behind in processing those returns.
CHANG: You've argued that Trump has been able to drive the news cycle day after day. How has he been able to do that in your opinion?
For more moderate candidates, talking about big topics like inequality can also open the door to conversations that might appeal more to centrists. At a town hall ahead of the Iowa caucuses, Joe Biden used the Trump tax cuts to talk about fiscal responsibility.
Change has always challenged the status quo, Murdock says. So we need to do our best to try to steward that and try to direct the change in a way that helps people to make the shift.
FASO: Well, they actually worked with us. Kevin Brady, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, was under a lot of fiscal constraint because they've chosen to do this tax cut bill through a budget reconciliation process, which, candidly, causes you to be twisted into a pretzel - trying to conform the fiscal ramifications of that tax cut over a 10-year period to very strict financial guideposts. And it's very difficult to fit this tax reform into this reconciliation. So that's one flaw, I think, in this process.

TOLSON: If you really talk to people outside of all of it, they really don't care, and they're turning it off. And what they really care about is the big-picture things and how it affects them, you know, how it affects their day to day. And we're all caught up in - is he contradicting himself? Look, we contradict ourselves every day. We say one thing. We do another. The next day comes, and we feel differently about it. And I understand that we put the president in this position where he has to be perfect or be consistent. I understand that. But at some level, we need to be a little bit more gracious.

if you add up all of Trump's ideas – from cutting taxes for the wealthy and corporations to starting a trade war with China to deporting millions of hard-working immigrants — the result would be a loss of 3.4 million jobs.

HARARI: One concern is the rise of authoritarian regimes and dictatorships. Emergencies are notorious for that. People are afraid for their lives. The economy is collapsing, so people are - wish that there would be some strong leader who knows everything and can take care of us. And we see it happening in some places around the world, like Hungary, to some extent in my home country of Israel. So we could go in an authoritarian direction, even in a totalitarian direction because there is now this need, this cry to monitor everything, to surveil everything. And we could see the introduction of new surveillance systems even in democracies which will not go away once the emergency is over.
A new CBO score on the bill is expected Monday or Tuesday. By the end of next week, there is likely to be a key procedural vote. That would put things on track for a final vote the following week.
DAVIS: It also gave lawmakers on Capitol Hill, particularly Democrats, something to point to to say they were responding to this - right? - that they're calling for an investigation.

Compared with other wealthy nations, the United States does little to reduce child poverty.

Addressing inequality is a top priority for her. That includes her LIFT the Middle Class Act, a tax cut plan that would give families making less than $100,000 annually a credit of up to $500 a month, saying that when we lift up the economic status of families, neighborhoods thrive, society thrives. All of us benefit. She is also taking on the controversial idea of reparations, which would provide a form of compensation to those harmed by past discrimination, such as slavery and Jim Crow.
INSKEEP: As you know, Congresswoman, one reason that people who are politically conservative are skeptical of efforts to combat climate change is that it sounds to them like it requires massive government intervention, which they just don't like. Are you prepared to put on the table that, yes, actually, they're right, what this requires is massive government intervention?

Because I know for some people that really does affect the ability to experience pleasure.

It found that the middle 20 percent of earners would see their after-tax incomes go up by 1.8 percent under Trump's plan. The next 20 percent upward would see an increase of 2.2 percent, and the top 20 percent would see their incomes jump by 6.6 percent. At the very highest levels, among the top 0.1 percent, after-tax incomes would rise by 14.2 percent. Long story short: The higher the income group, the bigger the tax break in general.

[Politicians concerned about student debt love to quote six-figure student debt totals like this one. Those are troubling, but they are far from the norm. According to the College Board, only about 4 percent of student loan borrowers have balances of over $100,000, while a plurality — 39 percent — have balances under $10,000. And debtors with the lowest balances tend to default more often than the biggest borrowers, according to one recent New York Fed analysis. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

I think this goes back to something we talked about earlier, Dave, that's important, which is will Donald Trump do the things that he says he did as a candidate - because part of the reason why presidents end up doing the things that they said they would is often not because they absolutely wanted to do those things. It's because the internal dynamics of the presidency are such that if they don't do the things they campaigned on, well, then they begin to lose credibility with Congress and with the public. And so they almost get driven into these policy cul-de-sacs where they have to go ahead with things. You know, they have to sort of achieve the thing that they said they would otherwise it hurts their ability to do other things.
It will only happen if we fix our politics.

Some liberal House Democrats, particularly those representing larger cities with higher living costs, have argued in the past that lower phaseouts for the checks discriminate against single parents in those areas. So far, none has explicitly weighed in on the bill.
What you're seeing with this trend of preemption is basically trying to make the state - the state's low standard the only standard and to prevent the type of experimentation that has made our democracy thrive where states have been the laboratories of experimentation and so have cities.

So it's going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars. And they're estimating it could take more than a decade to rebuild it.

Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel frequently criticized for alleged overreach by then-President Bill Clinton, never utilized search warrants, two members of the team told NPR. Neither did the special counsel investigating the leak of a CIA operative's identity in the George W.

This Upside Down economy was the product, Hansen said, of a shriveling population, the closing of the frontier and the maturing of industries. The economy had basically grown up. There was nowhere left to go. This situation depressed economic demand and, in particular, demand for investment: factories, machines, houses, cubicles and other stuff (capital) that expands the economy.

[This is Clinton's strongest language yet about the trade deal she called a gold standard when she was secretary of state in the Obama administration. At the time, the trade pact was in the early stages of negotiations. For the first several months of her campaign, Clinton resisted taking a position on TPP, saying the deal was still being negotiated. She finally weighed in last October, a week before the first Democratic debate, saying she couldn't support it in its current form. Many progressives are suspicious that, like President Obama did, she would soften her opposition to the trade deal if she is elected. Donald Trump has also charged that Clinton fully intends to sign off on TPP if she is president. Clinton has held firm in her opposition, but in an interview a close political ally of hers seemed to confirm the suspicions, saying she would likely implement it as president. The campaign moved immediately to tamp that down and Clinton in this speech was unequivocal — perhaps because she had to be. -Tamara Keith]

Contrary to the stereotype of the 'welfare queen,' the employment and labor force participation rates of single mothers increased thanks to the child allowance, as did employment rates of educated married women, reads one analysis from the Niskanen Center, a libertarian think tank.

In the 1940s, if you were flying from New York City to London or Paris you would find yourself making a pit stop for fuel on the western coast of Ireland. The Shannon airport at the time wasn't much to look at, but the passengers arriving there were movie stars and celebrities, basically the super rich. And the people of Shannon realized pretty quickly that they needed to upgrade the local amenities for their wealthy clientele. They hired a man named Brendan O'Regan to make it happen.

Who Benefits From Donald Trump's Tax Plan?
GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: As a candidate, Donald Trump said he wouldn't release his tax returns because he was being audited by the IRS. When pressed on the issue, he said he doesn't think most Americans care. Yesterday, in Washington, New York and dozens of other cities, protesters loudly said that's not the case.
DUTTA-GUPTA: Yeah, this idea has been around for decades. Plenty of our peer countries - wealthy countries in Europe, even Canada and elsewhere - have had a child allowance or child benefit. I think there's growing appreciation for the fact that when people don't have earnings from work, it's not necessarily their fault. Right now, we are arguably 12 million jobs short of where we would have been had the pandemic not hit. We have not seen a labor market this weak in generations.

I'm an American citizen. I would not benefit from immigration reform, but I'm passionately in favor of it, not just because of the impact to the economy and the country in general, but because I do think that it's a respect issue.

We live in a time of extraordinary change – change that's reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet and our place in the world. It's change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families.

And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate.

The tax-credit structure is especially significant when considering what could happen under DeVos in the Trump administration, because it could be a way to promote school choice on a federal level without writing big checks.

The workaround involved the organization opting out of the mandate and sending a letter to the government informing them of that decision. At that point, the federal government would step in to cover the contraception instead. (Some religious groups have claimed the law requires coverage of abortion-inducing drugs called abortifacients as well as contraception. But as NPR has reported, the overwhelming medical and scientific consensus is that none of the mandated contraceptive methods cause abortions.)
RO KHANNA: It's a huge obstacle, I mean, in terms of not having early polling places, not allowing same-day registration, not allowing so many people to come and vote who didn't have IDs.

Many of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have backed paid leave and President Donald Trump's budget envisioned a paid family leave program. Congress is now considering the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act that would provide workers up to 12 weeks of partial income for family leave regardless of the company's size, funded through a payroll tax of 2 cents per $10 in wages. Congress passed a bill last year that will grant 12 weeks of paid family leave to federal employees, beginning in October.

LIASSON: That's right. He is very active in campaigning for Republican candidates. This weekend, he tweeted some more attacks on Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democrats in the House. And this really tells you a lot about the Republicans' message strategy in this campaign. They start out in almost every one of these special elections with a positive message about the economy and about tax cuts. And when that doesn't work - because the tax cuts are getting less and less popular - they have reverted to a negative message, trying to disqualify their Democratic opponents, which is what incumbents do who don't have a positive story to tell or at least one that voters are buying, which is remarkable considering how good the economy is doing.

A small stream of attendees is currently being led around the protest. Currently there have been no arrests or detentions. Democracy Spring is a collective that wants to get dark money out of politics, have publicly funded elections and abolish superdelegates.
And the term has a Cold War reference for a reason. Deploying that plan would result in potentially ever-escalating power moves by the parties that threatens to completely blow up the rules of the Senate forever.

Clinton also spoke of the rigged system in another 2014 speech to Deutsche Bank, saying, If the perception is that somehow the game is rigged, that should be a problem for all of us, and we have to be willing to make that absolutely clear.
The American Rescue Plan has been a priority of the Biden administration, and is poised to deliver a fresh round of financial assistance to individuals, families, schools and businesses hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Measures include $1,400 direct payments, an extension of supplemental unemployment benefits, an increase to the child tax credit and financial support for state and local governments, schools and public health efforts.
An African-American law dean named Wilhelmina Reuben-Cooke praised Gene Patterson, a legendary Southern editor, for his leadership at The Atlanta Constitution, which chronicled the battle for civil rights despite opposition from segregationists. Reuben-Cooke said her family knew that the paper would not ignore the fate of Georgia's black residents in the 1960s.
Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn't deny Sputnik was up there. We didn't argue about the science, or shrink our research and development budget. We built a space program almost overnight, and twelve years later, we were walking on the moon.
Trump also asserted that people were pouring in from regions in the Middle East and that he will suspend immigration from some areas. These are stupid refugee programs created by stupid politicians, he charged.
He's also instructing the Small Business Administration to offer more low-cost loans to businesses affected by the outbreak, much as the SBA would do in the case of a natural disaster. And again, he's asking Congress for more money - $50 billion more - to expand that assistance. He suggested that the April 15 tax filing deadline could be postponed to give affected workers and businesses more time and also just to keep more money out there flowing around the economy. And he renewed his call for a payroll tax cut.
The Senate will have just over two weeks to make changes to the bill before current federal unemployment benefits expire on March 14. No Republicans in the Senate are expected to support the legislation, having balked at the price tag.

The president invited Rush Limbaugh, the popular conservative talk-radio host, to attend his address. Limbaugh had just announced a day earlier that he was diagnosed with advanced-stage lung cancer.
In its latest form, Trump's tax plan does reduce taxes for the middle class, but not in particular. In fact, it's much kinder to the highest-income Americans than to anyone else, according to an October analysis from the Tax Policy Center.
One reason for this mindset, says Renzo Guinto, a Filipino physician and a member of The Lancet Planetary Health's editorial board, is the colonial roots of tropical medicine. In the colonial era, European researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers — not the people living in those places — from getting sick.
Rose believes the CASE Act may violate the Constitution's separation between judicial and governing branches, by putting a court system inside the Library of Congress (which is part of Congress) and could lead to a cottage industry of lawsuits aimed at people who don't even know they're infringing.
KIM: He's saying there's a demand in Russian society for change. And he went on to lay out a whole raft of amendments to the Russian constitution, which include giving the Russian parliament more power and limiting the number of terms of the next Russian president. Analysts are already saying this is the end of what Russians call the country's super-presidential form of government.
The least a society can do is to say we may not be able to cure you, we may not be able to make you better, but the very least we're going to make sure that, you know, you don't have to worry about going bankrupt, paying your bills. And we don't do that as a society. Now, other societies do that. And, you know, until we get to that point, I imagine I'll keep writing about this.
Thaler, who teaches at the University of Chicago, said most people don't know within $10 what their paycheck is. So a slight increase would have gone unnoticed. On the other hand, he said, people use withholding and the expected refunds as a de facto savings plan.
Former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen and Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn won their party's nominations for the U.S. Senate in Tennessee. People went to the polls on Thursday to vote in both local and statewide elections, and in the gubernatorial race former Nashville Mayor Karl Dean, a Democrat, and businessman Bill Lee, a Republican, captured their party's nominations.
Members generally agree that the public has a right to see the tax entanglements of a president. Things get trickier when it comes to who should be demanding those returns and how quickly they should force what is likely to be a confrontation with the administration over the issue.
And I will veto — I will veto any effort to weaken protections for consumers. And while we're at it, we are going to finally make Wall Street, big corporations, and the superwealthy do more that's not only fair in terms of paying taxes, but which is right. Because we can use that money to make these big, bold investments that help us build a stronger economy for decades to come.

The architects of the legislation, they felt like they had structured it in a way that basically, you know, the money was siphoned off. And, you know, money that came from the government couldn't be used to actually pay for abortion. But a group of Democratic House members said, no, that wasn't good enough. And she basically had to say, fine. We'll give you this restriction that threatened to make abortion very unavailable for people buying private insurance. She did not want to do it. Some of her closest allies did not want to do it. But she basically said to them, we have to make this deal because if we don't, this bill doesn't pass.

Early polls have shown Warren in a strong position if she entered what's expected to be a wide open 2020 Democratic presidential primary field, so it's possible she'll be taking that fight to states like Iowa or New Hampshire early next year.
GREENE: So when Republicans did the same thing to President Obama's attorney general, Eric Holder, I mean, the Obama White House at the time said that a vote like this was political theater instead of actually doing real oversight. I mean, is this vote really as valuable as trying to get the full, unredacted Mueller report and do other types of oversight in different ways?
Sex has to do with identity and your gender and with who you are, says Christine Guzman, the Title IX coordinator at Azusa Pacific University in California, so if there's a student who is feeling discriminated against because of their gender, then, yes, absolutely, I'm going to apply that law.
Barbara talks about breastfeeding and butchering at the same time, and it always gets a laugh from the audience, says Jordan. But at the same time, there's something vulgar about that. You get a sense from the women in the audience, no matter what industry they work in, that yes, that's the way it is. That's how you keep your job.

You know, that is - it's hard for Congress to move quickly, particularly on something this big. So I would not expect that it would happen this week. It really depends on how quickly the White House and Republicans can come together and then how quickly they can get Democrats on board once they've gotten themselves together. So there's a process yet to be done.
It creates more opportunity for non-nuclear resources to take advantage of tier 3 credits — potentially giving a bigger boost to renewable sources.
$1.9 Trillion COVID-19 Relief Package Likely To Pass In House On Democrat Votes Alone
An analysis by Avalere Health and McKinsey of an earlier draft of the bill, which contained many of the same provisions, concluded that it would lead to millions of people losing coverage.
MARTIN: Puneet, I have to give you a chance to respond to that. I mean, as a person who is both a business person yourself and also a person who's been a conservative for your adult life, I mean, how do you respond to that?
MCCAIN: Oh, absolutely, particularly when we went from an escalation, a dramatic escalation - remember; when the Gulf of Tonkin incident took place, there was a relatively small number of American troops on the ground in Vietnam. And it dramatically escalated and - as did the conflict. Congress should have revisited it on numerous occasions, in my view.
Compare that to my record. In a recent New York Post article by Steve Cuozzo, How Donald Trump Helped Save New York City, the paper writes that I – and this is a direct quote in other words, it's not from me (crowd interruption) thank you...it's all very well planned out – and this is a direct quote that basically Donald Trump waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park so dangerous and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out...then almost by sheer force of will — [he] rode to the rescue. Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kickstarting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up on for dead.
MARTIN: The federal government is going to provide some economic relief - right? People are going to see as much as $1,200 in their bank accounts. Understanding that every household is different and the needs are different, what's your best guidance on what to do with that money?
A lot of the stuff on IRS form 1040 — the basic tax form — is straightforward enough. But there are a few lines that you look at and say: What is that? And how did it get on my tax form?
MARTIN: So not happy with the current situation, wanting change, unsure what that would be. We should note he didn't want to give his first name - or his full name, rather, for fear of reprisals.
KEITH: Yeah. Yeah. I think she was almost trying to say, like, we can fight amongst ourselves, but really, we should just fight the other guy - maybe the one behind the curtain.

MARTIN: Well, speaking of those comments, I mean, over the course of the year, and even before that during the campaign, there were many remarks and tweets and policy proposals aimed at a lot of groups, you know - Mexicans, Mexican-Americans, Muslims, Muslim-Americans. And a lot of these comments have sparked commentary. But it's only after those comments about those countries that that he is reported to have made - and he denies that he said that - but it is after that that many people, including some of your colleagues, have said that they believe that he's racist, that he harbors racist views. They've been very blunt about that over the course of the week. And I'd like to ask you. And I think you may have already answered that. Do you think that that's true?
The Affordable Care Act requires that health insurance plans cover contraception as part of preventive care for women, at no cost to the employee.
The budget envisions $135 billion in savings for prescription drugs in the Medicare program, Vought said, a signal that the White House hopes Congress can agree on a plan to lower drug prices. The House passed a bill in December, which the White House promptly rejected.
MARTIN: What is his North Star? Like, what's his reason for being in office to begin with? I was thinking - I was reading - Alec MacGillis wrote a biography of McConnell called The Cynic: The Political Education of Mitch McConnell. He writes about going to the archives at the University of Louisville and finding a sort of shrine to his political career. He says what struck him was there was really nothing about any governing accomplishments. It was all about memorabilia from election victories, like, elections that he won from, you know, high school on. So why is he in public life to begin with? What's his goal?
Carrots for the poor, sticks for the rich
Update at 8:23 p.m. ET. Gabby Giffords:
Federal Judge Temporarily Blocks Trump's Decision To End DACA
These aren't hard and fast, though; outlets from the liberal ThinkProgress to conservative radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh, are making the argument that Rubio is not moderate. Likewise, if establishment refers to spending time among Washington's political elite, then Cruz — former clerk for Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist, policy adviser to George W. Bush and a former director of the Federal Trade Commission's Office of Policy Planning — would have to be establishment. But because of how Cruz acts toward the powers that be in Washington, no one uses establishment to describe Cruz.
We should also add a new tax on multi-millionaires... crack down on tax gaming by corporations... and close the carried interest loophole – something I've been calling for years.
Hillary Clinton will never withdraw from TPP. She is bought, controlled and paid-for by her donors and special interests. One hundred percent. Because my only interest is the American people, I have previously laid out a detailed 7-point plan for trade reform, available on my website. It includes strong protections against currency manipulation, big problem, tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods, and it includes a total renegotiation of NAFTA, which is a disaster for our country. A total renegotiation. If we don't get a better deal, we will walk away.
DAVIS: You know, the irony here is taking the wage hike out of the bill probably has made it easier to get it through the Senate because there had been resistance to it from more moderate Democrats, like Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who are otherwise on board for the package. So without it, the bill appears to be on a glide path to a vote next week. It'll probably have to go back to the House for a final vote. There's no indication any Republican's going to vote for it, so it's probably going to be a squeaker on a 50-50 margin and require Vice President Harris' vote to break the tie. Democrats want to get it to Biden by March 14 because that's when current extended unemployment benefits expire.
GREENE: So during past presidential elections it's been pretty standard for major party nominees to release their tax returns.
A cash-balance plan shifts more risk and uncertainty onto workers — in a state where teachers don't have a safety net. Unlike the old plan, there is also no protection to keep lawmakers from cutting state benefits down the road.
AUBREY: Now, Donald Trump has taken heat for a few comments he made this week, including the comment that President Obama is, quote, the founder of ISIS.
The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families programs affects about 1.5 million families, and Liasson reports:

LIASSON: The race is leaning to Hillary Clinton right now. The polls are getting bad and worse for Donald Trump. He's slipping nationally and in battleground states. He's losing support in red states like Georgia and Utah. He's losing support among groups he should be able to take for granted like Republican women. In the latest ABC poll, Clinton has almost 50 percent support from independents. That's a group Romney won in 2012, and that's despite the fact that her numbers on honesty and trustworthiness have not moved. They're still terrible. So the changes in the polls are because Donald Trump has had a bad week.
Update at 7:07 p.m. ET. Excerpts From Obama's Speech:
Melvin Capital and Citron were caught in what's known as a short squeeze, forcing the funds to buy more GameStop stock to cover their losses, which ended up driving the stock price even higher. This has happened before, most famously with Tesla stock.
Trump said in last year's address that he campaigned on core promises on trade, infrastructure, health care, prescription drug pricing, immigration and an America First foreign policy. Related to those core promises, he pledged to do or asked Congress to do more than a dozen specific things in 2019. There has been movement on more than half of his goals in the past year, and roughly a third of the specific promises listed below were accomplished.
The mania has gone global, whipsawing stocks from Amsterdam to Sydney, Bloomberg reported. In Europe, short-seller favorites including Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield jumped 20% or more. E-commerce giant Rakuten Inc. and baby-care goods maker Pigeon Corp. climbed at least 6.9% in Tokyo on Thursday.
STEIN: Yeah, you know, schools should be pretty safe by next fall. Kids will probably still be wearing masks. But the hope is no more slogging through school on laptops at the kitchen table for most kids. I talked about this with Jennifer Nuzzo at Johns Hopkins. She's also feeling optimistic. Her son is 7 years old.
And Right to Rise USA didn't act as if it was hurting for cash — at least not until this month. An NPR analysis of federal data shows the superPAC's TV spending peaked last October at $18 million, then again last month at $29 million. In February, TV spending fell to barely $5 million.

Biden has set a goal of making the U.S. carbon neutral by 2050, which will require steeper emissions cuts than the U.S. has ever achieved. To reach it, coal power would have to wane into a footnote, replaced by renewables like solar and wind. Most cars would run on batteries, instead of gas. He has also emphasized investing in communities that are hardest hit, both communities of color that bear the highest pollution burden and those that depend on disappearing fossil fuel jobs.
My pledge reads: I'M WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
Giuliani has told NPR that Trump discussed a possible pardon earlier this summer, but he said the president agreed not to move forward with the idea.
But there was a sense that she needed a big debate night to keep her campaign afloat. The question that remains for me is, is this strong debate performance enough to help her win Nevada? Does it really stop Bernie Sanders' momentum? And if it doesn't, then I'm still unclear what the effect overall is for her.
A House Democratic counter proposal increases overall aid to more than $60 billion and includes direct cash grants to airlines and contractors, but those payments would have to subsidize workers, keeping them on the payroll, to prevent layoffs and furloughs.
Manafort's lawyers were undeterred. They contended that the case shouldn't go forward. Eventually, the judge questioned every juror about whether he or she had conducted premature deliberations and had already made up his or her mind about the case.
Some landowners agree to that, while others negotiate a lease that prohibits it, says attorney John McFarland, who represents landowners with the Texas-based law firm Graves, Dougherty, Hearon and Moody. Many others sign leases that don't address it at all. Even when possible deductions are addressed, McFarland says, the lease language can be vague. That leaves room for a gas company to take deductions even if a landowner objects.
The proposal included slashing foreign aid by 21%. Budget chief Russell Vought said the White House wants to boost funding for the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation while cutting other types of foreign aid.
As the Democrats' primary process begins to wind down, the big question on a lot of people's mind is, what does Bernie Sanders want?

We'll have to move heaven and earth to get more people vaccinated, Biden said. To mobilize more medical teams to get shots in people's arms, to increase vaccine supply, and to get it out the door as fast as possible.
Week In Politics: Sessions Recuses Himself From Campaign Investigations
Flexibility, freedom, uncertainty, insecurity. These are the words contract workers use to describe their jobs. These impermanent jobs are now built into the fabric of America's working life. They have become a new normal. NPR talked to dozens of contract workers around the country; their jobs, salaries and locations vary greatly, but all touch on similar themes in their experiences.
In his conversation with NPR, Anton was a bit more gentle in his description of the world situation. His new boss, he says, views Britain's exit from the European Union as both a hopeful sign and as a reassertion of nationalist sentiment.
GONYEA: Well, she talked about the need for the biggest investment in the nation's infrastructure since World War II - creating jobs, fixing roads and bridges and water and sewage systems and modernizing the electric grid. She also said that she will reach out to small businesses because Clinton says that's where most of the new and sustained job creation just has to come from. And in the process, she says she will reach out across the aisle to work with Republicans on all of that. And Clinton did say something today - did do something, rather, today that she's been doing frequently on the trail. Before the rally, she visited a small business. Today, it was a brewery, 3 Daughters Brewery in St. Petersburg.
From sports drinks to sodas to fruit-flavored drinks, today's children are drinking their age in these sugary drinks each week. Reducing consumption will improve rates of diabetes, heart disease and tooth decay, Brown concluded.
The Senate proposal is broadly similar to the bill passed by House Republicans last month, with a few notable differences. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been criticized for drafting the bill in secret with just a dozen Republican Senate colleagues, says the proposal — which he calls a discussion draft — will stabilize insurance markets, strengthen Medicaid and cut costs to consumers.
BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Yeah, that's right, Rachel. So Johnson & Johnson's obviously the name brand company here. These other three, Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen and McKesson worked more behind the scenes. They're these really big corporations that earned huge profits distributing highly addictive opioid medications, and now they face this wave of lawsuits tied to that business. We know from financial filings that the companies are close to a settlement that would resolve all that. Here's Cardinal Health CEO Michael Kaufmann speaking to investors last month.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Dave Podurgiel and Jojo Burgess of Washington County, Pa., thank you both so very much.
My grandfather was an engineer and toolmaker and had the technologic know-how, and my grandmother supplied the money, so, I mean this was, yah, a dream team, yah, says Yvonne Schmittenberg. She's a petite woman with long blond hair; an unusual CEO in a male-dominated industry.
Democrats are also asking for more money for hospitals and more generous unemployment benefits for laid-off workers — proposals that, if included, would balloon the cost of the package even more.
At a rally in January, Trump said, My first day, there's no more gun-free zones. He was talking about schools and military bases. He later clarified his position on schools, saying that school resource officers or teachers should be allowed to carry them. He has not publicly changed his opinion on military bases.

President Trump says emergency action will be taken to provide financial relief for workers who are ill, quarantined, or caring for others due to the coronavirus. What does that relief look like?
6 Surprising And Emotional Moments From Trump's State Of The Union Address
For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They've allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives, Trump said.
Dr. Elie Saliba, a pediatric orthopedic surgeon, also worries about long-term erosion as he gives a visitor a tour of a special center for children with cerebral palsy in the sprawling Hospital of Bhannes Hospitality Center for Charity Sisters compound in Bikfaya, an hour's drive from Beirut.
Stock markets in Europe and Asia were also down sharply.
Editor's note: In investigative stories by NPR, the Red Cross was criticized for poorly managed projects, questionable spending and dubious claims of success after the earthquake in Haiti and Superstorm Sandy. The Red Cross has defended its record. Addressing concerns about the Red Cross role in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, a spokesperson told NPR: We respect donor intent and assure Americans that all donations raised for Hurricane Harvey relief efforts will enable the Red Cross to prepare for, respond to and help people recover from this specific disaster.
It's the same story when it comes to health care.
I fill out the paperwork, and I notify the infringer that I'd like to do that, he says. Then the Copyright Office also notifies the infringer that I've filed something. And then the infringer can say... 'No, I don't want to be in small claims.' 
ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: (As himself) Do you believe that we - in terms of the United States - need to pay a hundred cents on the dollar or do you think there's actually ways that we could renegotiate that debt?
Trump reshuffled the National Security Council, elevating controversial chief strategist Steve Bannon to be a permanent member of the Principals Committee, giving him equal billing with other Cabinet-level officials. The director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who are typically permanent members, will now only attend when pertinent issues are being discussed.

The House also passed a so-called reconciliation measure on a 220 to 211 vote that makes significant changes to the main health care bill. Thirty-three Democrats voted against the bill, along with 178 Republicans. That measure heads to the Senate, which is expected to begin debate within days.

Looking at poverty, regardless of geography, research released last year from progressive-leaning Center on Budget Policy Priorities found that child poverty in the United States fell to a record low in 2016, to 15.6 percent. That's down from 28.4 percent in 1967.
We have overwhelming pride in this great country and we have it deep in our souls. Together, we are determined to defend and preserve government of the people, by the people and for the people.
We're having to fix a problem that four weeks ago, nobody thought would be a problem, Trump said.
DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Thank you, Steve.
KURTZLEBEN: Well, the answer to that is that polls are a snapshot. They show you how things are, but they show you how they are right now. And that's important. Polls are to be believed, but they're not predictive of election day. So what I mean by that is that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are in very different places right now.
The Obamacare replacement Price proposed included offering tax credits starting at $1,200 a year to allow people to buy health insurance, boosting the use of tax-advantaged health savings accounts and limiting the tax deduction companies take for providing health insurance to workers.
The department would receive $21 million for additional information technology requirements and telework support, also including increased cybersecurity costs.

Sometimes, when people ask me why on earth I left Italy, a beautiful country I'm lucky enough to call home, I drop a few numbers. Italy's youth unemployment rate – the rate of people under 25 years old looking for a job and not finding it – is 28.6% as of the last quarter of 2019, according to Eurostat, the European Statistical Office. By comparison, in November 2019 the Eurozone's youth unemployment rate overall was 15.6%. Here in the U.S. it's about 8%.
And this may be the easiest shorthand for what it means to be establishment: who leads in endorsements? The top endorsement-getters on the Republican side (who are still in the race, that is) have been Rubio, Bush and John Kasich. On the Democratic side, it's Clinton, by a gargantuan margin.
GINGRICH: Well, because nobody's tired enough. I mean, you know, Pelosi's feeling her oats. She's a brand-new, first re-elected speaker since Sam Rayburn in 1954. So she has no reason right now to be reasonable. Schumer, basically, is tied to her. He is the tail on the kite, and she's the kite. And Trump is genuinely determined to protect the southern border.
In Congress there are child care bills from Democrats in both the House and the Senate designed to stimulate growth in child care availability, defray costs for families that can't afford it and pay providers a living wage. The price tags on these plans run tens of billions of dollars each year, vastly more than the White House proposal.
SIMON: Well, it's a very interesting problem because - look, I'm an ex-civil rights worker, actually, from the '60s. And if Donald Trump were, in my view, a racist, I'd be running the other way like a madman. I don't think he's really a racist. What - how - Trump does have a problem, however. And it's a kind of a signal-to-ground problem. Everything he's ever done is of such importance to him that he responds automatically and rapidly and often hostilely. I don't think he's really so much a racist as he is this hot-flash person who's got to learn to cool down because part of being a president is staying calm.

It allows the state attorneys general to bring civil actions on behalf of the residents of the state to compel compliance, in addition to the standard enforcement abilities of the Federal Trade Commission, she says.
Medicare-for-all is not going to happen legislatively in the next couple years, says Heather Howard, who directs Princeton University's State Health and Value Strategies program and is working closely with some of the states. In the meantime, states are saying, 'What about Medicaid-for-more?'

Leading candidates for president have tried to channel that frustration when they talk about trade in communities around the country.
Jacoby says the IRS will get some help in the bill, an infusion of $1.4 billion, to modernize the agency's 50-year-old software platform.
Capping a year of legislative activity and ending decades of Democratic frustration, the House on Sunday passed a bill that would extend health care coverage to more than 30 million Americans.
Likewise, some of the more progressive economic policies — universal health care and a job guarantee, for example — while popular among some Democrats, would also be very difficult to implement and transition into.
Many of the issues that they're focusing on right now are ones that they're able to claim moral authority around as young people, says Taft. That includes topics such as climate change and gun violence, which young people can address from personal experience, like the students at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., who captured the world's attention after the shooting at their school.
The idea of equal sacrifice is one key argument proponents of progressivity use to back up their ideas, as Thoma wrote in a 2015 article.

Other drivers are making the tough choice to take a financial hit.
Now, on top of that, for domestic consumers, you have a lot of entertainment, sporting events, big gatherings of all kinds that have been canceled or postpone. Obviously, a highlight, NBA - or lowlight; the NBA announcing last night that it's suspending its season. That means less going out to bars and restaurants, less spending money. Might be a silver lining for Netflix and Amazon, but it's a hit for the broader economy. And, you know, hospitality has been a really strong sector, adding tens of thousands of jobs in recent months. This could really change that around.
These are all causes I've worked on for decades. I believe they point to a fundamental truth about our economy. It may seem zero-sum when you're competing for a job, a promotion, or a contract – someone wins and someone loses. But that's not the full picture. If you step back, you'll see that we really are all in this together.
COLEMAN: Scott, let's begin with the EPA administrator. Why is Scott Pruitt under scrutiny?
In a matter of hours on Jan. 6, the Republican Party went from shrugging off its loss of the White House to a party in crisis.
Well, best I can tell he has no credible strategy for creating jobs and maybe we shouldn't expect better from someone whose most famous words are you're fired.
FOWLER: And, Mary Louise, I would add here in Georgia, at least, it all goes back to 2018, when the then-secretary of state Brian Kemp ran for governor against voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams, a rematch that's likely expected in 2022.
CAMPBELL: Thomas is president of the state's largest teachers union and in 2018 marched with tens of thousands in support of a statewide teacher strike sparked in part because of low pay.
I was working as an investment banker, which I liked a lot, she says. But blood is thicker than water, and after all, I was very much tempted by the entrepreneurial challenge, yes.
It takes an understanding of how to speak about folks in rural areas, not speaking down to them, not saying I'm from the government I'm here to help, he says.
MARTIN: But as evidenced by the news today from Wall Street, financial markets were not reassured. We've got NPR's chief economics correspondent Scott Horsley with us this morning. Hi, Scott.
GREENE: So if Democrats know that this could be purely symbolic, is there still an argument in their mind that it's worth doing this to send some kind of message?
MARTIN: So the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the United States a D-plus rating on the last report card, which came out in 2017. That seems real bad. Why...
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., signaled Tuesday that Democrats had the support they needed to move forward with the vote. But debate on the Senate floor was delayed when Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., indicated Wednesday that he'd require Senate clerks to read the more than 600 page bill on the floor, pushing the vote by several hours.

The resolution, once approved by both chambers, will pave the way for Senate Republicans to pass tax legislation that only requires 50 votes. It is that same process Republicans used to try to pass health care legislation without needing any Democrats.
Young people should not miss out on their education because of something that is a normal part of life for half the population, she said. Removing barriers to healthy, active, educational outcomes for children and young people is an important part of the Government's Youth and Wellbeing Strategy.

ERICKSON: Well, it helps the present businesses. We've had several here say that hooking up to the fiber network has increased their ability to do business greatly. But we also saw this as something for the future, like you allude to. We expect our children to leave our communities when they graduate from high school and go to college and learn about life. But they have to have a reason to return. And the millennials today, and those who follow, will find it difficult to come back to a community that doesn't offer the kind of Internet connection that they want. What we have our fingers crossed for, and it looks pretty good, we believe we've attracted a four-year medical school to our area, which will change the face of our communities in a very positive way for a long, long time, if it happens. And that was a direct result of the fiber network.
The West has seen heat waves and earlier-than-normal wildfires, some of which have displaced millions of Americans. And it has seen record temperatures. Palm Springs, Calif., as of October, had experienced 147 days above 100 degrees, a record. Phoenix saw 145 days above 100 degrees in 2020, also the most ever. And all of the top five years of 100-degree-plus days there are in the 21st century.
As the scope of the film grew, Joanna James went to Women Chefs & Restaurateurs, a networking association for women in the culinary industry, for financial help in 2016.

Over the last couple months, Joe Biden has really framed that as blowing up Obamacare, undoing the Affordable Care Act - and saying, I'm the one who wants to build on Obamacare. Other people want to tear it down. So it was interesting to me that, tonight, Joe Biden made that point on stage saying, she's with Bernie, but I'm with Obama, speaking about Warren's support for Sanders' plan. But then seeing so many of the other candidates make pains to say, thanks, Barack Obama.
He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, and carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also. I love those people.

CENSKY: And in Michigan, our Democratic secretary of state is saying she wants to do things like mail absentee ballot applications to registered voters in federal elections. Republicans are countering with things like putting cameras on unstaffed ballot drop boxes. Neither of those are likely to get very far, but there is middle ground on issues like making sure there's common training for poll challengers.
In fact, I think will make people work better and smarter and harder and also be able to do things like spend time with their families 'cause we're not robots. We're not just designed just to work all day and run a rat race. We're designed to be in community, to volunteer, to vote, to raise our kids. And I think the more inputs and investments we can give in people to do those things, the better off we are as a community.
Despite those challenges, reconciliation is seen by some as a way to advance fiscal legislation along party lines without setting off another filibuster fight.
I'm wary of assigning the term 'defining moment' on anything related to Trump, since he has demonstrated an ability to create entirely new news cycles or controversies as soon as the current one presents him problems, said GOP strategist Kevin Madden, who was a senior adviser to Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign and worked on Capitol Hill for Tom DeLay and John Boehner when they were majority leaders. He [Trump] has an ability to persevere not shared by many conventional politicians. But the repeal-and-replace effort is important, because it's a promise that has been promoted for seven years, and the expectations for delivering on it are high.
The Trump administration has also summoned Wall Street executives to the White House for a meeting on Wednesday about the impacts of the coronavirus on the economy, a person familiar with the meeting confirmed.
And, it's crucial that every American have access to the education and skills they need to get the jobs of the future.
But the compromise legislation has drawn criticism from some Democratic lawmakers and advocates, who have taken issue with key provisions of the bill, including how the specifics of new commercial and criminal justice regulations will be decided next year, when Democrats may no longer control both chambers of the state legislature, The Washington Post notes.
HASSETT: No, I think you should definitely worry about it (laughter). But I think that, you know, again, when President Trump was elected, we were the highest corporate tax place on earth. You know, when was the last time you saw a new factory being built? Manufacturing jobs declined about 200,000 under President Obama. And President Trump has come in, and we've lifted manufacturing jobs already by about 500,000, and the factories are coming back, and they're coming back, you know, because of simple economics 101 - we're an attractive place to be again because the tax rates are back sort of in the middle of the pack for the world.
Transportation. People are sitting in traffic 42 hours average, per year. That's a vacation period. Now, one of the things we're also finding is, when we did a study, $3,400 is what an American family pays right now because of our failure to invest in infrastructure. That's the hidden tax we pay today because of inefficiencies in the system. Sitting in congestion, added cost. We can invest now and save those dollars.
This week, Donald Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner, will speak at the AIPAC conference in an effort to convince the American Jewish lobby that he has a serious pro-Israel foreign policy.
HORSLEY: While state revenues on balance have fared better than many people expected, though, that's only part of the story. State and local governments are also facing unexpected expenses, including tens of billions of dollars in added costs for Medicaid. Michael Leachman of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says some states are also providing direct assistance to struggling families and businesses.
Still, the mandate and its associated tax penalties for people who don't comply have become a lightning rod for people dissatisfied with the ACA. In 2014, the first year that the fine for lack of coverage was in place, about 7.5 million Americans paid an average penalty of $200 for not having insurance according to the IRS. In 2015, the potential penalties rose to the greater of 2 percent of annual income or $325 per adult. And this year they rise again to the greater of 2.5 percent of income or $695 per adult.

INSKEEP: Let me raise an awkward question here, Senator Brown. You've mentioned that one difference between you and President Trump is you don't want to use racist terms. You want to speak to workers regardless of race. This raises an interesting question for you. Jamelle Bouie of Slate is one of a number of analysts who have suggested in print it might be time for Democrats to nominate a woman or a person of color because of the political situation, because Democrats have so many women who succeeded in 2018. Do you think there's something to that argument?
At the start of the meeting, which was open to pool reporters, Trump told the tech executives he was here to help you folks do well, and referred to the bounce in the stock market since Election Day, saying, Right now everybody in this room has to like me a little bit. (Though for the most part, tech companies have lagged behind the big gains.)

I saw a doctor, who gave me a couple pills and sent me on my way. But I still hadn't really done any paperwork. I was like, 'This isn't right!'  McElroy says onstage, to giggles from the crowd. So I went back to the same woman, and I said, 'What do I do now?' And she said, 'You go home!' 
[The diplomatic outpost in Benghazi was not a consulate. Here's how former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell described it in a Politico article: [The State Department facility in Benghazi has been widely mischaracterized as a US consulate.

KING: OK. That sounds quite serious. How are these restrictions going to be enforced? I mean, are you seeing, like, police out in the streets asking people where they're headed?
At a moment of rampant disinformation, and conspiracy theories juiced by algorithms, we can no longer turn a blind eye to a theory of technology that says all engagement is good engagement, said Cook, speaking just weeks after the Jan. 6 siege on the Capitol.
Punjabi farmers are powerful. They dominate India's national farm unions. They may also have the most to lose under Modi's new laws.
It's Democrats from more liberal districts who have been making noise about impeaching Trump, while members in more competitive swing districts — which Democrats will need to win to reach the 23 seats required to take back the House — have generally opposed such an idea. Democratic leaders don't want to make impeachment a central tenet of their pitch to voters and are fearful it could backfire with voters, just as this new poll suggests, but major donor and California billionaire Tom Steyer has launched a major campaign pushing to oust Trump.
It's not enough to pay lip service to being on your side. We have to recognize how Americans actually live and work in the 21st century – and then offer real solutions that make your lives easier.
The bar chart below shows what current tax brackets brackets look like, compared with the House GOP's proposed brackets. We will update it as we get more information. The table also lays out different changes for different types of taxpayers. We will update that table as well, as new information is released.
COHN: Yeah, it was a big distance. And Bernie Sanders had a demand, although I think it says a lot about Bernie Sanders, the nature of the demand. When we talk about demands senators make, you know, some - oh, you know, I want a tax break for an industry in my state or, you know, extra Medicaid money for my state or what have you. Bernie Sanders said, if you want my vote, I want money to go directly to what are called federally qualified health centers. And these are basically clinics all over the country. They - it's part of a program that started in the 1960s that exclusively give health care, either free or discounted, to people who either don't have insurance or can't pay their medical bills.
With the new special enrollment period, how long someone has been uninsured isn't relevant, nor do people have to provide documentation that they've lost job-based coverage.

Pence said he has not been tested for the respiratory disease.
ZARROLI: This shutdown comes at a time when the U.S. economy has been doing pretty well. Unemployment has been low. But Joseph Brusuelas says the longer the shutdown lasts, the more likely it is that the job market will suffer. In fact, more jobs could be lost than created for the first time since 2010. And he notes this comes at a time of ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China as well as an economic slowdown in Europe and Asia.
Khairallah's new clinic has quickly become a lifeline for patients, who crowd into a small waiting room.
South Korea now has 5,328 cases, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of that figure, 32 people have died and 41 have been discharged after recovering from the disease.

SHAPIRO: The RNC chair, Reince Priebus, has said politics is a team sport, and we can't win unless we rally around whoever becomes our nominee. Do you disagree with him?
States could choose to try to make up for federal Medicaid spending cuts and maintain current levels of coverage, but that would probably involve raising state taxes, cutting other budget items such as education, or both.
Those are the clobber passages, Koster says. They're used to clobber queer kids back into being straight.

Harley pounced on news released Friday regarding EU tariffs on Harley motorcycles and the company will be implementing plans to offshore more production. Even before the EU's announcement, Harley made the decision to close its plant in Kansas City and has manufacturing facilities in India and Brazil. It also announced a future plant in Thailand. This latest move is in keeping with Harley's past decisions to open plants outside of North America. Will Harley use any excuse to ship jobs overseas? Does Harley even understand what 'Made in America means?'
I wouldn't recommend keeping it on for 25 years. I think the high unemployment is going to last for at least a couple more years.

News Brief: Trump Impeachment, Democratic Debate, China Trade Deal
So let's just make sure we don't put a person like this with his empty promises and his lifetime of selfishness in a position to destroy our lives.
DONOVAN: I believe so. We also have to deal with this - the federal - the continuing resolution that's keeping the federal government running.
Trump's main goal for health care policy is to repeal the Affordable Care Act. That feat will be harder than Trump seems to think, as we reported. To completely repeal and replace the act, he would need 60 votes in the Senate, which is the number needed to overcome a filibuster. Though they'll make up a majority, there will be only 51 Republican senators come January. He recently signaled in an interview that he may be open to keeping provisions of Obamacare that expand insurance to people with pre-existing conditions and to young people.
BALABAN: It comes out of a giant white plastic container.
Donald Trump's presidential campaign is going into five more states with a new $10 million television ad buy. It's the largest for the Trump campaign so far, which has been relatively slow to invest in TV ads, relying instead on free media coverage and the Republican nominee's large social media following.
But before we can get to why, let's back up and try to find a simple definition.
The White House official said these Democratic plans would cost unsustainable amounts of taxpayer dollars, adding that Ivanka Trump sees her role as an advocate for producing legislation that actually has a viable path forward.
What we did as a bank group is we said, 'Why should we be self-destructive and put the guy into bankruptcy?'  Pomerantz said.  'We'll get less out of him than if we send him out here and make him walk around as if he's still successful and alive, and sell all this stuff for us.' 
Trump does not want to privatize Social Security, nor does he want to raise the retirement age or increase taxes. He told AARP he plans to fund the entitlement program through an economy that is robust and growing, and he specifically highlighted his tax and immigration plans as key players in that growth.
SAGAL: On Monday, the U.N. condemned blank's latest missile tests.
Trump signed two executive orders keeping one of his top campaign promises, ordering the U.S. government to begin construction of a wall along the Southern border with Mexico. He asserted that while the U.S. government would have to front the money, Mexico would pay it back. (Mexican leaders have said they will not.) Trump also directed the Homeland Security and Justice departments to withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities.
The House Judiciary Committee, led by Democrats, will vote tomorrow to recommend that the House hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt. This comes after Barr failed to comply with a congressional subpoena demanding the full, unredacted Mueller report. For its part, the Justice Department has indicated it wants to negotiate to avoid contempt proceedings. So what is behind this back-and-forth? Well, let's ask a Democrat on the committee. Congressman Ted Deutch of Florida joins us.
INSKEEP: Is there a risk when you start lowering tax rates and hoping you will also eliminate deductions that the deductions get defended - they don't actually go away, and you just end up cutting rates and increasing deficits?
This is being pushed by a far-leftist organization from the city of Chicago that wants to be able to get up and chirp about the president of the United States, Righter said. We ought to be better than this.
GROSS: What is an example of a compromise that Nancy Pelosi made in the House, because she had a lot of trouble getting enough votes?
Avenatti told NPR that his tax situation is beside the point.
ALICE SYMMES: Never - this is my first time. And I got my mom to come with me (laughter).
CORLEY: He and other activists point to studies of bail reform in New Jersey, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere, which show little difference in crime rates and only small increases in people failing to show up for court. The Illinois bail reform legislation would not go into effect for a couple of years, until January 2023. That may be enough time for supporters and opponents of the Illinois bail law to iron out the challenges that come with such a monumental change.
This may be the Achilles' heel of Washington state's marijuana tracing system. The amount of product that a plant produces depends on lots of different things, it's not a constant, says Mark Kleiman. He's a professor of public policy at New York University and his consulting company BOTEC studies the pot market for the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board.
DeVos has made missteps when it comes to historically black colleges, as we reported:
But figuring out how to actually pay for something like this - and as you talked to Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, she didn't have a lot of ideas on how this would actually be paid for aside from taxes and deficit spending. And deficit spending - obviously something that Democrats, like you pointed out, have been critical of Republicans on in some of their tax cuts.
So we have exactly what the corporate tax cut is trying to engineer — really high post-tax profit rates. And yet it has not resulted in more investment.
This is not a financial crisis, Trump said. This is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world.
Given that, some Democrats are hesitant to nominate a self-proclaimed socialist who wants to overhaul entire segments of the economy. And they worry that that kind of a message would, at best, fall flat with general-election voters.
KIM: He really represents a growing number of Russians who don't have any memory of politics in the pre-Putin era, and they're feeling very frustrated and boxed in.
Feigin acknowledged that it was possible conduct of that sort might violate the statute but added that there was no instance of it actually being used in that way.
So let's prove that this fall.
MARTIN: We've talked a lot about Johnson & Johnson lately and their recently approved single-shot COVID-19 vaccine. At the same time that the company is working to end the coronavirus pandemic, it is one of the first expected to pay for its role in the opioid epidemic. The settlements these companies will pay will likely total in the billions of dollars. But they're also planning to use corporate tax breaks, including a new one created during the pandemic to offset these opioid payouts.
Separately, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said on Thursday that Democrats' preference is for the relief efforts to be bipartisan.
Once he had satisfied himself that the panel had not been tainted, it was appropriate for him to continue with that jury, MacDougall told NPR. This is not unusual in lengthy trials and — given the facts in this case — not a strong issue on appeal.
My campaign is about reaching out to everyone as Americans, and returning to a government that puts the American people first. Here is what an America First economic plan looks like.
SAGAL: ...Where you ask that terribly unfair gotcha question of - what newspapers do you read?
Whatever is motivating voters, though, the economy for now underpins Trump's reelection message. If the coronavirus (and fears about it) further rattle the U.S. economy, however, it could mean an entirely new backdrop for November's election.
During his confirmation, Price was dogged by questions about investments he made in health care-related companies.
Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Michelle Andrews is on Twitter @mandrews110.
The reason: Republicans have set a goal of passing the first phase of the Affordable Care Act replacement before the April recess, so they don't have to go home for two weeks and hear it from both sides. That means getting it through by the week of April 3. House leaders plan to bring the bill to a full House vote on Thursday. That's despite its facing pushback left, right and center.
MARTIN: And what is his North Star? Like, why do you think he's in public life to begin with? I notice that, you know, profiles of him often talk about he's ambitious. They say the same thing about Mitch McConnell. He's ambitious, he's ambitious. But with Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, people keep saying he just wants power. And I always ask, power to what end? So Chuck Schumer is ambitious, but ambitious to what end?
About 145,000 grad students received a tuition reduction in 2011-12, the American Council on Education says.
Is having two flood disasters putting a strain on relief efforts?
I believe that the people are with us, and that provides the public pressure to get the governor to move, Arizona Education Association President Joe Thomas said Wednesday, according to the Republic newspaper.
State Rep. Gerald Mullery, D-Luzerne, said that could change if the governor follows through with plans to veto a bill that would offer tax breaks to companies that use Pennsylvania natural gas to produce fertilizers and other chemicals.

The president's team would make the case that the U.S. is safer now and that ISIS is on the run. But there have been lone wolf attacks domestically on this president's watch, including a truck attack in New York that killed eight people and another man's failed attempt to blow himself up in the New York subway.
Consider disclosures that FBI agents executed a search warrant last month for business and tax records at the suburban Virginia home of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. That step would have required them to prove to a judge that there's probable cause a crime has been committed.

The state is joining a movement of other Democratic states that aims to force the president to open up his personal finances by releasing his tax returns, something he stubbornly has refused to do and reiterated again this week.
In a world of rational economic actors, he said, lowering withholding would have made everybody happy, since they would be getting the money they would have to wait all year for, in each paycheck. But we don't live in that world, and people like refunds.
One question is who will he be listening to, she says. For that reason, she and other anti-poverty advocates are watching closely to see who Trump picks to head agencies that oversee the safety net, such as the Department of Health and Human Services.
DONOVAN: There may be other people who these modifications help get them from a no vote to a yes vote, but for the people I represent - I'm the only Republican member of New York City. This is a very harmful bill to New York City. It's going to add tax burdens to city residents without receiving any further benefits. What it was going to do to seniors - allowing insurance companies to charge seniors five times as much as they charge a young healthy person. Right now, the law's three times as much, so - at a time when seniors are working, living on a more moderate and limited income at a time in their lives when they probably need the health care more than they need in their early years. I think this is going to be harmful to them.
I say that over and over, and I never get challenged by the fakeness, and they challenge almost everything we say.

A career employee of the Detroit, City of Detroit, testified under penalty of perjury that she witnessed city workers coaching voters to vote straight Democrat while accompanying them to watch who they voted for. When a Republican came in, they wouldn't talk to him.
DETROW: I'll say this. I'll say Julian Castro has shown that he thinks through most of the things he does. He is pretty upfront about the political calculation that he puts into a lot of his actions.
The bottom line is this: I'm running for president to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.
Cancel, woke and political correctness all also happen to be phrases that can be (and have been) used to sincerely debate the best way for a society to be inclusive. But that also is perhaps what made them so easily weaponizable: those original usages imply that there are ideas or words that are not inclusive — that for discourse be inclusive, some speech has to be excluded.

This current lawsuit, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel, argues that since Congress has changed the law to remove the penalty forcing individuals to get insurance, it has inadvertently rendered the rest of the law impermissible, under the 2012 Supreme Court ruling.
Republicans have also been embroiled in an internal fight over two members of their own House conference — one, Liz Cheney, who is in leadership and voted in favor of Trump's impeachment following the Capitol riot on Jan. 6; the other, Rep.

Hill and other MIT students say the tax proposal is ill-conceived. So do economists, who say it would discourage Americans from seeking advanced degrees at a time when the country badly needs a better educated workforce.
A lot of it comes from poor management of resources and poor management of waste, he says. You know, the sun has to shine and the wind has to blow, but we don't have to raise animals on factory farms that create these lagoons of manure that generate this amount of methane.
Democrats push immediate aid; GOP says it will take too long
JEFF SESSIONS: When you evaluate the rules, I feel like I should not be involved investigating a campaign I had role in.
DUTTA-GUPTA: Look. We're talking about 66 million kids getting more money. We're talking about several million kids who now live in poverty being kept out of poverty. And the gist of the new policy is an increase in the child tax credit of up to a thousand dollars per child, and then an extra $600 on top of that for children under the age of 6. But the really big anti-poverty component here is that we would for the first time allow workers with the lowest earnings - those who have lost their job and have struggled in this tough, tough labor market to have even modest earnings - we would allow them to get the maximum credit for their kids, and that would just be life-changing for many of these children and their families.
Trump will also talk about trade, which has been a key part of his populist platform and a theme of past speeches, including recently at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. On Friday, Trump defended his America First approach to trade, saying that while the U.S. supports free trade, it needs to be fair and it needs to be reciprocal.
KHALID: So my colleague Scott Detrow, who's been with the Vermont senator, has been reporting that these last couple of days have felt so different, that Sanders had this campaign that felt so confident in its strategy about bringing out nonvoters, and now it feels like it's scrambling. They had to cancel events to make sure that they could have more time in Michigan.
KELLY: Transparency as a candidate who's asking for our vote to lead the country.
Trump told a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Tuesday that he wants a bill to allow young immigrants who were brought to the country illegally to remain, saying that such a measure should be a bipartisan bill of love and that we can do it. As to what sort of immigration legislation he would approve, Trump said that he was reliant on lawmakers and that even if they produced legislation he wasn't in love with, he would still support it. He also said he would take the heat for both Republicans and Democrats if they get criticism over a compromise immigration measure, adding that his whole life has been heat and that to a certain extent he prefers it that way.
Trump defended the tariffs as a necessary defense, aimed at discouraging China from unfairly obtaining America's technology secrets.

Current and former White House aides say the environment Mulvaney set up as chief of staff was free-flowing and a bit harried at times. One said Mulvaney knows who the boss is and will say things like, 'I've been given clear orders.'
SINGLETARY: Well, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and FHA have encouraged lenders and have put in place provisions that allow them to stretch out when people need to pay their mortgages. But it all depends on who's backing your loans. Many people have nongovernment-backed loans, and they are not subject to these provisions that the government-backed loans are.
We could see very rapid rises in the productivity that ... is a key part to making growth possible, Moore says.
As part of the American Rescue Plan, $4 billion is going toward debt relief for socially disadvantaged farmers to pay off debts that have prevented their farms from growing, the Department of Agriculture said. Another $1.01 billion is being used to create a racial equity commission.

We haven't had many instances in the past that I can ever remember of earmarks that provided at least collateral substantial financial benefits to the lawmakers writing the provisions or being asked to vote for them. There's something really unseemly about this, but it's actually not illegal.
Elections To Replace Some Trump Cabinet Picks Looking Tighter Than Anticipated
Federal unemployment benefits would be extended through Sept. 6 at the current rate of $300 per week, and the first $10,200 of those benefits would be tax-free for households that earn $150,000 or less. That provision followed a lengthy debate Friday among Democratic senators.

So the chances of being able to renegotiate the deal while also preventing further development of the nuclear program are very small. And if I had to guess, I suspect that this is one of the issues that he might have an evolution in his thinking once he gets into the room with people who know the most about the status of the program now and what would happen if they restarted it.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: If an athlete were doing as well as our economy right now, that athlete would be tested for performance enhancing drugs. And Trump would claim those drugs, in this case, are his tax cuts for corporations and is stripping away of government regulations on corporations - regulations that include rules for health and safety and the environment. But even with 3.2% growth in the first quarter and unemployment at historic lows, including here in Pennsylvania, a critical state for 2020, the president continues to struggle in the overall public opinion forum. A nonpartisan polling consistently shows him with far more negatives than positives. They show him 10 points or more behind where President Obama was at this point in his first term. And several major polls showed him slipping below 40 percent approval in recent days. In fact, the best thing you can say on the polling front is that a majority of the country doesn't want to see impeachment proceedings begin now.
HORSLEY: Hutchinson, a Republican and vice chair of the National Governors Association, says his state has already patched its pandemic budget gap and doesn't need as much additional help as Biden's plan is offering.
The unemployment rate is more than twice the national average.
4 Steps That Could Cut Health Insurance Premiums And Boost Enrollment
BROWN: Well, I think Democrats want somebody that will speak to the dignity of work and will speak for workers? And I've - I helped to lead the fight against NAFTA when Donald Trump was still selling - and still is - his products made by low paid, exploited workers overseas, including Chinese workers. So I never talk about trade the way he does. I never pit workers in Mexico or France again against workers in the United States or Bangladesh. I never use racist terms like he does.
There's no evidence that corporate tax cuts unleash a big wave of economic growth or wage increases, she says.
Given the low wholesale prices in Washington, investigators believe the illegal grows are producing for other states where prices are higher, and are here simply to use the local legal pot industry as cover.
In his lunch with television anchors, Trump said he empathizes with the DACA recipients.
Nelson says many flight attendants are already taking pay cuts because they're working fewer flights and now they face the prospect of layoffs or lengthy furloughs.

It won't be easy. Our brand of democracy is hard. But I can promise that a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I'll be right there with you as a citizen – inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness that have helped America travel so far. Voices that help us see ourselves not first and foremost as black or white or Asian or Latino, not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born; not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans first, bound by a common creed. Voices Dr. King believed would have the final word – voices of unarmed truth and unconditional love.

This bill is better designed than the House version, according to Avik Roy, founder of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, because it offers more help to older people who can't afford insurance while making coverage cheaper for young healthy people.
JIMMY GOMEZ: If they get away with it, that means less money going into the Treasury. That means less money for programs that will help deal with the fallout of the opioid crisis.

When a U.S. factory moves overseas, it leaves the Americans who worked there jobless. It doesn't mean trade is bad, but it does mean that it doesn't benefit everyone equally and does indeed hurt some people.
Using the greatest business people in the world, which our country has, I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements.
Focusing the study on suicide may mask other impacts that are less harmful but still serious, Mathur says. Minimum wage hikes could cause an employer to cut someone's job or hold off on hiring new staff. In that case, they may not be committing suicide, but they still could be worse off [economically], she says.
MONTANARO: Yeah, it - look, he said he's not happy with Price. When he was asked if he'd fire him, he said, we'll see - huge red flag if you're in the administration, never a good sign, especially in the Trump orbit. And remember, Trump threatened Price's job during a speech before the Boy Scouts over the summer. He said that if Price didn't get the votes on health care, he'd be fired. They didn't get the votes on health care. And now, you know, it appears that he's sort of threatening his job. He's trying to pass a tax plan too, and he can't have the optics of someone who's appearing to try and take advantage of taxpayers for his own gain. And he's not the only cabinet member with a private plane problem, Rachel.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said it may be possible to work around Congress by using administrative authority to fund unpaid sick leave, but he declined to elaborate on any specifics, saying a deal is still being hammered out.
Nonetheless, Trump began the address with a unifying, uplifting tone, talking about how Americans have responded to tragedies the country has faced over the past year, from natural disasters to mass shootings.

The United States also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations of the world, at 35 percent. It's almost 40 percent when you add in taxes at the state level and in many cases and in many states, it's much higher than that. In other words, we punish companies for making products in America – but let them ship products into the United States tax-free if they move overseas. This, ladies and gentlemen, is backwards, it's backwards. All of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside of the United States.
This would mean a tiny tax bump for many lower- and middle-class households — the average $50,000 to $75,000 — earning household would have a tax bill that is $30 higher than today. The average household earning more than $1 million would get a cut of more than $23,000.

Mnuchin said the roiling markets were driven mostly by the dive in oil prices set off by Saudi Arabia.

The two payments when considered together, however, appear to offer verifiable proof Trump was still very much involved.
And as a result of our initiative, which never resulted in any parent going to jail — never — because that was never the goal, we improved attendance by over 30 percent. ... And it was because we got more services for these kids, and we put a spotlight on the fact that transportation was a big issue for some parents — just getting their child to school. We learned that, you know, if a parent is working two jobs and they've got a 7-year-old and then the 2-year-old gets sick, they might say to the 7-year-old, 'Stay home and take care of the 2-year-old,' because having child care, you know, and paying for that extra day is going to be too difficult. It was things like that. ...
MARTIN: And we should say, money that goes into the hotel ultimately finds its way back to the Trump family who is running all of the Trump enterprises.
Huffman said he's open to a compromise with drilling boosters — from the state of Alaska to Indigenous Iñupiaq leaders in Kaktovik, the only community inside the refuge's boundaries — that would provide them with alternative paths toward economic development.

What we're looking at is making sure that we can get a benefit so that people can make rent and pay groceries, Wyden said on the Senate floor. And by God, we sure as hell shouldn't let folks who are unemployed pay taxes on those unemployment benefits they secured in 2020.
Billionaires by the dozen are contributing to Pete Buttigieg's campaign, Sanders said. Now, I like Pete, he's a smart guy, he's a nice guy. But if we are serious about political change in America, that change is not going to be coming from somebody who gets a lot of money from the CEOs of the pharmaceutical industry.
ROVNER: Well, the most immediate effect is that people will be confused because they're actually repealing the penalties but not until 2019. So for next year, people will still be required to either have health insurance or pay a penalty. And, of course, yesterday was the end of open enrollment for most people in most states.
FURMAN: I - the thing most Americans should care the most about is how the actual economy is going. What is the unemployment rate? What is the rate of wage growth? What is overall income growth like? The stock market, as you said, doesn't matter directly for an awful lot of households. And you could have weird things happen. Something that President Trump actually complained about was correct. You can get good news in the economy. And because of that, people get nervous that interest rates are going to go up, and the stock market goes down. So I think it's much more important to look at what's actually happening for people in the economy than markets because they do crazy things all the time for all sorts of reasons.
A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes.

All these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs; even when the economy is growing. It's made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start on their careers, and tougher for workers to retire when they want to. And although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Do you think that that was a good plan? I mean, do you think the Democrats just sort of washing their hands of the whole thing really is the best move?

Toward the end of Clinton's tenure, Abedin sought and was granted special government employee status, which meant she could work part time for both the State Department and outside groups. She ended up doing work for the Clinton Foundation, as well as Teneo Holdings, a consulting firm run by Band.

MARTIN: First thing, Lenny, I wanted to ask is why are you speaking at these events this weekend? What is your message going to be?
In full view of the White House, protesters in Washington, D.C., demanded answers in the ongoing Russia probe. Chants of Investigate Trump! and Resist, resist! rang across the National Mall.
The latest package, named the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, responds to the growing health and economic crises with provisions for paid sick leave, free testing and expanded unemployment benefits.
The White House does not get involved with who should get a contract. Certainly, they're not supposed to, says Kelman, who served as a federal procurement official during the Clinton administration.
SIMON: Yeah. John Kelly made some - in addition to delivering, I think, very moving remarks about what it's like to be a parent and lose a child, he stepped into the controversy by directing criticism at the congresswoman, didn't he?
But I think the important point is that he has the ability to change the tenor of the trade relationship with a country by talking about it in other ways. And as we all know, you know, he talked about China in very harsh terms during this campaign. My own sense based on talking to his trade advisers and his China specialists was that that was a kind of theater. I don't believe that Donald Trump is prepared actually in any way to go to a trade war with China, I think, meaning that, you know, one of the things that his advisers said to me was that Donald Trump's persona that he - you know, he's confrontational, he says outrageous things, that that would have a chilling effect on the other side and that China would then fall in line. That's their theory. They're not actually prepared for the full economic consequences, which would be severe and profound, of a trade war with the world's second-largest economy.
SIMON: Now back to the history.
Then, five recent chiefs of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty - appointed under Democratic and Republican administrations - jointly warned President-elect Joe Biden that Pack poses a long-term threat to the credibility and professionalism of the five networks he oversees.

Despite the increase in cases, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says, We can push this virus back.
Now, let's talk about how you won Michigan, largely in thanks to white voters which has also been true in other states where you've done well. And I wonder about your effort to close the gap with Secretary (Hillary) Clinton among African-American voters, particularly in light of your remarks on Sunday night, when you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto, which many black leaders criticized.
KENNEDY: We are really trying to avoid that. But what is challenging right now is we don't know. A natural disaster has a beginning, a middle and an end. We're in the beginning of this right now. And we cannot forecast how long we're going to be in this position or when we'll be allowed to open.
In 1920, Black-run farms were about 14% of the total in the U.S. Today, Black farmers are less than 2% of all farmers. Their farms also tend to be smaller in size. As of 2017, Black-operated farms made up 0.5% of the total farmland in the U.S.

Virginia just took a major step towards legalizing marijuana in our commonwealth, Northam spokeswoman Alena Yarmosky said, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.
Since the 2008 financial crisis, the U.K., like many countries, has been taking in less tax revenue — so it's had to cut spending. Its expenditure on the National Health Service has still grown, but at a slower pace than before. That means drugs are now being rationed. Tens of thousands of operations have been postponed this winter. Wait times at the emergency room are up, says Richard Murray, policy director at the King's Fund, a health care think tank.

There are a lot of uninsured people who even before COVID were eligible for either hefty marketplace subsidies or for Medicaid and not aware of it, says Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms.

MATTHEWS: Job growth is slowing. Wages are stagnant. And really, the only thing that he has accomplished, other than dividing our country and going after people, people of color, has been a tax bill that actually has been the biggest shift of wealth from working class families to the rich. So that is one accomplishment, which is why I think the job approval ratings are so low.

MCEVERS: So, Scott, we'll start with you. I mean, usually when congressional leaders are in a tough spot like this, they keep negotiating. I mean, we just heard this from Congressman Kelly. You know, if you're close, keep working on it. But President Trump did not want to do that. He wanted to, say, push a vote and move on. Why?
Expect Republicans to use that answer repeatedly as they continue to highlight questions about Cohen's credibility and motives.
The tax abatement was crucial. It was crucial to the finances of the deal making sense at the time it was struck. It was crucial to the banks who loaned him money to get it done, O'Brien adds. So in tandem all of those things were very important. It couldn't have been done without them.
Then in 2007 - we just learned about this one - Trump is at a gala in Palm Beach where as part of the night's entertainment, there's a speed painter, a guy who paints a painting in five minutes.

The Trump administration says the president would offer regulatory relief to organizations that because of religious objections don't want to cover contraception in their employer health plans.
ROVNER: Well, I think that's exactly what the administration is most worried about. They want this law to have a sense of inevitability, particularly with the opponents still so very vocal and outspoken. And while all these glitches and delays won't really affect how many people will or won't get health insurance, they do create a perception, first, that things aren't going as well as the administration keeps saying. And second, that there may be other shoes yet to drop.
All schools in New Zealand will offer free sanitary products to students starting in June, officials said Thursday. The initiative, which aims to combat period poverty, expands on a pilot program that launched last year.

Case in point: Republicans went nuclear, eliminating the filibuster, so Trump could get through his Supreme Court nominees. That was after Democrats went nuclear when they were in the majority for lower-court judges, because Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell was blocking former President Barack Obama's nominees in to an unprecedented level.
RASCOE: Although the study that kind of came from - there are, like, questions about that because it said that, like, poor people or people on welfare - their kids hear, like, millions less words, and there's a question about whether that's actually the case. But yes, you should talk to your kids. It's important.
HARRIS: Yeah. There's still not enough, but there's certainly an improvement. And what we heard today - we're no longer hearing these sort of sky blue promises of millions of tests and so on. But we're hearing that there have been tens of thousands of tests that have already been run. And yesterday alone, 8,000 tests were run. So that's starting to feel like a response that's really kicking in, including - certain states have drive-through services. So you can drive up and give a nasal swab or a throat swab and so on and have that sent off to a lab.

If you look at Donald Trump's experience, he obviously does not have experience in government. He's never held public office or served in the military. What you find is that he prides himself - he's written about at several places - on his ability to make big decisions very fast. As he put it in his book he says, you know, I remember the day that I discovered that being shallow is a profound insight. And what he meant by that was that you don't want to get bogged down in overthinking things. You want to be able to be decisive.
If being a witness to world events is one of the essential components of journalism, should journalists be prevented from observing an event of significant public interest, even if the event has no direct bearing on their beat or coverage? The evolution of the News Code of Ethics into this Ethics Handbook offered an opportunity to review our decision-making on the Stewart/Colbert event and to add helpful nuance to the guidance on making similar decisions in the future. This handbook's guidance on attending marches, rallies and other political events is different from its predecessor in several ways that won't be enumerated here. But we highlight the shift to underscore two broader themes that should play into all our thinking: First, the guideline – like many in this handbook – is intended not only to answer or preempt questions, but also to raise them. There's no easy one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how participating and observing differ, for example, but there's value in considering where our actions sit along that spectrum.

The president, counter to nearly all expert opinion, continues to treat the smaller number of known cases here (due to inadequate testing) as if it means we actually have a small number of cases and need to focus on keeping cases out, said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard University.

You know, last week, he was just down at the University of Kentucky where he was introduced by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for a speech. And it was McConnell who helped secure a speedy vote to get Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, and he got criticism for that. So - and then Gorsuch is due to speak with the Federalist group, which is a conservative legal group, sometime in November.
In most cases, when an employer pays a signing bonus to attract new workers, that payment is understood to be essentially unrecoverable.

HASSETT: Well, up strongly, I'm not sure. But you're correct that if we exclude the Great Recession, then there was an uptrend for President Obama in the last four years that accelerated dramatically starting in 2017.
That tweet offended many in Britain. It prompted Prime Minister Theresa May's office to issue a statement saying the U.K. premier is proud of her country's system. The U.K. health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, tweeted back at Trump, saying he may disagree with some of the claims of those attending Save the NHS marches, but that not ONE of them wants to live in a system where 28m people have no cover — a dig at the uninsured in America. Hunt wrote that he's proud that Britons all get care no matter the size of their bank balance.
The legislation would also allow taxpayers to write off up to $10,000 in taxes paid to state and local governments, the aides said. The decision was made in part to appease Republicans in high-tax states like California, New Jersey and New York.
BIDEN: Play the radio. Make sure the television's - the - excuse me. Make sure you have the record player on at night, the phone. Make sure the kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school - a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.
But, you know, the administration is still charging a steep 25% import tax on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of Chinese imports. That includes a lot of things, a lot of components that factories in this country use to assemble into finished products. So this has been a tough row for the manufacturing sector. They've been in a slump, really, since last summer. And despite this Phase 1 agreement, there's not a lot of tariff relief on the horizon.
When you hear about the tough phone calls I'm having, don't worry about it, Trump told the breakfast gathering in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. We're taken advantage of by every nation in the world, virtually. It's not going to happen anymore.

Trump's promises to expand health care coverage and spend more on the nation's ailing infrastructure systems — while cutting taxes for businesses and individuals — will be hard to reconcile with competing GOP commitments to balance the budget and reduce the nation's debt burden.

But to this point, for all the bravado, executive actions and tweets, much of Trump's presidency has been showy without a lot of practical effect. For that to change, much could depend on the next three weeks. This critical phase could set his ambitious agenda on course or derail it.
Borrowers will also have the option to suspend payments entirely for at least two months without accruing interest, but they must request these terms — officially called forbearance — by reaching out to their loan servicers either online or on the phone.

She says the big takeaway (besides the need for more awareness and understanding of endometriosis) is that doctors need to acknowledge that women are capable of knowing themselves. This phenomenon can be compounded when the patients are women of color.
One after another, corporate responses have escalated. Some companies have suspended donations to lawmakers who objected to the certification of the presidential election. Many have halted all of their political donations for a few months. A few have gone so far as to support the removal of the president.

That's an uphill battle, but the former Sex And The City actress believes people have repeatedly underestimated candidates like her. When we spoke earlier today, I asked her how.
INSKEEP: OK. So there's a law that can be used to get the tax returns. But no law automatically requires their release, which leads to our next question.
Despite these changes, the political status of Puerto Rico remained in limbo until the mid-20th century. In 1948, Puerto Rico elected its own governor for the first time under U.S. control. Four years later, the U.S. approved the Constitution of Puerto Rico, establishing it as a commonwealth of the United States. This meant Puerto Rico remained a U.S. territory, but created a more highly developed relationship with the federal government.
Last spring, the pandemic stole Maddie Harvey's job on campus in the Dean of Students office. She was finishing up her senior year at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minn., and without the income from her job, she wasn't going to have enough money to pay her upcoming tuition bill.
Manafort's legal team argued that not only could he not get a politically fair jury in more Democratic-leaning Northern Virginia but that people in Southwest Virginia have less access to high-speed Internet and other communications, which means potential jurors there wouldn't be familiar enough with his case to prejudge it.

WESSEL: Well, the stock market had a terrific decade. The Standard and Poor's 500 was up nine of the past 10 years, and this year was particularly strong. And what that does is it tends to widen wealth inequality. Income is people's paycheck. Wealth is what they own - stocks, bonds and houses. And because the top 1% hold half of all the stock market wealth in the country, when the stock market goes up, that widens the gap between the wealthy and other people. The 130,000 households at the very top - that's the top one-tenth of 1%, the 50 million and up crowd - hold 15% of all the wealth in America, and there are a lot of Americans who have no wealth at all.

It's clear that China does have much more to lose, said Peter Navarro, one of the president's top advisers on trade.
A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests. That's because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. Believe me. It's for their benefit.

HORSLEY: The administration is also weighing tax breaks for airlines, cruise ships and other travel companies that have seen a sharp drop in demand. After bouncing up and down like a yoyo, the stock market closed Friday slightly above where it began the week. Major stock indexes are still down more than 12%, though, from their highs last month before widespread worry about the coronavirus took root. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.

After an investigation, it turned out the growers were part of a network with connections to California and Thailand, who had purchased six properties in the Okanogan area. They'd been growing pot illegally on five.
You know, what I think is interesting is that USMCA is something we're going to probably hear about in a general election cycle. President Trump, you know, touts this as a big accomplishment, so it's not an issue that's going to go away.
TRUMP: If I don't go all the way and if I don't win, I will consider it to be a total and complete waste of time, energy and money.
A whopping 42 percent of respondents cited insufficient financial means as the biggest obstacle to starting a business. According to the report, millennials make less money and have higher levels of debt than previous generations. Fifty-three percent of respondents have student loan debt or are expecting to take on student loan debt in the future. And most of them worry about their ability to pay loans back. High levels of debt make it difficult for young people to save for retirement or obtain credit to start a business.
CHANG: Do you think we got an answer to reporters' questions about these veterans donations and the timing of those donations?
Almost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness, the president noted. But then Trump announced, in a dramatic fashion, that he was bestowing the highest civilian honor to Limbaugh.

Everybody has their worries, she says. It's always nice to find that person who will sit down with you and say, 'It's going to be OK. Let's figure something out.' 
ORDOÑEZ: Well, it was definitely something that they came in - President Trump came in as an outsider. He said he wanted to shake up Washington. And I think there really is no question that he accomplished that. But now you have people from his own administration saying - those from his former administration saying that shakeup may have made things worse than they are now.

When somebody promises to do something, you have to think about whether that's something you'd be willing to see happen, said Wittes, the Brookings Institution scholar. Because the powers are simply too vast and too dangerous to say, 'Well, he was probably clowning around at that point or he doesn't know what he's saying.'
The Committee's request raises serious issues concerning the constitutional scope of congressional investigative authority, the legitimacy of the asserted legislative purpose, and the constitutional rights of American citizens, Mnuchin writes.

Americanism, not globalism, will be our new credo. Our country will reach amazing new heights. All we have to do is stop relying on the tired voices of the past. We can't fix a rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place. We can't solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created them. Only by changing to new leadership, and new solutions, will we get new results. We need to stop believing in politicians, and start believing in America.

We all look longingly back at our country, wondering when and if there'll be a good moment to go back, and have a job and a career comparable to the one we can have abroad.

I saw the two halves of an F35 nose cone waiting to be put together. I talked with some of the workers about the absolute perfection that is required to do this work. And what I believe with all my heart is that what's happening here, can happen in so many places if we put our minds to it, if we support advanced manufacturing, if we are the kind of country that once again understands how important it is to build things. We are builders and we need to get back to building.

STAN GREENBERG: You still have the fact that working-class voters and non-metro voters in Virginia did not move to the Democrats beyond where Trump was in 2016. That vote was stable, and obviously Democrats can't get the kind of win they need to have a real majority both nationally and in states unless they build beyond the suburbs and beyond the metro areas and reach those voters.
So a lot of people are pushing for universal health care. And some people see the ACA as a step in that direction, and I think others see it as a bureaucracy that takes us in a way further away from universal health care. And of course, some people don't want universal health care because it's more government interference in health care. But do you think that the U.S. will ever have universal health care?

When the CBO used a different method called fair-value accounting, the government lost money. The Washington Post's Fact Checker in 2013 likewise gave Warren two out of four Pinocchios for claiming the government had made $51 billion in a year. However, the Fact Checker also listed several places that disagreed, like the left-leaning Center for American Progress and Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

MARTIN: To mark this day, we wanted to take a few minutes to reflect on President Trump's first year in office, speaking to people on both sides of the aisle about the president's legacy and lasting imprint so far. Earlier in the week, before the shutdown took effect, I spoke with two members of Congress about the president's first year in office. We start with Republican Don Young of Alaska, the so-called dean of the House. That's a title reserved for the longest-serving representative. It's been 45 years in Congressman Young's case. We went to his office on Capitol Hill, and I asked him for his take on Donald Trump's first year.
In remarks delivered in late January at a technology and privacy conference in Brussels, Cook underscored Apple's emphasis on data privacy.
If Biden, progressives and even many Republicans on Capitol Hill were looking to move on from Trump, it's going to take a little while.

Ellis, the judge in the Virginia case, has directed lawyers for both sides to appear on July 17, to argue about whether the case should be delayed or moved.
KHALID: Sure. You know, so him and Elizabeth Warren, who agree on many progressive issues, they had a difference of opinion here. She has come out in support of the new trade deal, he is not. The former Vice President Joe Biden tried to kind of make him sound radical on this issue. You know, he pointed out that he felt like Bernie Sanders would not necessarily agree to any trade agreement.
Pushing Biden's plan through budget reconciliation allows Democrats to approve it more quickly and without Republican support. But it also means there are limits regarding what can be in the package, because of rules dictating how policies affecting spending, taxes and the debt are considered. Democratic leaders need to keep their caucus unified and will count on Vice President Harris to break a tie, since no GOP lawmakers in the House voted for the bill, and none are expected to back it in the Senate.
There are also limitations for how schools can adjust a student's aid package, based on the cost of attendance and the estimated amount a family can pay. And then there's the fact that institutions only have so much money to offer, especially at a time when many colleges have issued layoffs, seen budget cuts and taken revenue hits from low enrollment.

Earlier this month, Public Citizen and 70 other organizations co-authored a letter to President Trump, urging his administration not to award monopolies to pharmaceutical companies working on COVID-19 vaccines and cures.

McCain's father and grandfather were naval commanders. His father was commander in chief of the Pacific forces during the war in Vietnam. John McCain served as a naval aviator in Vietnam and was a prisoner of war for 5 1/2 years. We spoke just a few weeks after he'd lost the 2000 Republican presidential primary to George W. Bush. He told me that in spite of losing that primary in 2000, the opportunity to run for the Republican nomination was at that point the greatest experience of his life.
WESSEL: Yeah, you could say that. We know that not everybody did better during the 2010s, but we know that there were fewer people living in poverty, for instance. And we know that it was a terrific decade to be in the billionaire class.

As grain growers, they rely on those APMCs – the government-run wholesale markets — more than a tomato farmer like Sanap who can sell produce out of the back of his truck. Grain needs to be husked, crushed and milled. There are more middlemen involved in the process of bringing grain to market. That longer chain of transactions has long been supervised by the government, at APMCs.

That wasn't the only questionable work Cohen did for Trump, though. He also laid out how he worked, in conjunction with David Pecker, the CEO of American Media Inc. (AMI), which publishes the National Enquirer, to catch and kill potentially damaging stories about Trump — by paying sources for exclusive rights to their stories and then never publishing those stories.
INSLEE: Not necessarily because we have something that I think we need to do in any event, which is to remove the giant subsidies from the oil and gas companies. We need to repeal the majority of the Trump tax cuts, which went to the upper, you know, income brackets - rather than working people - and did not produce jobs. So simply having some reform like that is what makes sense.
The Medicaid cuts are even more draconian that the House bill was, though they take effect more gradually than the House bill did, Pearson says.

PODURGIEL: Well, I think the lesson is that maybe we thought that with the tax cut and how good things are going and getting better with the stock market and everything as a whole - that they thought it would be a shoe-in, and a Republican would win. So they need to, you know, get their messaging back out that it's better this way. I mean, we came out of a recession, and, you know, nothing was done to speed it up. And it's happening now. And they just need to stay focused on that message that we can get this country back to where it is and, you know, keep America first. That's important. And that America first will include every single American.
Perhaps more than anything, Miller says, the pandemic laid bare the need for public policy initiatives that support families: We live in a country ... that has left it to individuals to figure out their family caregiving arrangements on their own. ...

Republican Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Tom Cotton of Arkansas are pushing a proposal to increase the minimum wage to $10 per hour, but they include a requirement that businesses use an E-Verify program that reviews workers to make sure they are not undocumented.

Obama: 'Reject Cynicism And Reject Fear' And Elect Hillary Clinton
Amazing, he says, because he didn't have to pay — at least not at the point of service. In Britain, there's a state-funded system called the National Health Service, or NHS, which guarantees care for all. That means everything from ambulance rides and emergency room visits to long hospital stays, complex surgery, radiation and chemotherapy — are all free. They're paid for with payroll taxes. In addition, any medication you get during a hospital visit is free, and the cost of most prescription drugs at a pharmacy are cheap — a few dollars. (Private health care also exists in the U.K., paid out-of-pocket or through private insurance coverage, but only a small minority of residents opt for it.)

OCASIO-CORTEZ: No. (Laughter). I think that a part of where I am right now is that I'm learning. I think that really what I hope we're able to do as a party and as a nation is rediscover the power of public imagination. I think that this is a very special moment. And, frankly, that is something that I think the president did do, in that he was able to take his profile and say, here's this hugely impossible thing that seems ridiculous, but I'm going to seriously push for it. And for him, that's his wall. And obviously, I'm diametrically opposed to it. But I think that the reason he's so attached to this thing, despite the fact that it's not what voters want, despite the fact that it's not what the American people want, is that it's the only vision he has. He has no other picture of America, except an America with a huge wall on the Southern border.

The testimony on Wednesday from Michael Cohen, President Trump's former personal lawyer who is headed to federal prison in early May, was a potentially seminal moment in the myriad investigations into the Trump administration House Democrats are expected to launch now that they control the chamber.

And there's an underlying policy rationale, namely, why should the Treasury, which means the taxpayers, subsidize the electioneering of exempt organizations?
That idea had created worries of a two-tiered insurance system — one in which older and sicker people would opt into the more comprehensive plans, while younger and healthier people would choose the cheaper plans that covered less, potentially causing a death spiral on the exchanges for those older and sicker people.

We reported at the start of the week that the total balance of student loan debt has nearly tripled in the past decade to $1.3 trillion. That growth is happening in several ways. More people are borrowing. They're also borrowing more money. And repayment has slowed down. That's all according to a new analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The analysis also showed that student loans reduce a borrower's likelihood of owning a home.

Annie Lowrey writes about that in the latest issue of The Atlantic. She calls it The Great Affordability Crisis. She joins us now from San Francisco. Thanks so much for being with us.
Only ending the estate tax after six years — as opposed to immediately — may also have been a way to squeeze a few more dollars of revenue into the tax plan.

We'll see shortly what that is or whether it is even true. Still, Trump's posture doesn't appear to be one through which a deal has been made. In fact, he tweeted Friday that any DACA deal must include building a wall with Mexico and ending both chain migration and the visa lottery system.

RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Do you believe that Brown v. Board of Education was correctly decided?
In asking whether social media ruined this election or not, I had to ask myself how my actions on social media have helped or hurt the country's political dialogue — what my contribution to all that noise has been. I'd have to say that even when I've tried to help, I'm not sure I've done enough.
First — and most pressing for those in Houston — Congress has to get through tricky funding measures. It has to pass a government funding bill by Sept. 30 (or risk shutting down the government) and raise the debt ceiling by Oct. 15 (or risk defaulting on America's credit).
And you know, I said, We have no backline anymore. The only backline, the only line of demarcation, the only line that we have is the veto of the president of the United States. So this is now, what we're doing, a far more important election than it was two days ago.
Below is President Obama's final State of the Union address as prepared for delivery.
Last week, policymakers at the Federal Reserve voted to bring interest rates down. Down! That's despite a decade of economic growth, record low unemployment, solid corporate profits and a good stock market. And it's despite the fact the federal government has already been juicing the economy with big spending and tax cuts. In the old days, the Fed would be worried this would all make the price of everything explode (inflation), and it would be voting to increase rates to slow things down. But, no. The governors are putting their foot on the accelerator. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, at a news conference, explained that weak global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted inflation have prompted [us] to adjust [our] assessment of the appropriate path of interest rates.
Illinois Senate To Trump: Show Your Tax Returns Or Be Barred From The 2020 Ballot
The White House should have been in cleanup mode after Saturday's first rocky day in office, but instead on the Sunday shows spokespersons doubled down on false claims about crowd size and more. Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway argued on NBC's Meet the Press that Spicer had simply provided alternative facts when making his arguments — a moniker that looks primed to persist throughout the Trump administration.
SIEGEL: But you just drew a distinction between Iraq and Syria when you were talking...
You also have a president whose own example breaks with a lot of ethical norms. I mean, this is a president who never released his tax returns. He never divested from his own businesses. And he spends a lot of weekends, including this one, traveling to vacation homes on the taxpayer dime.
CARY: No. I think, if anything, the chances of it passing are even higher now because they all realize it's almost October, and they've got nothing to show for this year. So I think you'll see faster action now as a result on Puerto Rico and tax reform.
What Trump has done is split the coalition that has kept the Republican Party in power for many of the past few decades. It's a coalition between big-business Republicans, sort of the establishment wing, and the social conservatives that are in the evangelical wing of the party and sort of white reactionaries. And Trump is taking those in one direction, and McConnell is getting heat from the business community and the other because after the Capitol mob rebellion and insurrection, the business world said, forget it, we're not supporting these people anymore.
Who Would Enjoy Tax Breaks Under The GOP Health Care Proposals?
In his new role, Price, a retired orthopedic surgeon from suburban Atlanta who served as chairman of the House Budget Committee, is expected to implement the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, which his colleagues in Congress have been working on this year.
The Clinton campaign responded later Monday saying that Trump's reckless approach to business has devastated working families and communities.

DETROW: Let's just get to that last big one for so many people with kids in school. What could schools look like in the fall?
They're weak Republicans, they're pathetic Republicans and that's what happens.
President Trump was here to do what he does best, and that is to close the deal, said House Speaker Paul Ryan at a press conference after the meeting. He is all in and we are all in to end this Obamacare nightmare.
DETROW: And that's the closest he came to cursing, we should say.
GREENE: And there's this really high-profile person running for president in 2020 who we definitely haven't seen tax returns from. That's the president of the United States.
CORNISH: All right, so this rule for smokers, this was supposed to deal with smokers who would choose to get coverage through the new health insurance exchanges. And they would have faced some surcharges or penalties for that habit, right?
Nevertheless, Brady and House Speaker Paul Ryan have proposed a 20 percent border adjustment tax that they believe is necessary to level the playing field.
Instead, authorities say she took books that were already purchased and resold them. Pugh then funneled those proceeds into her own political campaigns and used the cash to purchase and renovate a house in Baltimore.
In addition, the poll showed that a plurality of Americans — 50 percent — believe the tax plan would raise their taxes.
I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as president.
These clinical terms are still often treated like dirty words, and that's a problem, Gunter says. When you can't say a word, the implication is that it's shameful and that it shouldn't be talked about. And that stifles your ability to find out what's typical, versus what might be a medical condition.
Later, if they believe they're not getting paid fairly, their options are slim. They can hire an expert to audit their royalties and go to court, but some can't afford to do that.
Mr. KLINE: And he had a bug, and it crashed.
This is someone whose reaction to the horrific mass shooting in Orlando was to publicly congratulate himself. And on Friday, when Britain voted to leave the European Union, he crowed from his golf course about how the disruption could end up creating higher profits for that golf course, even though, within 24 hours, Americans lost $100 billion from our 401(k)'s. He tried to turn a global economics challenge into a infomercial.
House Republicans passed their tax bill, but not without some dissent in the ranks. Rep. John Faso, a Republican from New York, voted no. He tells NPR's Scott Simon about how he reached his decision.

We know a little more this morning about President-elect Trump's economic team. He has selected billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, Jr. for commerce secretary. And Trump has picked his campaign finance chairman Steven Mnuchin as treasury secretary. He's had a career on Wall Street and in Hollywood.
Those earning about $28,000 or less could save an average of $180 a year through the changes to limits on FSA and HSA contributions and the threshold on medical deductions, he says.
Bardack also said she evaluated Clinton nearly two weeks ago, on Sept. 2, for a 24-hour history of a low grade fever, congestion and fatigue. Clinton was also treated in January for a sinus and ear infection.
Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who has criticized the Trump administration's reliance on tariffs against U.S. trading partners, took issue with Monday's tweet.
He doesn't know what he is doing, Grant said. When he says that he's going to waive the obligation for the purpose of voting, but it's not going to affect the amount of money that the returning citizen owes government, or it's not going to affect the amount of money that the government collects from returning citizens, what he is doing is promising to violate state law.
Biden said in remarks on Saturday at the White House that funding for the American Rescue Plan will get the country in a place to get back to normal.

The convention took up a motion to nominate Tim Kaine as the party's vice presidential candidate. Rep. Marcia Fudge moved to approve the nomination by acclamation. Most of the delegates obliged and Kaine was officially nominated. But for about a minute, supporters of Bernie Sanders who oppose Kaine demanded a roll call vote.
The bill would offer tax credits, refundable in advance, to people with incomes below $75,000. But those credits will be lower in many cases than the subsidies now offered in the ACA.
By the time we reach the warehouse it's dark out, but the Wholesum team is still hard at work — packing trucks for delivery. The process is nearly complete as we watch 18-wheelers pull off into the night, ferrying tons of fresh Mexican produce to a supermarket near you.
James and her co-producer, Katy Jordan, are both first-time moms. Now traveling the country sharing the documentary at film festivals and seeking distribution for theatrical release, they have become keenly aware of the struggle to balance work and family. In particular, Jordan was struck by an interview in the film with Michelin-starred chef Barbara Lynch in which Lynch describes coming back to her restaurant just two weeks postpartum.
Whatever the Republicans are going to do, they've got to make it look as different from the ACA as they can for political reasons, said Edward Fensholt, a senior benefits lawyer at Lockton Companies, a large insurance broker. There are some pieces that aren't broken, and the more you ... make something different from the ACA, the more you risk screwing up things that look OK.
While that sounds unlikely for a party dedicated to fiscal responsibility, it wouldn't be unprecedented. In 2003 the huge Medicare prescription drug law was passed by a Republican Congress — with no specified funding to pay for the benefits.
Critics say these casino donations to outside groups spending heavily in Louisiana appear to cirvcumvent a state law aimed at keeping gambling money out of politics.
In the U.S., it's uncommon to see the distribution of mosquito nets and rehydration salts. Even though in Texas we do have mosquitoes, we're very fortunate that the shelters have well-contained vector control [methods to shut out mosquitoes and other disease-carrying animals].
At the same time, Grant cast doubt on the legality of how the process is playing out in Hillsborough County, which he represents. There, State Attorney Andrew Warren has started a process that will waive fines and fees that are owed only in connection with the right to vote — but that money can still be sent to collections.
Mexico's refusal has already created friction between the countries. Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto abruptly canceled a planned meeting with Trump next week, a decision that the U.S. president tried to explain as mutual.
As part of last year's event, Kenya's Ministry of Health announced it would create a national menstrual hygiene management policy. The plan was to have it completed in time for 2016's Menstrual Hygiene Day — coming up quickly on May 28 — although it won't quite be ready, says Beverly Mademba, who's head of programming for WASH United's Nairobi office. It's taken longer than expected to finalize the draft document.
Biden's $1.9 Trillion Rescue Plan Set To Turbocharge U.S. Economy
Economists disagree on whether the tax plan would be good for the economy. The Tax Policy Center says that over the first decade, the government would lose $6.2 trillion in revenue, producing huge budget deficits that could hurt the economy.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And Rena Tolson is from Columbia, Md., and she's here in the studios with us.
M: Well, that's right. I mean, something's got to pay for it. So it's not a free lunch, to extend unemployment benefits. It's going to cost tens of billions of dollars.
In Arlington, Texas, providing support for local vaccination efforts is costing the city $400,000 a week and Mayor Jeff Williams, a Republican, says he is preparing for a likely drop in property taxes.
I am very grateful for that introduction. But more importantly, I want to thank her for fighting every single day for families like hers, families like yours and millions of hard-working Americans who deserve to have more folks on their side.
Jones did not immediately provide a response to NPR's requests for comment.
These infrastructure projects, you're talking about $3, 5, 10 million projects, it's unattainable for communities without assistance, St. Germaine says.
She did respond, though, when asked on ABC's This Week about Buttigieg's fundraising. She, like Sanders, is not accepting big-money contributions.
Biden has also gone after Sanders, saying the Vermont senator's self-avowed democratic socialism would make it hard to expand his base of support.
Gordon says bringing immigrants into the workforce is the best way to deal with this mass retirement of baby boomers.
We have now fundamentally transformed American society, she says. We have gone from assuming many people will not have insurance to expecting that people will have insurance.
MARTIN: That was Alex Bolton, senior reporter at The Hill, telling us about Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Alex Bolton, thank you so much.
Today, I will outline my economic vision. In the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies, and the ones we have already rolled out (protesters interrupt) ...thank you everybody. This is what happens when you go from thirty five people to close to two thousand people, I guess. — in the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website.
BROWN: Real populism is never racist. It's never anti-Semitic. It doesn't divide people. It doesn't give tax cuts to rich people. It doesn't do any of those things, real populism. And that's what this fight's about.
Donald Trump has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past 30 years. That's one every three days, give or take. And today's Wednesday, so he's due for another one.
Hoskins says she's always wanted little redheaded babies — as do her parents, the sooner the better.
HORSLEY: On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates by half a percentage point in a preemptive move designed to cushion the virus's economic blow. But the market was not reassured. Congressional Democrats are now calling for additional measures, including paid sick leave for tens of millions of workers who don't have it. So far, the White House is downplaying the threat posed by coronavirus to both public health and the economy. The president's economic adviser Larry Kudlow told CNBC any government effort to pump up the economy should be narrowly targeted.
LEFRAK: He's found a lot of them so far, and he's still on the hunt for more.
TRUMP: But every other president really lied because they campaigned on it. That was always a big part of the campaign. And then they got into office. They never did it.
It was the final state without any reports of infection by the highly contagious coronavirus, but on Tuesday evening Gov. Jim Justice announced officials have confirmed the state's first case.
As often happens, these landowners and mineral owners sign these leases the company offers without negotiating terms and without getting legal advice, Anderson says.
The Biden administration's climate ambitions will become clearer this spring when it releases new U.S. commitments for cutting emissions under the Paris climate agreement. Biden announced the U.S. would rejoin the accord on his first day in office, after the Trump administration pulled out and ceased engaging in the international effort.
I do think that we have a number of the ingredients of what can make the individual market work, Lee says. And we want to take those lessons to members of Congress and to policy leaders.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Is there something that the Democrats can learn from this race, do you think, in other parts of the country?
MCCAIN: Mmm hmm. That's a - yes.
DAVID RUBENSTEIN: On this side, I'm the chairman of the Smithsonian, and then the Air and Space Museum is being redone. And then the National Archives, I've been involved in helping them with some things, so...
Mr. McALLISTER: I've heard both sides of this argument. I've heard that, well, there's never been any tape that's come up. I've heard that why would he lie? I've heard all kinds of stuff. I generally don't get into it because I look at this: I can still go back to incidents when I've been at Tea Parties and have seen images of President Barack Obama with a bone through his nose. I've seen images where they had Barack Obama standing in front of the White House and on the back of the inscription of the White House it says: da crib. Would you have done that with George W. Bush?
Rather, the idea is that Ocasio-Cortez and Markey will begin work immediately on Green New Deal bills to put the nuts and bolts on the plan described in this resolution.
COHN: Let's start with the philosophy. I think philosophical differences are a big part of it. I mean, ever since we've been debating universal health care, conservatives have - in this country have fought it. And it makes sense given, you know, conservative views in this country. I mean, what don't conservatives - what does universal health care require? Well, it requires government spending. It requires either having the government displace the private insurance industry or regulate it very closely. And, of course, it was going to require finding new money to fund this through taxes. Well, conservatives - they don't like taxes. They don't like regulation. They don't like government spending. They don't like having the public sector do what the private sector could do. So you're going to always run into some resistance in this country up against conservatives.
KING: Oh, OK. NPR's Sylvia Poggioli in Italy.
It's gonna be post-apocalyptic movie time, he says.
Any time a candidate takes on staff, the staff executing that candidate's message utilize their own credibility to carry that message. That's how persuasive organizing really works, Jethwani said. Or even, in the hiring process it's 'this candidate assured me that I have a job through November, and you have a job through November, so that's why I am assuring you that you have a job through November.' 
SIMON: Do you have any concern about small businesses in South Dakota? Let's say someone from Sioux Falls or Rapid City, who might sell their goods through eBay or Etsy or Amazon - might they lose business now?
GROSS: Your mother died after a long illness. She was in a nursing home. And she died during the COVID pandemic, so you were not able to be with her or to visit her. I'm very sorry for your loss. So - but I'm going to ask you a more technical question here. I don't know how much you had to deal with her bills and with the nursing home doctors and nurses. It's so hard when you have somebody who you care about and you can't see them and they're in a hospital or a nursing home. What did you learn about our health care system from the period when you were able to visit her and then in COVID when you couldn't?
TOTENBERG: In a way, it is rather refreshing. You know, she can only hope that the controversy will now subside. Donald Trump, after all, commented - tweeted about her that her mind was shot, and she should resign. I think this is pretty clear evidence her mind isn't shot, and that she's not going to resign.
SIEGEL: First, we hear the occasional warning that the worst kind of recession we could imagine here would be something akin to what's happened in Japan. How bad are things in Japan?
In recent days, the Trump administration has been caught up in an intensifying swirl of questions about potential financial ties involving Russians, Trump and his associates.
GRANHOLM: Oh, totally - you know, listen.
$1.2 billion to support the agency's quick shift to using telehealth and technology to both deliver healthcare services in response to coronavirus, and mitigate the risk of virus transmission. This shift would require up-front investment in Information Technology resources to support increased use of simultaneous telehealth appointments and upgrade associated bandwidth for
And it's easy to see where these additional definitions came from. If the establishment is choosing candidates who are known quantities and who don't rankle any one particular faction too much, as Cohen said, it's easy to see how those would be people who have spent time in power and who are moderate.
Money deposited in HSAs is tax-deductible, grows tax-free and can be used without owing tax to pay for medical expenses. Advocates promote the plans as a way to help consumers play a larger role in controlling their health spending, and say that the tax advantages help people afford care.
Michael Hansen, a political economist at the Brookings Institution, also gets points for prescience. He wrote a blog post on April 13 naming North Carolina as one of the possible states at risk for teacher action. His criteria were: low-ranking salaries, salaries and per-pupil funding that's fallen in real terms since the Great Recession, and teacher pay determined at the state rather than district level, which makes state capitals the obvious target for an action.
GREENE: That's NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell. Kelsey, thanks.
PARKER: But I doubt very much that the people who are saying yes, Ben Sasse, could recognize him in a lineup. I mean, he's just not - he's not there yet.
I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.
Airlines resumed allowing travelers once affected by Trump's travel ban to come to the U.S.
Would a financial transaction tax have stopped the kind of wild swings in GameStop's stock we've seen over the past few weeks? Probably not. With a 0.1% tax, if you bought $400 worth of GameStop stock, the tax would be just 40 cents. But such a tax would add up to a much bigger deal for high-frequency traders, who can make multiple trades in milliseconds. While it may not have the razzle dazzle of Reddit-inspired stock roller coasters, taxation might be a more effective way to curb Wall Street excesses.
Of course, the cancellation of South by Southwest is just one of many cancellations announced this weekend - another reminder of the power of the virus to disrupt both cultural and economic life. NPR's Scott Horsley reports.
[Union membership has undergone a heavy decline over the past 60 years. It hit a high of 34.8 percent of wage and salary workers in 1954, according to a 2004 Congressional Research Service report. As of 2015, 11.1 percent of wage and salary workers were union members. — Danielle Kurtzleben]
The most important political issues of the past year will be on display Tuesday night, not only in what President Trump says in his State of the Union address but in who will be in the audience.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Let's break down some of the names. There are some names, of course, that we recognize - Robert Mercer. He was a backer of Steve Bannon. But he cut the cord after Bannon's unflattering remarks about the president came out in the book Fire And Fury. So who is he looking to now?
We will also require proof of American citizenship in order to vote in American elections. We just had a good victory in court on that one, actually.
This time, the debate even extends to what the procedure is called. Opponents call it a 'partial birth abortion,' while supporters of abortion rights prefer the medical term 'intact dilation and evacuation.' Abortion opponents say the procedure is brutal and inhumane to the fetus, but abortion rights supporters say it can save the life of the mother and allow her to become pregnant again.
GREENE: I mean, you talk about money. There are just priceless collections of art and relics. I mean, was much of that saved in this fire?
MERRIAM: I'm not going to vote.
The balancing act may prove tricky for this ticket, as illustrated when Lesley Stahl, interviewing Trump and Pence on 60 Minutes last Sunday, reminded Trump that his running mate had voted for the Iraq War.
Yes, as long as their coverage is through the federal marketplace. If, for example, someone is enrolled in a gold plan now on HealthCare.gov, but wants to switch to a cheaper bronze plan with a higher deductible, that's allowed. As mentioned above, however, some state-operated marketplaces may not make that option available, so check your state's website. You can find a list of the websites for state exchanges here.
The Manhattan district attorney's office is in possession of Donald Trump's tax returns, following a years-long effort by the former president to shield his finances and business affairs from scrutiny.

They waited to receive a document from the court that would clear them of the only obstacle that stood between them and the voting booth: a declaration from the court that they no longer owed money for their crimes and they could now register to vote.
Here's how The New York Times characterized one email conversation:
This Week In Politics: Another Round Of Primaries
: Ken Rogoff, thanks a lot for talking with us.
Our southern neighbor is the United States' leading supplier of fresh produce, providing 70 percent of the fresh vegetables we import and more than 40 percent of our fresh fruit imports. That trade has boomed since NAFTA — the North American Free Trade Agreement — was signed in 1994.
Mr. KLINE: IBM refused to bid, as did AT&T. They both said can't be done, it's useless. They saw the future of computing as bigger and bigger mainframes.
(SOUNDBITE OF LOCAL NATIVES' BLACK BALLOONS)
There is a process in the case of NAFTA. He couldn't just do it immediately. But when it comes to slapping tariffs, for instance, on other countries, there's two ways to do it. One requires Congress and one doesn't. If he goes after specific categories of goods - so if he says, for instance, that, you know, Chinese exports of one specific type, let's call it, you know, chicken or tires or something like that, then he can use his own presidential power to do that sort of on an emergency basis. But if he's going to try to impose a broad-based tariff against a country, that would actually require the consent of Congress.
The SSA would get $50 million for equipment to allow employees to telework. Most Social Security Administration field offices are closed to the public but many employees must still report to work. This would allow them to service customers from home.
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos' first commencement address since taking office was interrupted by persistent boos when she addressed graduates at a private, Christian, historically black university in Florida. About half the graduates turned their backs on the secretary in protest. At one point the school's president, Edison O. Jackson, warned students he'd mail them their diplomas if the jeering continued. That led to only a brief pause.
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: We're not going to throw out capitalism. We tried that. Other countries tried that. It was called communism, and it just didn't work.
Trump's legal team then returned the matter to the lower courts with a different set of objections, arguing that the subpoena was overly broad and politically motivated. A district court and a three-judge panel on a New York federal appeals court both ruled against Trump, and he had sought to appeal to the Supreme Court a second time.
TENDAYI KAPFIDZE: I don't see that a rate cut makes me want to get on a plane or go to a sports stadium or any other kind of economic activity that increases my risk of infections.
I said, That's not the problem. The problem is Fulton County, home of Stacey Abrams. She did a good job, I congratulate her. But it was done in such a way that we can't let this stuff happen. We won't have a country if it happens.
And here's something you don't always hear enough from Democrats: a big part of our plan will be unleashing the power of the private sector to create more jobs at higher pay.
The airline industry drives our economy in terms of carrying passengers, business travelers and shipping packages, Calio says. It's over five percent of the gross domestic product.
Meanwhile, there's little chance of a Green New Deal getting a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate.
In attendance were the parents of Otto Warmbier, a college student who was detained by North Korea and finally sent home to the U.S. badly injured, where he died soon after. And Trump also pointed to Ji Sung-Ho, who grew up in North Korea, narrowly escaped from the country and lost both his legs. In a dramatic moment, Sung-Ho displayed the crutches he used to escape the country.
MARTIN: So the massacre in Florida last week has been a major theme at this year's CPAC conference. How could you not talk about it, right? The NRA executive Wayne LaPierre addressed the group yesterday about gun laws, along with Vice President Pence reinforcing their commitment to the Second Amendment. The president is also talking about how he thinks the government should respond. What's he been saying?
Any new health law would need substantial revenue to replace the Cadillac tax and the other ACA taxes on health insurers, medical devices and high-income households that paid for care expansion — assuming those measures are repealed. Otherwise, a replacement plan risks stranding the millions who are now getting government-subsidized Obamacare coverage.
It would allow him to pay less than half the current tax rate on income from many of his companies. He'd pay a lower rate than millions of middle class families.
SHAPIRO: That's Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the winner of last night's Michigan primary.
Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical lifesaving research.
OK, let's continue the conversation about Chinese tariffs with our regular Friday political chat. Our guests this week are E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post and the Brookings Institution - hi, E.J...
GINGRICH: Well, no. I obviously don't. But I'll you flatly, I felt like I had been ambushed and that I'd been lied about.
President Trump's repeated campaign threats to pull out of NAFTA and impose a tax on Mexican imports have caused jitters for Wholesum and other businesses on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.

Remember this, Davis said. The president, whoever it is, will come in with a high negative — probably close to 55 percent unfavorable view. That's not the traditional kind of mandate.

The 70-30 vote for his confirmation comes five years after then-President Barack Obama nominated Garland to serve on the Supreme Court — a goal frustrated by Senate Republicans who refused to even consider a hearing for that post.
Legal specialists also point out that the Trump administration's failure to defend the federal health law could have long-lasting implications for the rule of law in the nation.
I don't think [the tax bill] will increase the deficit.

Trump Pivots Toward A Presidential Image In Primary Results Speech
Cook, meanwhile, is mostly in the hardware business. Apple makes most of its cash by selling iPhones, iPads and laptops. While Apple has apps that do a fair share of data mining, Apple claims it does not share that data with third parties. No doubt Apple's upcoming software update helps its image as a privacy protector.
It's an extraordinary proportion indicating her possible ethics challenges if elected president, the article stated.
If they don't qualify for either government health program, they could consider buying a health insurance plan on the state marketplace or through a broker.
DETROW: So what companies are we talking about here aside from Johnson & Johnson?
ROBERTS: Well, Nixon certainly got into hot water over his. And he was charged more than $400,000 in back taxes. The Clintons had to hand over more money to the IRS because underreporting on the Whitewater deal. And clearly, Steve, even though big majorities of voters tell pollsters that Trump should turn over his returns, the president must think there's a political downside to doing it because he hasn't done it.
GROSS: What would you say is one of the biggest compromises that Democrats made with the pharmaceutical industry in order to get the bill passed?
So why has establishment taken off now? Because people hate the establishment right now.
The House, meanwhile, remains on a planned recess this week, which could be extended. Pelosi, who returned to her home state of California on Saturday, urged members to allow as many staff as possible to telecommute in the interim.
TUBBS: Well, I think the idea is like in Alaska. So Alaska has this permanent dividend fund that's been around for a generation where just for being an Alaskan citizen, as being part of that social contract, you're given a check every year. And I think for something like this to work on a city level, it has to be a state or national policy. But again, before we can even call for that, we need to see if it works and we need to try it. And if it doesn't work, there's a conversation about, OK, well, why didn't it work and how can this apply to the next solution we need to implement?
The two rounds of funding for K-12 schools passed by Congress last year add up to nearly $68 billion. The deadline to fully spend funds approved last spring is fall 2022. Funds approved in December don't have to be obligated until fall 2023.

MONTANARO: Well, you know, the - this Green New Deal is obviously something that Democrats want to be able to try to push at least some on the left because it does frame a blueprint of something that's big and bold and broad - to be able to try to break through this sort of gridlock of what to do about climate change. They know that there's something big that has to happen, but nothing has been able to be agreed to.
President-elect Trump tweeted Wednesday morning that he is drafting legal documents...[to] take me completely out of business operations. He said he will hold a press conference in two weeks with his children to explain it. Many ethics experts say he would need to liquidate all of his holdings and sell them to non-family members to avoid conflicts. At this point, his plans are unclear.
I haven't seen any reasonable improvement, he says. So I think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a Day Zero this year.
So this is another case of the old saying that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
Now, it's true that both of us have proposed to cut taxes for middle class families. As usual, he's making big promises. But, his advisors have said that he may not stand by them.Instead, the tax cuts he doubled down on in his speech on Monday offer trillions to the richest Americans and corporations. One of the differences between Donald Trump and me is that I'll stand by my plans.
Warren said the Trump era has given us the most nakedly corrupt leadership this nation has seen in our lifetimes.
Senate Democrats have reached an agreement with the White House to tighten the limits on who can receive the next round of stimulus checks as part of President Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package, according to several Democratic sources.
[Spending on infrastructure is one area where Clinton and Trump agree. She has proposed spending $275 billion over five years on infrastructure. Trump, meanwhile, has said he would double Clinton's spending on infrastructure — that's a big change from the usual Republican economic thinking, as the Wall Street Journal's Michelle Hackman wrote, as it could mean a significantly bigger deficit. — Danielle Kurtzleben]

But money has become a touchy subject for Avenatti lately. This week, he told a judge he's a finalist for a trial lawyer of the year award — citing a jury verdict of $454 million. But in reality, the award in that case probably only will amount to a fraction of that.
Our brains are not really designed to make those decisions so well. And so what we do is, by grabbing the information around you when you're making those decisions, looking at the context in which those decisions are made, we can help coach you in the same way that the Quantified Self folks grab data around them if they're a runner and they want to improve their running performance or what have you, and then use that information to coach that person to be a better runner.

The Upside Down Has An Upside
One of the biggest flashpoints in the debate over President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package is whether it's too generous. It's the third round of relief, and Republicans have questioned why all of it is needed, given that not all of the earlier relief funds have been spent.

But the frustration and worry bubbled up so quickly because many progressives see the minimum wage hike as the first of several Democratic priorities that will almost certainly die in a hyper-partisan Senate that's split 50-50, but still operates under rules requiring 60 votes — so, support from at least 10 Republicans — to break a possible filibuster and pass legislation. (Filibuster rules for administration and judicial nominations have rapidly disappeared over the past decade.)

It wasn't the common man: The last member of the eastern establishment to win the presidency, George Bush, was not re-elected precisely because people thought he had lost touch with the average man, wrote the Baltimore Sun's Ronald Dworkin in 1999.

BOLTON: Well, I think he's working it out. Schumer told The New York Times immediately after the 2016 election that if Trump is going to agree on issues like trade, transportation, infrastructure in a very real way, then we as Democrats have an obligation to pursue it. There was pushback on that. And then Schumer later told - about a month later told CNN, look; the only way we're going to work with Trump is if he moves completely in our direction and abandons his Republican colleagues. So I think he very quickly realized that his base and his party and Democratic activists had zero interest in working in - with Trump and wanted him out of office. And that was the top priority.

In both bills, there's also relief for insurers. The GOP plans would eliminate a tax on all insurers based on their market share. Congress waived the tax this year, hoping the one-time move would help slow premium increases. The CBO analysis of the Senate bill found a permanent cut would save the industry $144.7 billion over the next decade.
It's not yet clear how President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans plan to revamp the federal health law, known as the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare. They have not agreed on a plan, and they do not have enough votes in the Senate to fully repeal the current statute. So they are planning to use a budgeting rule to disassemble part of the law, which will limit what they can change. But they also may seek revisions in important regulations and guidance that have determined how the law is implemented.
Our challenges are great, there's no mistaking that, Lightfoot said. But if we follow these four stars — safety, schooling, stability and integrity — we can once again become a city that families want to move to, not run away from.

There are a few potential roadblocks. Such a move would more than likely trigger lawsuits. It could also have tax implications. Traditionally, canceled student debt has been considered taxable income (with some exceptions), and so any effort to erase hundreds of billions of dollars in student loans would require a sympathetic reading of the tax code. Otherwise, many students with large loans but small, income-based monthly payments could face a sudden and impossible tax bill. Still, Herrine says, a new administration could almost certainly find a legal workaround, and Warren pledged in her announcement that loan cancellation will not result in any additional tax liability for borrowers.

China has outpaced Japan as an economic powerhouse, climbing to $5 trillion and the No. 2 spot on the list of world economies. It is second only to the United States.

COTTON: The alcohol that we're using for this is a redistillation of the waste products, the undesirable parts of any given batch that we make. We redistill those to capture the good ethanol out of that.
This happened before the high-profile trial and has now become part of it.
CORNISH: So we're talking about what seems like minor glitches, right - the smokers thing or some of these other rules. But at some point, does all this sort of combine to create a sense that the rollout of the law is kind of coming off the rails?
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has defended the legislation as a sweeping effort to address all areas of the ailing economy, from personal finances and ailing state and local budgets to small-business needs and funding for vaccines. He dismissed criticism that the economy has improved from the worst periods of last year.
To put those dollar figures in perspective, we can look at the Army's payment and retention policy — specifically, a summary of its Selective Reenlistment Bonus program that was laid out early in 2006:
Cohen also came armed with literal receipts in the form of the image of a March 2017 payment Trump made to him while in the White House from a blind trust Trump claimed was set up to separate his business interests from his duties as president, and the image of a second check from August 2017 bearing Trump's distinctive signature, that together instead showed he was very much still involved in the family-run business.
The speaker understands the challenges of getting things through the Senate, McConnell added. That's been true for 240 years. But we're aware of those challenges and we think we can move forward.
Again and again in his speech, Trump talked about policies aimed at black Americans: his support for historically black colleges, school vouchers and opportunity zone tax breaks for investment in designated low-income neighborhoods. His campaign is making a push to secure more votes from African Americans, to nudge support higher than the 8% he got in 2016 in key swing states where it could make a difference.
A jury convicted Blagojevich in 2010 on one count of lying to FBI agents and was unable to reach a consensus on 23 other charges. But in 2011, another jury convicted him on 17 counts, including 10 counts of wire fraud and one count of soliciting bribes.
FENG: And people were worried that there might be a difference because China's Ministry of Commerce had waited about 12 hours until after the U.S. released its version of this interim trade truce. And if China's version were off substantially, then that would mean there were differences in what the two sides agreed on. But as soon as they dropped the text this morning, 12 hours after the U.S. did, my producer and I went through it, and there were no differences whatsoever. The same exchanges are there, commitments to things like no technology theft or currency manipulation.
Farmers, on the other hand, have long been allowed to sell outside the APMCs. In Maharashtra and several other states, many farmers are circumventing these government wholesale markets – and have been for years. Their experience could offer a path out of the quagmire that debate over Modi's new laws has become.
This is another part of Harris's record as California attorney general that recently came under scrutiny after a video surfaced of her defending her decision to crack down on truancy.
MCCAIN: I think it's an incredibly important issue because it has to do with one's fundamental beliefs. I mean, there's nothing more important than your fundamental belief. And that obviously has to do with my view that life begins at conception. But I also think that there is some areas that perhaps the Democrats don't want to get into as heavily in the past such as partial-birth abortion. I think partial-birth abortion is terrible, and a majority of Americans do. Medical technology is advancing so that earlier and earlier we are proving that there is a life there because children are born earlier and earlier and kept alive.
MCCAIN: Well, it's very tough, and it was very difficult. But I would also point out that one of the major reasons why we lost in South Carolina was not because of that as much as it was that the entire Republican establishment supported President Bush, then Governor Bush, and were behind him. And he had a great deal more money to spend than we did. And they were better organized than we were in many respects.
On another island more than 1,000 miles away, officials in North Haven, Maine, recently barred travel for seasonal and second-home owners. They make up 85% of the town's tax base, according to Jon Demmons, chairperson of the North Haven Select Board.
Education and health care workers, McAlevey says, have an advantage over the factory workers of previous generations when it comes to building a broader political and social movement.
White House aides say they are now looking at a number of additional changes, including tighter work requirements and drug-testing rules for food stamps, Medicaid and housing assistance. Those changes may not save much money the way changes in the big middle-class entitlements like Medicare or Social Security might. But it will help the president highlight an issue that seems to motivate his base in a year when getting Republican voters excited is the No. 1 goal.
Primary Season Is Here And 'Hispandering' Is Back
The growth of income disparity across the world has now become so well-documented that even some rich people see it as a danger to society.
We also can't try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis. That's not leadership; that's a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately weakens us. It's the lesson of Vietnam, of Iraq – and we should have learned it by now.
And we're simply trying to get that information, which is exactly the way that the process should work. This contempt proceeding is the only way at this point, because of the attorney general's failure to cooperate, that we're going to be able to get this on behalf of the American people.
FRAYER: It all centers on a supposedly nonprofit sports foundation run by the princess' husband - so the king's brother-in-law. His name is Inaki Urdangarin. He's accused of using his royal connections to win contracts from public officials on this island and then overcharging for his services. His services were organizing sporting events. He's a former Olympian. He won a bronze medal in handball. And they're all accused of embezzling six and a half million dollars of taxpayers' money through a complex network of shell companies. Princess Cristina was on the board of one of those companies, so that's how she's involved, though she denies knowing about her husband's business affairs. She does face eight years in prison if convicted on two counts of tax fraud. The other defendants are former business associates, former government officials, who face more serious charges of money laundering and embezzlement. Her husband, for example, faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.
EMILY FENG, BYLINE: Hello. Good morning.
MATTHEWS: I think this is so clearly the #trumpshutdown. And it was interesting because when I put #t in today when I was tweeting, Trump shutdown came up automatically with just the T. But this is a guy who tweeted that he was happy that we were going to shut the government down. This is a president who doesn't believe in government. And I think that's why you've seen shutdowns under Republicans in 2013 and all the way back in - when Gingrich did it in 1994.
It creates a claw-back provision. If a tier 3 energy source fails to produce electricity, it would have to refund the money it received from the credit.
In May, the court allowed more than a dozen state attorneys general, all Democrats, to intervene in the case and defend the law.
Providing health care for residents who lack proper immigration status is an underlying issue with many states that are considering a Medicaid buy-in, said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, managing director at Manatt Health, who co-authored the reports evaluating Medicaid buy-in options for New Mexico.
MONTANARO: Not with his base, you know, and that's - we've never seen a president who has focused more on his base to try to win re-election.
BURKE: Exactly. So I should say that some women on set felt like all of this talk was just playful banter and flirty repartee. But numerous crew members felt like it made for a difficult working environment, where women were getting unwelcomed sexual attention, including a camera operator who they said Trump took a fancy to.
Acting Attorney General Sally Yates (a holdover from the Obama administration) announced she would direct Justice Department lawyers not to defend Trump's travel ban. Hours later, the president fired her, naming Dana Boente, the top federal prosecutor in suburban Virginia, as the interim attorney general until nominee Jeff Sessions is confirmed by the Senate.
But you have a subset of workers who are, in some ways, some of our most disadvantaged workers who do not have this basic benefit that helps them to get well when they're sick or even to take care of a sick child - that these things happen to people. And that's why we were so surprised when we were provided with materials about a poll that was taken earlier at the end of last year and that unveiled earlier this year about how popular paid sick leave is not just by ordinary people - and for ordinary people - but even by CEOs, by chief executive officers and other leaders of businesses. That poll of nearly a thousand - of actually a thousand business leaders across the country showed overwhelming supermajority support for paid sick leave to be the law in this country.
CHANG: That was NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik.
DOUCLEFF: Ukraine and Madagascar have, you know, tens of thousands of cases. There are also significant outbreaks in Israel, several countries in the European Union and Indonesia.
I mean for example, that new hotel in D.C. in the Old Post Office building - I mean you already have stories about how diplomats are going there, you know, just to try to curry favor with him. Any decision that he makes as president is going to be seen through the lens of, you know, how it affects his businesses.
In an exodus spurred by the pandemic, some high profile hedge funds, venture capital firms and tech companies are leaving New York and California for low-tax states, Florida and Texas.
Well, obviously he doesn't want to talk, Pallone said. I'm not going to keep chasing him. I'm tired of chasing him around. Obviously he doesn't want us to see the bill.
At the L.A. Auto Show in November, Rivian finally revealed its electric pickup and SUV with a charging range of 400 miles.
We know how folks were treated, historically, in terms of medical science and research. So we know it is an issue that we must acknowledge Harris said. We must continue to also educate folks about what is happening now that is different.
DAVIES: You said that this measure not only repealed some of the protections that the Charlotte law established, but it went farther and had other provisions relating to minimum wages and lawsuits. How common is it for state legislatures to overrule local ordinances these days?
SWONK: I am very worried we're going into a global recession. In the U.S. we'll, at minimum, see what we call a growth recession. What that means is that growth slows down so much that it can't hold the unemployment rate from rising slightly. That's the mild version. We don't want to see it actually contract and have a much more steep rise in unemployment. And the key is to sort of maintain those kind of conditions so we can bounce out of it and pick up more rapidly on the other side.
Lawyers usually take care not to use materials that may have been gathered illegally and, in this case, attorney-client privilege does not seem to apply, legal ethics expert Mark Foster told NPR.

That's why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. As we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war.
Moore insists he has no regrets about his vote, even though he knows some might think that's strange given the precariousness of his current employment due to the very tariffs Trump introduced.
Casinos are also a big business in Louisiana, and elected officials have a lot of say over the industry, such as the lucrative deal for Harrah's in New Orleans.

The state's governor, Doug Ducey, has proposed a 20 percent pay raise for Arizona teachers by 2020, saying, This raise is earned, and it is deserved.
We're going to make our tax system work for you again, Trump said, with several families standing near him whose stories he told in his address. We're going to make our economy work for you again. And we are going to make the American dream, and that's the real dream, that will be the dream that you want for your children and your grandchildren once again. But we need your help to get Congress across that finish line.

Those pledges helped him pull off upsets over Hillary Clinton in Rust Belt states such as Wisconsin and Michigan that were the key to winning enough electoral votes, even as Clinton maintains a roughly two million vote lead in the popular vote.
Someone's going to have to prove to me how that can be accomplished because it looks to me like for the foreseeable future we're gonna be using a substantial amount of fossil fuels, said Rep. Francis Rooney, R-Fla., co-chair of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, speaking to NPR before the Green New Deal's text was released.
The exchange alarmed officials at conservative religious schools, for which the loss of tax-exempt status or federal funding would be devastating. Their anxiety deepened a year later, when the Obama administration notified colleges and universities that it interpreted Title IX as prohibiting discrimination based on a student's gender identity, including discrimination based on a student's transgender status. Christian schools saw that letter as threatening a loss of federal funding if they refused to accommodate students who identify as transgender and want to be housed with other students who share their gender identity.
ALLEN: In Miami, Mayor Francis Suarez has been waging a campaign to lure tech entrepreneurs to the city. This month, investment firm Blackstone signed a lease on a Miami property for its 200-person tech division. Suarez says it's changing the city and its brand. Miami, he says, is no longer just sun, fun and retirement.
Chuck and I are so grateful for the support shown to our campaign by so many volunteers from across the state. Today is a milestone and the beginning of the general election, and I am so grateful that you are entrusting me with the Republican nomination for United States Senate. We ask for your continued support as we work to earn every single vote and win in November, the statement read.
FASO: No, I'm not. It's not in the Senate bill. They maintain that deduction. Frankly, I'm hopeful that that can be maintained. But I met with residents of a continuing care retirement community in my district down in Ulster County just yesterday. And part of the entire financial framework of those communities are the ability to deduct the medical expenses that they have. Remember, you have to have 10 percent adjusted gross income. Your medical expenses must equal at least 10 percent of your adjusted gross income in order to make that deduction. And so that's a significant amount for people. And now that would potentially be taken away as well.
A two-page letter from the 68-year-old's personal physician, Lisa Bardack, chair of Internal Medicine at CareMount Medical in Mount Kisco, N.Y., says she is recovering well with antibiotics and rest and that Clinton continues to remain healthy and fit to serve as President of the United States. The rest of her complete physical exam was normal and she is in excellent mental condition, according to Bardack.
As a general rule, intelligence agencies in this country draw the line at the border. The FBI, with the proper warrant, can collect information on people in the U.S. The CIA and National Security Agency are banned from collecting information on Americans inside the continental U.S. Instead, they are supposed to focus overseas, though there are exceptions to that. For example, the agencies can say that they thought the connection was foreign. The squishiness of the rules has long worried privacy advocates.
That's a really big — potentially impossibly big — undertaking.
KODJAK: You know, conceptually they do. Fifty-six percent of people in a recent poll said they were supportive. But when you get into the nitty gritty - like, you're going to have to change your insurance, and if you like it, you won't get to keep it - people don't like that. People never like to hear that they're going to have to pay more taxes even if it replaces their insurance premiums. And of course the insurance industry is going to fight this like crazy...

The North Carolina state legislature sparked a national controversy recently when it acted to overturn a law passed by the City Council in Charlotte, N.C. that banned discrimination against LGBTQ people. Our guest, Lisa Graves, says this move by the North Carolina Legislature is part of an increasingly common pattern in which towns and cities pass laws ranging from bans on fracking to increasing the minimum wage only to have their state legislature pass a law that overrules the local ordinance.

Insurers typically added the cost to silver-level plans because those are the type of plans that consumers have to buy in order to receive the cost-sharing subsidies.

The spending bill that passed right before the holidays fully funded the first year of the president's plan to end the HIV epidemic by 2030 – about $291 million.

Scientists warn that a catastrophic tipping point is possible in the next few decades. By midcentury, possibly before, the average global temperature is projected to rise by more than 2 degrees Celsius, the point scientists and world leaders agree would trigger cataclysmic consequences. Last year's historic Paris climate agreement falls short of preventing that, so more drastic cuts in carbon emissions are needed.

Lawmakers in both the House and Senate passed the bill in a Saturday legislative session in a party line vote of 48 to 43 in the House and 20 to 19 in the Senate. The legislation would legalize the use of cannabis by people over the age of 21 starting in 2024, when retail markets would be established. The law would also allow possession of up to an ounce by anyone over 21 and establishes a state agency to oversee regulation of the cannabis market.

LEFRAK: But while you might think Rubenstein's donations to American landmarks bring out nothing but praise, that's not exactly the case. Some argue that the government doesn't have enough money for the parks because rich people like Rubenstein take advantage of the tax code. Steve Rosenthal of the Tax Policy Center in Washington says private equity fund managers like Rubenstein argued to preserve something called the carried interest loophole, which taxes their profits at more favorable rates.

It turns out that doctors can learn a lot without seeing you in person. For example, they can hear about your symptoms, and they can tell if you're having trouble breathing, for example. So to the extent this can be put to use, older and more vulnerable people don't have to risk going to the doctor and the hospital. And at the same time, it frees up those resources for people who really need it the most. So this is a very significant advance, particularly for older Americans.

Those mistakes alone don't quite account for the $916 million Donald Trump reported losing on state tax returns in 1995, according to documents obtained by the New York Times. We don't know exactly where that figure comes from, because only a few pages were leaked. A loss that big could have allowed Trump to avoid paying federal income tax for years.

Wright said she did notice a slight increase in pay each month — but only about $30 for herself and her husband each on average. She believes her taxes rose because they lost the ability to deduct business expenses and, as a result, earned slightly too much to qualify for the earned income tax credit.

It goes back to at least 2002, when pioneering political blogger Mickey Kaus, writing at his Slate blog Kausfiles, noted a recent Hispandering proposal from then-House Democratic Minority Leader Dick Gephardt to legalize some immigrants who are in the U.S. without documents. That's the first searchable online reference to the term Hispandering, according to research done by the NPR librarians.
Any information that can be gained by torture is, one, not reliable. Two, torture is not effective. And three, if I could sum up - there's a great hero of mine. His name is General Jack Vessey. A lot of Americans may not remember him. He was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, got a battlefield commission. He was a private at the landing at Salerno in Italy and fought in many wars. He served in the Army for 46 years. And I saw him recently out in Minnesota at a dinner that benefited Iraqi veterans and their families. And he - I said, General, what do you think about this issue? And he said, any information that could be gained as a result of cruel, inhumane or - treatment or torture could never counterbalance the damage that is done to the United States of America when we do these things. And I think he put it as well as any anybody I've ever heard.

GOP leaders aim to vote on the final bill early next week, to meet Trump's deadline of passing a tax bill by Christmas, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., urged Republicans to hold off on a tax vote until January. That's when Sen.-elect Doug Jones, D-Ala., will take office, reducing the GOP majority to 51-49. Bringing up the final tax bill this month means GOP Sen. Luther Strange of Alabama will be able to cast a vote for it.
Shortly before news of Cohn's departure broke, Trump had been defending the factional atmosphere within the White House.

Such incentives can effectively coerce people into participating and sharing private medical information, critics charge, and unfairly penalize sick people.
CORLEY: Slaughter says the next step is figuring out which risk assessment tools judges will use to determine whether a person is a threat to public safety or not likely to show up in court and should not be released. There have been other efforts to get rid of cash bail. Washington, D.C., was an early pioneer. It eliminated bail in most instances in the 1990s. Cash bail is rarely used in New Jersey.
I am your voice. So to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I am With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.
As the Republican Party moves further away from the Kochs' ideals, it appears that their network has begun investing in bipartisan efforts that unite members of both parties.
Kaine, who is still speaking, just accepted the party's nomination for vice president.
In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Monday, Harley-Davidson said the tariffs imposed by the EU would have an immediate and lasting detrimental impact to its business in the region.
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals threw out that conviction, finding it to be a violation of the First Amendment's free speech guarantee. Both liberal and conservative advocacy groups have urged the Supreme Court to follow suit, contending that the statute is so broad that it encompasses lots of perfectly legal expression.
Prior to the ACA, employers could delay covering workers' chronic and other health conditions for up to a year after they became eligible for a plan. Under the ACA, that's no longer allowed. As a practical matter, though, coverage of pre-existing conditions was rarely an issue in large-group plans, say some health insurance analysts.
COHN: You know, I thought so many times the Republicans were done with fighting Obamacare and then proven wrong. I hate to say anything definitively. But it is very clear in the last two elections - the 2018 midterms to 2020 presidential election - Republicans did not emphasize Obamacare repeal and, in fact, did their best to convince people that they were not trying to take away protections for preexisting conditions, that they were not trying to take away Medicaid coverage I think because they learned after trying to repeal it and then the 2018 midterms that that is extremely unpopular, that the public does not want to give up what they got with the Affordable Care Act. And so I think Republicans are now much more reluctant to make a sort of frontal assault on it, which doesn't mean they don't think about health care.
Robert Hilliard, who represents the Hernandez family, was more than disappointed by the ruling, telling NPR that the path to justice apparently does not travel as far as a bullet.
Pack has thrust his agency on a path of tumult, pursuing an agenda that appears to prize loyalty to President Trump and his policies over the values that, by law, the federal broadcasters are supposed to espouse.
WBEZ's Dave McKinney contributed to this report.
STEIN: No, no. Well, you know, I checked in with more than 20 epidemiologists, infectious disease experts and public health officials that I've been talking with throughout the pandemic, and it's been striking. Most are saying that, not everyone but most. Here's Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown School of Public Health.
You can't have two classes of voters — people who can afford their right to vote and people who can't, Warren said. At this point it's really just a determination that once someone has an inability to pay off their fines and fees, then they're eligible to have their right to vote restored.
The president also addressed the issue of a border wall with Mexico, saying the U.S. needs one in certain areas obviously that aren't protected by nature and where existing fences are in bad shape and need to be fixed or rebuilt.
At the same time the caseworker was helping her, Singh received a final reminder letter from Northwell about her bill. That letter also mentioned Northwell's financial assistance, but only within the context of people who completely lack health insurance.
ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: The other day, Claire Blue stepped outside and heard something that startled her.
And how come Joe is allowed to give a billion dollars of money to get rid of the prosecutor in Ukraine? How does that happen? I'd ask you that question. How does that happen? Can you imagine if I said that? If I said that it would be a whole different ballgame.
Did you ever feel taken advantage of by the royals, for your access to power? one of the prosecutors asked Ballester during proceedings.
[Pediatric disease experts polled by the New York Times] said that children spread it less than adults do, that they're not as efficient spreaders, probably because they don't get sick. So they're not sneezing and coughing all over. So they do spread it less. And they said vaccinations will be very important for life to return to normal. But they said that schools around the world that have been open have shown that when the kids are wearing masks, when the teachers and staff are wearing masks, when they're maintaining distance by avoiding large gatherings and having their desks spaced apart and when they have adequate ventilation — and there are other safety measures, too, but those were really the most important — they thought that transmission is really not happening at high rates within schools. Transmission is happening outside of schools. And if restaurants and bars and gyms are open and if teachers and parents are socializing on the weekends, it's more likely to come inside the school. But the school is not the site of most of the transmission, is what they said the research has shown so far, based on what we know now.
Small things are changing: A street through the island's capital city used to be called the Avenue of the Duke & Duchess of Palma, honoring Cristina and her husband. Now it's just called La Rambla — the Avenue. In the wake of the corruption trial, Cristina's brother, King Felipe VI, stripped them of their royal titles and Palma officials took down the street sign and changed the name.
NANCY PELOSI: Trump is goading us to impeach him.
Trump Promises AIPAC Speech Will Outline Middle East Plan
The report looks at so-called childhood enders or events that rob children of their childhood and prevent them from reaching their full potential, including things like displacement due to war, gender bias, child labor and child mortality.
FASO: Well, you're closer to a pundit than I am. But I would say this - we as Republicans should stand up for federalism. We should stand for lower taxes, improving our economy, getting faster economic growth. That's the overriding goal of this tax reform plan. Unfortunately, it didn't meet all the tests that I need in order to vote for it because, frankly, I'm not going to have my constituents in New York become collateral damage just because New York state has high taxes in this federal tax reform process.
The longest economic expansion in U.S. history, which began in 2009, has finally brought up wages. Yet none of this changes the numbers noticed by David Wessel, director of The Hutchins Center at The Brookings Institution. David, welcome back.

What this piece of legislation does is ensures that we have built the transforming architecture for something enduring for lifting families out of poverty in the United States, DeLauro said. We did it for seniors. We are now going to do it for children.
LAFFER: I don't know. I mean - but I do know I was called by a group of Democrats who are about 50-some members of the House - all Democrats - would love to do something with Trump on the tax codes and reforming them and making them pro-growth as long as they can put in some things like the carbon tax substitution. We need to get together where we have a growth agenda. And I think Trump is very willing to work on a bipartisan basis to get a good growth agenda. And I - and I laud him for all those efforts.
That could be, especially considering how close the Senate may be to forever changing as we know it.
At the end of the day it's the casino money going to the DGA, Ryan says. That arguably frees up DGA dollars to spend in Louisiana — money that would be illegal if the actual dollars came from the casinos themselves.
Donald Trump has promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and now he has released some more details of how he would do that on his website.
Meadows also paid tribute to Mulvaney, calling him smart, principled, and as tough a fighter you'll find in Washington, D.C. and said Mulvaney did a great job leading the President's team through a tremendous period of accomplishment.
The Senate also seems to be less-than-enthused to change any of the big entitlements. McConnell, who will be clinging to an even narrower 51-49 majority in 2018, told Axios that he would not expect to see the Senate work on making changes to those programs without Democrats.
But overall, the state is considered an ACA success story, thanks in part to innovative approaches, including state discretion to choose which insurers could operate in its market and then to negotiate premiums and benefits with those insurers.
KELLY: So what to try next? If lower interest rates isn't the answer, what else can the government do?
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: After consulting with our top government health professionals, I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and well-being of all Americans.
MONTAGNE: That's Garance Burke, national investigative reporter for The Associated Press.
[Politifact has rated this claim pants on fire, but Trump continues to say it at events, including in this highly scripted speech. Clinton has campaigned extensively on not raising taxes on the middle class.

The Republican Rift Goes Far Deeper Than Just Trump And McConnell
In fact, refugees undergo an extensive screening process before entering the United States. As NPR has previously reported, it can take up to two years.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, we're working on a tax reform bill that will reduce our trade deficits, increase American exports and will generate revenue from Mexico that will pay for the wall if we decide to go that route.
When asked whether it was fair to compare his spat with Buttigieg with Hillary Clinton's similar criticism of Barack Obama in 2008, Biden said, Oh come on, man, this guy's not Barack Obama.
Update at 8:32 p.m. ET. A Moment Of Contrast:
U.S. corporations pay an effective tax rate of 35 percent, although most manage to lower that through various loopholes, exemptions and tax credits. The GOP plan would reduce the effective rate to 20 percent, bringing it more in line with other advanced economies.
U.S. Economy Slows: Trump's 3% Growth Pledge Now In Rearview Mirror
The Trump administration wants $3 billion from Congress to fill the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That would help oil drillers hit hard by a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. That's leading to a glut of oil on the market just as the coronavirus is reducing demand because people have stopped traveling.
In many cases, the problem isn't so much revenue as it is expenses brought on by the pandemic. And local governments are bearing the brunt of that, spending more to help residents who are struggling with the economic downturn with food and vaccines.
After years of waiting, it's finally here.

Katarsky's gigs have ranged from one-off magazine articles to longer-term projects relaunching websites. She says being the master of her schedule has allowed her to enjoy her work more. Since I was a little kid, I thought playing with words was fun. ... Now it doesn't really feel like work to me, she says. I've been very happy. Her income fluctuates, but she says she makes roughly the same amount as in her old corporate job — while working half the hours. She juggles multiple projects at once, focusing on those that allow her to spend time with her son. A downside of being self-employed is paying the full price for health insurance, she says, but it's bearable. I like having the flexibility... I'm not beholden to someone's schedule, which has become more important to me as I've gotten older.
I do think it's still an open question. It's still a little iffy about whether [long-haulers] will be able to qualify, says Linda Landry, an attorney at the Disability Law Center in Massachusetts.
SIMON: Does there need to be massive federal government investment in infrastructure at a time when the unemployment rate is so low?
Trade has become a target this presidential campaign season.
We begin this hour with rumblings that a health care bill may be back on the table. You'll recall that didn't go so well back in March. Last month, Republicans tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act. That would be President Obama's signature health care law. But conservative Freedom Caucus Republicans could not reach a compromise with their more moderate colleagues, so might this new push fare better? Republican Congressman Dan Donovan is on the line. He represents Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn. And he opposed the March bill, saying it wouldn't negatively affect his constituents. Congressman, good morning.
Trump's address followed a Wednesday announcement by the World Health Organization, which classified the outbreak a pandemic. In Washington, lawmakers scrambled to find ways to contain the economic fallout of the fast-spreading virus.
In addition, he said, Canadian politics plays a role in determining how many people move into the country. Tighter immigration rules in the past few years, under former Prime Minister Stephen Harper's conservative government, may have cut down on the number of people moving to Canada after around 2012, Aujla says.
The Russian leader wants Browder in Russian custody; Russia has used its influence with Interpol in the past to have Browder arrested. Browder was born in the U.S. but renounced his U.S. citizenship years ago; he resides in the U.K., making it difficult for the U.S. to assert jurisdiction over him as Putin apparently wants.
Many people support a national strategy for paid parental and family leave, especially for workers who are not in management and are less likely to get that benefit on the job. But consultants, scholars and consumer advocates alike say the new tax credit probably won't encourage many companies to take the plunge.
Tenants kept wrecking it. I kept going in and fixing it. Finally, the mortgage and taxes were more money than I can rent it for.
So you, first of all, have to find out who owns your loans. And if it's a pool of investors, there's less safety there for you. And what I'm hearing from readers who've contacted me is that many of the lenders are saying, we'll give you a break for 90 days. But at the end of that 90 days, you've got to pay all that money back plus that current mortgage. So the best thing I can tell you to do, if you can get through to your lender - 'cause that's the other problem - many people are calling an on hold for hours and hours and can't get through. Just keep trying to get as much relief as you can from your lenders.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: I was about to say, what are you concerned about? What should we be concerned about in how our governments respond to this crisis?
Both the technology itself, and the way we choose to use the technology, makes it so that what ought to be a conversation is just a set of Post-it notes that are scattered, Kerric Harvey, author of the Encyclopedia of Social Media and Politics, said of Twitter. Not even on the refrigerator door, but on the ground.
OSNOS: Absolutely. I mean, there's a reason why this law took so long to craft and involved so many subtleties is because you had to balance the political objectives, the policy goals with the practical economic realities. And the simple fact is that if you change one of the elements of this very delicate process, well, then it becomes very hard to imagine how you're going to be able to pay for it at all. So this - you know, we're beginning to see the point at which some of these sort of abstract declarations that he would replace it with something terrific will become much more practical and tested over the course of the next few weeks and months.
In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana. And a great guy.

One constant across the decades: The money the U.S. government provides to families has never been enough to truly drive down child poverty the way Social Security payments, with their regular cost-of-living increases, worked to reduce poverty among senior citizens. Today, children in the U.S. are more likely to be living in poverty than adults, or, for that matter, children in other wealthy countries that provide child payments — countries like Germany, South Korea and Canada.
This is an incomplete story, Kleinhenz said. We will be in a better position to judge the reliability of the results when the government revises its 2018 data in the coming months.
INSKEEP: Yeah. And the president still has not been able to say the name of his successor who defeated him in a free and fair election according to Republican and Democratic election officials in all 50 states, as well as the findings of numerous courts. He was unable again today to say Joe Biden's name, but was somewhat closer to gracious than he has been. Let's listen to a little bit of that from the departing president.
3. How will the federal government offset the loss of tax revenue, and what will that mean for insurance or other programs?
In a letter to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin writes that he needs more time to consult with the Department of Justice given the unprecedented nature of this request.
That veteran, former Army Capt. Christopher Van Meter, fought in Iraq. He tells the newspaper he refinanced his mortgage to repay $25,000 in re-enlistment bonuses and $21,000 in student loan repayments.
In the 1980s, the two were co-owners of the famed New York retailer Alexander's, which later went bankrupt. Today, Vornado, which did not return a request for comment for this story, is part owner with Trump in two major office buildings, in San Francisco and New York.
Miriam Galston is a law professor at George Washington University. She studies policy on tax-exempt organizations, and she says there's always been some opposition to the amendment.
Next comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. While Hillary Clinton plans a massive, and I mean massive, tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has run for the president this year – Democrat or Republican.
September To Forget? Trump's Legacy Flounders, As He Seeks Signature Accomplishment
EISBRENNER: And as a side note...
Think of it. You go in and you vote and then they tell people who you supposed to be voting for. They make up whatever they want. Nobody's ever even heard.
MARTIN: Right. So the travel industry is obviously going to take a hit because of an announcement that President Trump made last night - new limits on people traveling to the United States from some parts of Europe. The president, in his Oval Office address, seemed to blame European policy, in part at least, for the coronavirus cases here. Let's listen.
MARTIN: All right. The race goes on. It's only February, as I've said a couple different times. NPR's Asma Khalid in Nevada and Mara Liasson. Thanks, you guys. We appreciate it.
Even so, the stock market did end the day in positive territory. It bounced around a good bit, but the Dow closed up nearly 200 points, or about 1%. And the government has been taking some steps to try to put some Band-Aids over this gaping economic wound.
MCCAIN: And it's tough. And it's difficult. But I think that what you really need to look at is the - you know, the campaign that you waged. Overall, with some mistakes and some excesses, I'm very proud of the campaign that we ran. And I'm proud when I look back on it, the people that supported us and the people that rallied to us and the - you know, I'm very proud of the job that we did. And for me to be angry five years later and say this person did this or that person, you know, they did this - look; Americans want us to move on.
Very significant is that one of the constitutional changes he wants to make is strengthening a practically unknown body known as the State Council. There's a lot of speculation that Putin will stay in power now as the head of that State Council, letting him really continue to run Russia from behind the scenes without having to deal with the daily grind of governance.
When people say Bob Taylor, father of the Internet.
The prime minister did not appear to offer any specific restrictions about who is eligible to receive free treatments. It's worth noting that IVF can be extremely costly. In the U.S., for example, the average patient undergoes two cycles of the treatment, which can cost a total of $40,000-$60,000, according to fertility doctor assessment site FertilityIQ. The costs are lower in many other countries.
Likewise, Republicans — the party that has spoken of makers and takers — were split roughly evenly on the idea that tax cuts for the wealthy lead to economic growth. (Democrats and independents tended to disagree — that is, to say that tax cuts for the wealthy do not lead to that growth.) Incidentally, it's not at all clear that this is true; one recent comparison of tax rates and growth rates across advanced economies found no strong linkage between the two.
BEYER: I totally agree. It's one of the reasons I have waited so long because I really do not want to do anything that's more divisive than we already are. And one of the tragedies of the Trump presidency is, as I can recall, he's the first president in my lifetime, maybe the history, who's taken divisiveness as his driving political strategy. But the comeback to the notion that, why would we make the country ever more divided? - is if we don't impeach this president, when would we ever impeach a president? We should just take impeachment out of the books. And we do have - while we have a responsibility to heal the country and bring it together, which all of us take seriously, we also have a responsibility to defend the Constitution. And this president - well, just over the weekend, the notion of selling arms sales - huge arms sales to Saudi Arabia against the will of the Democrats and the Republicans in both Houses passed.
Mainstream Charities Are Unwittingly Funding Anti-Muslim Hate Groups, Report Says
People who qualified for federal premium subsidies — those with incomes up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level (about $48,000 for one person or $100,000 for a family of four) — were shielded from the surcharge because their subsidies increased to cover the cost.
Yakelin, who turns 12 on Tuesday, was separated from her mother for nearly two months before they were reunited.
The case made its way to the Supreme Court once already, where Trump's attorneys argued that as a sitting president, he was immune from criminal investigation. The high court rejected those claims, but it sent the case back to the lower courts for more litigation.
Leon Panetta, the former CIA chief and secretary of defense, was interrupted by chants of No more war!
He tutors and teaches GED classes, mentors prisoners regarding personal and professional development, and speaks to them about their civic duties, the statement said.
Guideline: Our standards of impartiality also apply to social media.
Her use of the phrase would not enforce a law is prime for Republican criticism. Yet immigrant rights advocates have argued the administration's policies violate international human rights law, including a program that forces asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico for their assigned court dates in the U.S.
Mike Pence is a polarizing figure in Indiana now, she says.
KING: OK. Well, that's some good news. These reports that authorities are considering shutting down all the schools and universities, that sounds quite serious. How real is it? And are they considering other measures as well in terms of quarantines, things like that?

And I think that that will help set an example for other states that they can enact increased minimum wages and it doesn't devastate the economy. It helps those economies be stronger. But I suppose in that sense that you certainly can't make a patchwork argument against California or New York. But I would say that, again, that sort of argument that you have to have uniform rules across every state no matter what city you're in is just belied by experience. One of the reasons why different people live in different cities is in part because of the different cultures of those cities or the different maybe protections of those cities. Maybe they've got better zoning rules. Maybe they have a more thoughtful urban planning process.
And many did, leading the Social Security Administration to trumpet in one 1952 promotional film that most American families are now able to ensure for themselves an income that is guaranteed for life.
Those views differ widely by party; Democrats are much more likely to believe that taxes should be raised on the rich than Republicans.
If you can't figure out what the establishment is, the political philosopher Jack Black has a good definition.
That means the Trump administration will be open to listening to seasoned veterans like [House Speaker] Paul Ryan, he says.

The phrase was also used around President Barack Obama's 2009 stimulus, which had around $90 billion worth of environmental initiatives.
Over the last 12 months, the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers — HIV, malaria and tuberculosis. But other illnesses, some of them easily preventable, stole the limelight.
Mr. McALLISTER: Well, my take is there are some people that have taken it too far and they have used this movement, a good movement at its core, to justify some of their underlying hatred. There are some people out there. I've seen the signs and I've said this on other interviews and I've said this in other articles where when I see the signs, I confronted, I've confronted it from the podium. I confronted people face to face.
Paul says right now there may not be enough domestic steel slabs available for purchase, but that will change because of the tariffs.
SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: Now, I agree it's a terrible law. I understand why people harmed by it would want it changed. In fact, I think we ought to repeal it altogether and opt instead for real reforms that would actually lower costs. But the fact is, for now at least, it is the law. And it's the president's constitutional duty to enforce the law.
MARTIN: Right. And she did so on a couple of different issues - in particular, allegations of sexual harassment. Others also went after Bloomberg for his tax returns. Mara, how'd he do on those attacks?
CORNISH: Right now, he says he doesn't know anything about it. Is this...

I would certainly resist saying that looking at his taxes would be the be-all and end-all, the full picture of his financial situation, he says. There certainly are ways of hiding money that might not be picked up in tax returns, and there are lots of kind of ties that might not show up there. But there's a lot that would show up, and so it would tell us a lot more than we know now.
Despite their inability to vote on federal issues, Puerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens for more than 100 years and the government has the same responsibilities toward them as it does to other U.S. citizens.
HORSLEY: Well, what's not in it is a answer for some of the big, structural complaints that the White House has long been raised about China. But there is some additional protections, some safeguards for intellectual property for American companies' technological knowhow. You know, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin talked about this deal on Fox News. And he acknowledged the administration didn't get everything they wanted, but he still characterized this as a victory for President Trump.
I've had a number of political people reach out — leaders and grassroots people reaching out, said Evan McMullin, a former policy director for the House Republican Conference who ran for president in 2016 as an independent. He cohosted a call of more than 120 disaffected Republicans interested in the third-party idea earlier this month. They've had enough and are ready to move on, ready for change.
Congress is always free to amend its statutes, even to omit what it previously thought was essential, writes Nick Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan, in a Thursday evening blog post. That's what Congress did when it zeroed out the mandate. So we don't have to speculate what Congress would've done if it had a choice between invalidating the ACA's insurance reforms or just invalidating the mandate. Congress made that choice.
I mean, at some point, are we going to come to our senses and realize this is a terrible way to run a railroad, you know, much less the federal government? But I think Mara's analysis is right. A lot of the politics is aimed at these swing states. And both parties are taking a huge risk by going to the mat. But both parties are also, in some sense, held hostage by their bases. And it's hard to see an easy or quick or graceful way out of this at the moment.
That's the America I know. That's the country we love. Clear-eyed. Big-hearted. Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word. That's what makes me so hopeful about our future. Because of you. I believe in you. That's why I stand here confident that the State of our Union is strong.
That has consisted of more than two dozen executive actions (including a travel ban of first seven, then six majority-Muslim countries and moving toward building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border) as well as picking Gorsuch to replace conservative icon Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court.
But then, there have been upstarts for as long as there has been government. And, every so often, an outsider wins and has to figure out how to operate in the ultimate insider position.
Take Jen Wittlin, who manages Providence's Dean Bar and has worked on and off with James Mark since 2012. She says having good health insurance is non-negotiable, for her. She was diagnosed and treated for medullary thyroid cancer, and still needs daily medication and regular endocrinology checkups.
ALISON KODJAK, BYLINE: When Trump was asked about his health care proposal in the debate last week broadcast on CNN, this is mostly what he talked about.
The protections around pre-existing conditions are still in place in the Senate bill, but the waiver authority gives states options that could include limiting coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, says Pearson.
FENG: It is possible. China's a state-run economy. And so it can tell its state-run firms, which dominate a lot of economic activity, that they need to buy certain things that will probably come at the expense of other countries that sell to China. But what China has kept hinting at is that it will only make such large purchases if it's in its own interest. So it's not entirely clear they will actually make good on this key commitment in the trade truce.
MCCAIN: The moral of story is you should always pay attention to your mother. And certainly, never write something that she might read that you might not want her to.
KIM: Well, yeah, it looks like the news here is the Russian government resigns. But I think the real news is Putin lays the groundwork for staying in power indefinitely. Let's remember that Putin has been in power for 20 years, and his biggest conundrum is how to stay in power after 2024, when his current presidential term runs out.
The battle between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump for the White House is likely to center on the Rust Belt — the industrial Midwest where trade is a big issue for many voters and where the presumptive Republican nominee is predicting he will be able to cut into the Democratic Party's traditional dominance among members of labor unions.
But not everyone is convinced that taxing corporations and the wealthy is the solution.
Hydrogen is pretty well suited to solve a lot of problems at once and really be this unifier between renewable energy and our society's energy needs, Ramsey says. This is a big opportunity for oil and gas companies, but also for electric utilities and renewable developers.
I am reminded of that every time I go back home to Milan and go for a walk. People around the streets, in bars, shops and cafes, are strikingly older than what I'm used to now that I live in New York.
Getting a tax abatement isn't illegal, and in fact they are part of the negotiations in real estate development deals all over the country. But in New York, at least, few developers have succeeded the way Trump has.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, it's been a year since Charlottesville, but it's less than three months until the midterm elections. And the president really isn't shy about tweeting about that. I mean, he's really gone all in to try and insert himself into this race.
Trump himself quickly backed away from the idea. He told CNBC last weekend and CNN today he's not suggesting a debt default, but rather a kind of refinancing.
And now, a glance backward to help inform how to proceed.
Millions of Democrats will join our movement, because we are going to fix the system so it works fairly and justly for all Americans.
If the Republican plan to repeal and replace the ACA goes forward, his options might be more limited than that.

FASO: Well, I'll let the pundits like you talk about that.
Half of the cash will go to the federal government, and half will go back to the state of Alaska.
So Republicans are really upset about this because Trump routinely misses opportunities to focus on Hillary Clinton's troubles, of which there are many including emails between the foundation and State Department officials which also came out this week.
Is a primary just an election that your tax dollars are paying for, and that helps determine who our leaders are? he said. And if so, you tend to think, 'sure, all of us should be allowed to participate in that.'

Some of us, you know, like I would say for me, you know, I work three or four jobs, he said. So, you know, the economy is fine for me. But there's some other people that are actually suffering because of the economy.

Italian authorities responded by canceling soccer matches, closing schools and ordering quarantines in a dozen northern towns.
This stands out. People when they talk about the Koch network ... they point at areas like tax reform, where we've worked very closely with Republican members, said Wadi Gaitan, a spokesman for the LIBRE Initiative. Here on this issue, we have Democrats where we want to make sure that their constituents are aware that they are working on a permanent solution for DREAMers and on border security. So it certainly is a unique effort.
The company's plans to move some 2,000 jobs to Mexico from Indiana was a major campaign issue for Trump, who promised as president he would work to keep manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Now, along with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, the current Indiana governor, reports say they will preserve about half of those jobs.

Out of 175 nations, the U.S. ranks 36th – far behind Singapore, Slovenia, Norway, Sweden and Finland, which round out the top five — and just behind Bahrain and Belarus in the report produced by the advocacy group Save the Children.
After you submit your financial aid application, college financial aid officers have the ability to reconsider aid packages when financial situations change, unexpected expenses emerge, or a person's circumstances are not fully captured on their FAFSA. It's officially called professional judgement, though most refer to it as the appeals process, and it's a power handed down by Congress.
But tomorrow Trump is in Arizona, and that's kind of the flipside. It's a Republican state traditionally, but Democrats are hopeful enough there to invest in offices and run some ads on TV if not doing a lot of on-the-ground campaigning there. But they're hoping that with a lot of turnout from Latino voters based on how many of them view Trump, that they could compete in high turnout.
The bill provides $37 million to the Commodity Supplemental Food Program for low-income seniors.
Under the legislation, an employer cannot require employees to find a replacement worker for themselves or require them to use other paid time off.
The coalition of nonprofits and advocacy groups pushing for paid family and medical leave does have a backstop. Early this year, proponents registered two paid leave ballot measures for the November elections.
We're doing a double-down to try to change behavior to reduce [consumption of] calories and sugar from our beverages, Neely told us. Some of the efforts include offering taste tests and coupons for lower-calorie and zero calories options.

The practice has long been controversial with criminal justice reform advocates who call cash bail a poor people's tax that has had a disproportionately negative impact on people of color. It leaves those who can't come up with the money in jail for weeks or longer or even accepting plea deals as a way to get out.
That sums up the view of 55-year-old Cathy Mottice, a steelworker who has spent 18 years in the plants. When I asked her about the big push Trump is making for white, working-class voters like herself, she had a quick and terse reply:

Still, reversing the Trump administration's environmental rollbacks could potentially take years. The administration will also need the cooperation of Congress to dramatically increase investment in climate policies. Biden says even without Congress, climate will be a priority across all federal agencies.
They covered nearly every domestic area of American law. And one of the pieces of paper that was in that set was a document that was a promotional document to recruit corporations to fund ALEC - to fund its trips for lawmakers, to fund its activities. And that recruitment document, called ALEC 101, said that the public sector and private sector get an equal voice and vote. That was the phrase it used, equal voice and vote.
GROSS: John McCain, I want to thank you so much for talking with us. Thank you for your time.
MONTANARO: They do - but big caveat here, though, is that you haven't seen a lot of scrutiny against Bernie Sanders. Think about his tax plan. The Tax Policy Center came out and said it would cost $18 trillion, for example. You haven't seen any negative ads against him on for precisely the reason that delegate math is decidedly against him.

Republicans say many of the programs included in this bill have nothing to do with addressing the specific demands of the pandemic, like reopening schools and speeding up vaccine distribution.
JOHNSON: Yeah, things became a little bit more clear today. Prosecutor Andres said today, we put Rick Gates on the witness list. We have every intention of calling him. And the judge responded, this is outside the presence of the jury. Well, of course you can't prove the conspiracy charge against Paul Manafort without Rick Gates, his right-hand man.

DONALD TRUMP: And if at the end of 90 days, I fall in short because I'm somewhat politically correct, even though I'm supposed to be the smart one and even though I'm supposed to have a lot of good ideas, it's OK. You know, I go back to a very good way of life.
But other ideas include requiring people to get early ballot envelopes notarized. That's been described by some as a poll tax. And another proposal says you could get an early ballot mailed to you, but you couldn't mail it back. They'd want you to hand-deliver it to a polling place. And perhaps the most controversial ideas would directly impact the presidential election results. One plan would divvy up Electoral College votes by congressional district like Maine and Nebraska. Another would actually let the legislature straight-up revoke the certification of results and let lawmakers pick who gets the Electoral College votes.

3. How is this lawsuit different from previous challenges to the ACA?
For years, that opposition to higher taxes — at least on the middle class — has defined the playing field for American politicians. The Gallup Organization has been asking people since the mid-1950s if they think their own taxes are too high, too low or about right. Almost no one ever volunteers that their taxes are too low.
DETROW: Last question here. Let's look forward a little bit. The president has made it clear he wants to move on to an infrastructure bill next. We have been making cynical jokes about infrastructure bills for five or six years in Washington now. But he's made it clear he sincerely wants it to be bipartisan. What kind of infrastructure bill would you and other Republicans support right now?

MITCHELL: In the policy context, they oppose, essentially, any and every significant proposal to change. And for people like me, we understand that reform is not a direct trade-off with safety and I think understand that the current system is completely broken.
INSLEE: I'll give you a real-world example. And so in Centralia, Wash., we have the last coal-fired plant. We have reached a community agreement to close it in the next few years. In doing so, we've created a $55 million fund that will help with the families and retraining education. It will also help build jobs because training is not enough. You have to have a job.
If this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, you should finally authorize the use of military force against ISIL. Take a vote. But the American people should know that with or without Congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them. If you doubt America's commitment – or mine – to see that justice is done, ask Osama bin Laden. Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell. When you come after Americans, we go after you. It may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limit.

Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman, one of 10 Republicans who met with Biden about crafting a relief bill, acknowledged that direct payments are popular but argued in an interview on Sunday on ABC's This Week, that more than half of the $1.9 trillion proposal won't be spent in 2021, citing a study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. So how could it be about COVID relief? No one expects a year from now that we'll be in the COVID crisis that we're in now, so, it just doesn't make any sense, Portman said.

ELVING: Said he was. Trump repeatedly said, I love WikiLeaks at his rallies during the campaign. That was when Assange was involved in hacking the Democrats' national committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign and so on. Now the immediate charge Assange is facing has to do with the hacking of a Pentagon computer nearly a decade ago - totally different matter - exposing half a million U.S. documents. But since that time, Assange has also been busy, even from his refuge in the embassy, as we know. And there could be more charges. And there could be more revelations about Mr. Assange coming. All we know is, at this point, it capped a wild week at the White House.

Though white evangelical Protestants have been active in pushing for the amendment's repeal, other religious groups have been more likely to test its limits.
And I also think that when you look at a congressional year, when you look at a Congress, you really have two years to get things done. The entire House will be up for re-election next year. A third of Senate will be up next year. And although I've only been there for two years now, I suspect more work gets done during the first year than the second year in a Congress. And so I think the president realizes this and wants to get these three huge items done. And we really don't have time to delay any of them.

It's an illustration of what has happened to India's new farm laws: Any debate over their merits has devolved into political bickering.

If it's an awful job, I just have to get through safe to the end of it.

Donald Trump is facing scrutiny over how much money he has given to his charity, the Trump Foundation, and whether its funds have been used for political gains. NPR's Kelly McEvers speaks with Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold, who has been following this story.
A few weeks ago, this was all much less clear. But Furman was still worried. Before dropping off his kid at school, he typed up an op-ed that he hoped would prevent the public health crisis from spiraling into an economic crisis. The op-ed, which was published March 5 in the Wall Street Journal, called for a comprehensive $350 billion stimulus package. But the part that caught people's attention was his idea to send a $1,000 check to most Americans, plus $500 for each of their kids.
Not only is temporary expensing a budget gimmick, it is also poor tax and economic policy, the group wrote in a recent blog post. It estimated that keeping expensing in place for five years would cost $300 billion, compared with a $900 billion price tag if it were in place for 10 years. (Congress' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation was much more conservative in its estimate, saying five years of expensing would only add $25 billion to the deficit over 10 years.)

It was just about 40 percent in January, and now it's about 43 percent.

And no one realized there was all these people. This small gas tax really affected them because they have to drive maybe 20 miles to get to work. They can't make ends meet every month. And they were furious. And then this morphed into something bigger and bigger every week. This is the 23rd week. And it's a huge movement now of people who feel they've been forgotten.

INSKEEP: I'm going to give you a chance to talk about one idea very briefly. The president is putting out a budget proposal today. And of course, they're dealing with trillion-dollar deficits. We can talk about why; we don't really have time for that - the tax cuts and so forth. But trillion-dollar deficits - that's what the next president would inherit if President Trump is not reelected. Will it be realistic to expand health care in the way you want to do with trillion-dollar deficits?
OSNOS: That's right. That's the - you know, typically that's the traditional answer when somebody is trying to introduce a major new spending initiative while also trying to cut taxes. But historically that has turned out not to be as reliable a formula as it's often described.
And if you're like Senator Mark Kirk in Illinois or Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire or Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and you have to win at suburban voters, swing voters, independents - his kind of comments, incendiary ones, are not helpful.

Steward also says it's working to set up more drive-through testing sites.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., think they have a start to a solution. Thursday they are introducing a framework defining what they call a Green New Deal — what they foresee as a massive policy package that would remake the U.S. economy and, they hope, eliminate all U.S. carbon emissions.
All of this is music to the ears of Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
And you know what? If they do the wrong thing, we should never, ever forget that they did. Never forget. We should never ever forget.
MONTAGNE: Was there a story, along those lines, that stood out for you as the most surprising?
DIONNE: I do, and I don't think it's politics as usual. The law says the Treasury secretary is supposed to turn over Trump's taxes when they are asked for by a congressional committee. He says no. The Congress has a right to hear witnesses. Usually there are - there's a give and take, but usually the witnesses show up. They're saying no Don McGahn, no one else, no unredacted Mueller report. They are pushing Congress to act because if Congress doesn't act, then they are saying, we give into this; we give into our power under Article 1 of the - give in our power under Article 1 of the Constitution. They can't do that.

Your state legislatures said don't do it. They're the only ones that can approve it. They gave tens of thousands of votes. They came in in duffle bags. Where the hell did they come from?
Trump's announcement of Meadows' appointment did not include the acting qualifier.
Yes, so let's take an example. Picture a single mom with a young little toddler and then a daughter who's a second grader. And the mom works around her children's schedule as a home health aide — helping an elderly person get meals, shower and she makes about $10,000 a year. So right now, she receives $600 in child tax credit per child. But under this proposal, she would receive $3,600 for the toddler, $3,000 for her second grader. Each month that would be about $500. And that's food, that's rent, that's clothes. It really could make a difference in those children's lives.
Baily says a big reason is that technology is advancing so fast that it will continue to displace even highly skilled manufacturing workers.

SIMON: NPR's Carrie Kahn. Thanks so much for being with us.
INSKEEP: Let's talk about the politics of this, though, because I'm sure the politics are part of the reason the child tax credit is as it is now. When you have conversations with conservatives talking about tax policy, a lot are in favor of cutting taxes, the government taking less of a person's money. But when you start paying money back to people, particularly poor people, some people have a really strong, visceral reaction to that. What are the politics of this?
If you don't have African-American conservatives willing to stand up to those type of situations, this movement goes down the wrong path and we don't get to maximize it as a holistic nation.
Ocasio-Cortez To Unveil Ambitious Plan To Combat Climate Change
This debate over middle-class taxes is not particular to Sanders and Warren; Kamala Harris' new health plan, which she calls her version of Medicare for All, got attention this week in part because of her promise not to raise taxes for the middle class. In her plan, she said she would impose new taxes on families earning more than $100,000.
DAVIES: You know, here in Philadelphia there were - there was a measure to enact paid sick leave for private employers in the city. It was vetoed twice, I believe, by Mayor Nutter - eventually signed on a third attempt. And this is, you know, a democratic mayor of a city, and he talks a lot about poverty. He's done a lot to fund education. And his argument was - in vetoing the sick leave bill - was yes, it is humane, it's fair, it's rational, it's a good public health initiative.

The government shutdown is inflicting more damage on the U.S. economy than formerly estimated. The president's economists doubled projections of how much economic growth is being lost each week.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: You say this may create more problems than past efforts. Why?
The president's appearance is there to sell his accomplishments, to remind the world that we're open for business, that we're a competitive country, Cohn said.
Attacks like these have prompted the president to move to curtail the immigration system further. His critics argue that doing so emboldens recruitment for those trying to pull off or inspire these kinds of attacks. So that will remain an area of political tension.
KHALID: Well, Rachel, I think what's striking is that so much was about the past. We heard about Iraq - it was relitigating the Iraq war vote even though, you know, we're now nearly two decades since the start of that war. We heard both Sanders and Biden talk about the Vietnam war as well, which kind of highlighted their age.
MOORE: Yeah, he's had fidelity to his tax system.
OCASIO-CORTEZ: I think this is where our style and where our organizing comes in, when everyday people begin to organize, when they make their presence known and their opinions known to their officials. It's the same way that we were able to save the ACA in a Republican majority. It's the same way that we're able to overcome some of those challenges of private industry and the role of money in politics.
California Gov. Jerry Brown left no doubt that the Democratic Party believes that climate change is real.
Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem, Republican President Ronald Reagan said in his first inaugural address.
MARTIN: I mean, we should just point out it wasn't that long ago that there was an overhaul of the American health care system that gave birth to the Affordable Care Act. So - and these Democrats are arguing that didn't go far enough. But this is a very politically difficult issue. I mean, how does it poll with the public? Do Americans want a single-payer system?
In a statement to NPR, campaign manager Kevin Sheekey said Bloomberg staffers are fulfilling Mike's promise to defeat Donald Trump in November, particularly through six battleground states — Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Florida and North Carolina.

Not everyone sees an empathy gap among L.A. residents. L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti says the city's getting more volunteers around homeless causes than ever before. Residents still need a lot of help in their neighborhoods, he says, but they're feeling what they voted for starting to come to fruition.
However, as the first federal returns for 2018 come in, some taxpayers are discovering an unpleasant surprise: Their refunds are smaller than expected. In fact, as of Feb. 1, the average refund is down by about 8 percent from the same time last year, according to the IRS.

And that's certainly a pressing issue. Even though the number of people living in extreme poverty (under $1.90 a day) has declined dramatically over the past few decades from 2 billion in 1990 to 705 million in 2015, the World Bank has warned that progress is slowing. What's more worrying, according to Oxfam, is that while the fortunes of billionaires grew by 12 percent last year according to Forbes (or about $2.5 billion a day), 3.4 billion people who were living on less than $5.50 a day saw their wealth shrink by 11 percent.

For any given product, the women's version costs an average of 7 percent more than similar products for men, the study found. Of the 35 product categories tested, only five did not price higher for the women's version. Personal care products topped the list at an average of 13 percent more for women. Even something as universal as a bike helmet at Target cost $14.99 with sharks on it and $27.99 with unicorns on it, according to the 2015 study.

As noted, for Trump, immigration is tied to national security. So don't expect him to pull back on his push to curtail various programs and make the U.S. immigration system more merit-based.
If a president is cheating the system or evading taxes ... why should any citizen feel compelled to comply? Pascrell said. No one is above the law.
American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world – except when we kill terrorists; or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling. Leadership means a wise application of military power, and rallying the world behind causes that are right. It means seeing our foreign assistance as part of our national security, not charity. When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change – that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our children. When we help Ukraine defend its democracy, or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend upon. When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick, that prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores. Right now, we are on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS, and we have the capacity to accomplish the same thing with malaria – something I'll be pushing this Congress to fund this year.
GREENE: Yeah. More than a hundred cases have been confirmed in that community just north of New York City, making it the largest cluster of cases now in the United States.

The Illinois Pre-Trial Fairness Act, as it's called, is part of Illinois House Bill 3653, a sweeping package of criminal justice measures.

By comparison, just 4 percent of white evangelicals reported having heard their clergy speak in favor of a presidential candidate (2 percent each for Trump and Clinton), while 7 percent heard their clergy speak against a candidate (mostly Clinton).
Winkler says it would take legislative action to get suppressors off the NFA list and that a piece of legislation already exists: the Hearing Protection Act of 2015, proposed in the House of Representatives.

Hours after Trump won last week's election, the NRA dropped this tweet:

We're worried that not every Californian is going to be counted in the census, says Irena Asmundson, chief economist at the California Department of Finance, which is overseeing the state's count through its demographic research unit.

SHAPIRO: Let's look at the map going forward. Even though your surprise win in Michigan was the big headline of the night, Secretary Clinton actually came out of last night's contest with a wider delegate lead than before after her strong win in Mississippi. She's now more than 200 pledged delegates ahead of you, not including the superdelegates. So at some point, in order to secure this nomination, you have to start winning more, bigger states by wider margins than you've been able to do so far. When do you expect we will begin to see that happen?

BUTLER: Absolutely. So Chief Justice Roberts said that Brown v. Board of Education is one of the bedrocks of our democracy. He compared it to Marbury v. Madison. That's the case that established the court as an equal branch of government. So Brown is about our democracy. And in the view of critics of these judicial appointees who refuse to express a point of view, we don't know whether they would vote to overturn Brown. In a sense, overturning Brown would be like overturning America.

COHN: It was written in. And that funding has, you know, has done enormous good when you look at the impact of the law. If you really want to see the impact of the Affordable Care Act just vividly, you know, find a community clinic in your area, one of these federally qualified health clinics, and ask them what the last few years have been like. Between that extra money and just in general, more people getting Medicaid, which they take, these clinics, they can serve many more people. And they've added all kinds of important services. You know, they do addiction counseling. They do diet counseling, things that help them, you know, not just help treat illness, but keep people from getting sick. And especially when you're dealing with communities where you have such high rates of diabetes, hypertension, people aren't getting cancer screenings - this it makes an enormous difference. And it's really a place where you really see what I would say is the best of the Affordable Care Act, where it's really done the most good.
This is called job polarization — the idea that the market for middle-skill jobs has softened, while low- and high-skill jobs have taken off. Economist David Autor and many others have argued that the routine jobs in the middle of the spectrum were being automated away.

So he's got a lot to hide, and that's the message he's sending when he says it's none of your business 'cause it is our business. And he can't get away with that.

But in this case, none of your business - N-O-B is not the answer.

FACT CHECK: Clinton Lays Out Economic Plan In Contrast To Trump
A White House spokesman said one idea taking shape is to apply a 20 percent tax on imports from Mexico, as well as other countries with which the U.S. has a trade deficit. That would effectively saddle U.S. consumers with a significant portion of the wall's cost, estimated at $15 billion or more.

Tonight's order doesn't change the Department of Justice's position on the facts: DACA was implemented unilaterally after Congress declined to extend these benefits to this same group of illegal aliens. As such, it was an unlawful circumvention of Congress, and was susceptible to the same legal challenges that effectively ended DAPA. The Department of Homeland Security therefore acted within its lawful authority in deciding to wind down DACA in an orderly manner. Promoting and enforcing the rule of law is vital to protecting a nation, its borders, and its citizens. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously defend this position, and looks forward to vindicating its position in further litigation.

OSNOS: It would be very, very expensive. Depending on what he does, it could cost hundreds of billions of dollars because, for instance, if they were going to hire the number of what's known in formal immigration literature as apprehension personnel, that would need 90,000 apprehension personnel. That's several times the size of the total number of special agents in the FBI. That's not realistic. So I think more likely they would invoke 287-G which would allow them to draw on other government agencies to do that.
Farmers never really had to do that, he says, if they were selling their crops inside their local Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee, or APMC. Those are the thousands of government-run wholesale markets where Indian farmers typically sell their crops. They are the focus of Modi's new reforms.
I am also proud to be the first president to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave, so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.
It's like a mafia ran this island, and now all of our top officials are either in jail or on trial, says Jurado, a former firefighter and hotel worker who's the vice president of Mallorca's island council. He's a Podemos member.
But soon after the judge issued his order, Manafort's lawyers essentially told the judge never mind and urged the court to keep Manafort in his current jail in Warsaw.
GREENE: So if the most important leader of the country would now be running something like a State Council and would not be president, I mean, it sounds like this could fundamentally change how this country is run, no?
Trump isn't talking about a temporary boost in growth. He says he can make the economy grow in the long term at a rate of about 4 percent a year.
A third thing that would happen - and this is not just for the schoolteacher, but for all kinds of middle-class professionals in Japan - is you have this sense that the prospects for your economy are not very great, and this makes you very risk-averse. Think of the U.S. in the '70s. It's that kind of sensibility that permeated Japan.
The World Health Organization has already urged us to cut back on sugar, limiting added sugars to no more than 10 percent of our daily calories.
On tax policy, views aren't always all that partisan. Democrats are often seen as the party that wants a more progressive system — Hillary Clinton, for example, ran for president in 2016 with a tax plan that would have ramped up taxes for the ultra-rich.
But would a 0.5 percent global tax on the wealthy solve inequality?

Stickler is writing a biography about Bundy and his decades-long fight with the government. The two men met in jail recently, while Stickler was serving a federal prison term for tax fraud. Stickler says he quickly learned that Bundy is a man of conviction, believing so strongly that the government was overreaching he was willing to test federal law.
We need to increase tree cover five times faster than we are, said John Kerry, Biden's special envoy for climate. We need to ramp up renewable energy six times faster. And the transition to electric vehicles needs to take place at a rate 22 times faster.
Congress Changed 529 College Savings Plans, And Now States Are Nervous
Other GOP lawmakers said Democrats have already judged Trump. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., said, President Trump's detractors are going through the stages of grief.
MCEVERS: We just heard the president say, you know, perhaps this was the best thing all along. I've been saying that, you know, that this is the best thing that could have happened. And politically speaking, Sue, I mean, he's been saying this. Does this mean he's wanting to undercut Speaker Paul Ryan and this bill of his?
But a longer-term strategy would be to prepare people for the jobs that will be showing up in the future.

Nordvig says the dollar's decline this year needs to be put in a longer-term context. Its tumble follows a rapid 2 1/2-year climb that peaked around New Year's at highs not seen since the 1980s. So, even with its sharp pullback, the dollar is nowhere near touching new lows.
Neal said the action was about policy, not politics.

But a much more important way the establishment functions is by making endorsements.
A better plan, he argued, would include targeted and timely direct payments.

Satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the Sahel look for water and assisting regulators in West Africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining. It can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters. In some cases, it might help us peer into the future: In December, the World Resources Institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery, in conjunction with other data, to predict water shortages and conflicts.

Other highlights include a proposed moratorium on all new federal regulations and would remove bureaucrats who only know how to kill jobs [and] replace them with experts who know how to create jobs, according to a preview released by his campaign. It's unclear exactly what that means or how it would work, but there are currently about 2.7 million civilian federal employees.
And you know what? We are going to compete and win in the global economy by not letting anybody take advantage of our workers — not China, not Wall Street, not anyone. And we are going to defend and strengthen the tough rules to rein in Wall Street that were put in place after the crash. When corporations paid fines for breaking the law, those fines should cut into executives' bonuses.
Editor's note: NPR fact-checked Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's economic speech on Monday.
The president said he recently signed a bill promoting McGee to the rank of brigadier general and had pinned his new stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office earlier on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, teachers in North Carolina will become the latest to leave their classroom posts and march on their state capitol, wearing #RedforEd T-shirts, in a quest for better compensation for themselves and more resources for their students.

And I was told by the real pollsters — we do have real pollsters — they know that we were going to do well and we were going to win. What I was told, if I went from 63 million, which we had four years ago, to 66 million, there was no chance of losing. Well, we didn't go to 66, we went to 75 million, and they say we lost. We didn't lose.

President Biden is calling for unity to address each of the nation's concurrent crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy, race relations and climate change.
I obviously wanted the money [back] in one shot. But in order to be able to put it onto the books, Allen Weisselberg made the decision that it should be paid in 12 months so it would look like a retainer, Cohen said, adding that everything had to go through Mr. Trump and it had to be approved by Mr. Trump.
Biden acknowledged the effort and compromise needed to eke out Senate approval, and thanked a number of people including Vice President Harris, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democrats. He also credited broad public support, saying, your elected officials heard you.
Well, we obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a 52-48 Senate, McConnell told NPR. We'll have to take a look at what that looks like with a 51-49 Senate. But I think we'll probably move on to other issues.

Facebook says Apple is attempting to push free apps, which often sweep data up and feed it to advertisers, to move to subscription models. Apple, through its App Store, collects a 30% cut of in-app purchases, which critics dub the Apple tax.
KAHN: Well, beginning as soon as possibly next month, Guatemala's agreed to take in asylum-seekers from Honduras and El Salvador. For those Central Americans, Guatemala would be the first country that they transit on their way to the U.S., and they would have to ask for asylum there. If they got to the U.S. border and they had not requested asylum in Guatemala, U.S. officials could return them to Guatemala. Many call this a safe third country agreement, although that wording wasn't in the agreement signed yesterday.
To Schlafly, the establishment was a conspiracy. She described it as a few secret kingmakers based in New York [who] selected every Republican presidential nominee from 1936 through 1960.

But what they can't do, Democrats say, is nothing. They don't want to lay down a precedent that the Congress can't conduct oversight over the executive branch. And that has left a lot of members really frustrated. You have more talk about impeachment now, even though they were pretty comfortable with Nancy Pelosi's formula - let's investigate and legislate and leave impeachment for down the road.
[It] could actually put something like 150,000 people to work and will help pull millions of tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere in years to come, says Mountford.
[Clinton is referring to Mark Zandi here, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. She has brought up the Zandi connection on multiple occasions. Zandi was listed among McCain's advisors on his 2008 campaign, but Zandi also advised the Obama administration on its stimulus package, as the Wall Street Journal reported this year. A search on OpenSecrets.org finds that he contributed to John McCain, but also to several Democrats over the years — including Hillary Clinton last year. All of which is to say that while solely linking him to McCain might imply that he's a conservative economist, that would be misleading. — Danielle Kurtzleben]
Wiles is a regular in the courtroom alongside reporters from mainstream outlets like The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal.

NPR's Rachel Martin talks to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer about federal aid to address the coronavirus' economic impact. The Senate is working on another measure that could total $1 trillion.
The IRS says about 9 million people take the deduction, she reports. And their median income is about $55,000 a year.
It's no secret that many states have badly underfunded their teacher pension plans for decades and now find themselves drowning in debt. But this pensions fight is also complicated by one little-known fact:
DAVIES: And so - well, this is confusing. There are other countries that are parties to the deal, right?
And that says nothing of the need for Congress to pass what may be multiple Houston relief funding measures that will total in the billions. How acrimonious will that become — at least rhetorically — given that some of the conservatives who voted against or spoke out against funding for Superstorm Sandy and other recovery efforts are from Texas?
At the same time, he encouraged people who are set to receive refunds to file earlier so that they can get their money more quickly.
They're always just enough to push Joe Biden barely into the lead. We were ahead by a lot and within a number of hours we were losing by a little.
But now, even to some who decry cancel culture as a problem, the phrase has been overstretched to defend people like Marjorie Taylor Greene who have expressed offensive and violent views.
The income cutoff was lowered after moderate Democrats demanded that the latest round of checks target lower-income families.
But in 2027, those people would be pretty close to the truth (at least, by the center's estimates). In 2027, 53 percent of tax filers would have a tax hike.
PLUTA: Whitmer was a veteran of the Legislature when she ran for and was elected governor. That includes time as the Democratic leader of the state Senate. As minority leader, she put her skills to work to bedevil Republicans, but she never got to serve as a leader in the majority. She plays something of the same role now since the Michigan Legislature is controlled by Republicans. And Republicans have refused her demand to raise the state tax on fuel sales to pay for roads and infrastructure.
Last month, the president held an emotional remembrance to honor the country's 500,000 victims of COVID-19.
The voter-approved amendment, known as the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, required that voters, not lawmakers, have the final say on tax increases, and it capped tax revenue, Jenny Brundin of Colorado Public Radio explained in 2016. Anything the state raised over that cap — typically in boom years — would be refunded to taxpayers.

The slowdown in consumer spending put a dent in overall economic growth. Forecasters at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta lowered their estimate of fourth-quarter growth to just 1.5 percent. If that holds, growth for all of 2018 would fall short of the Trump administration's 3 percent target.
Biden made a $15-an-hour minimum wage — a long-sought progressive goal — a part of his $1.9 trillion economic rescue plan. The House included the increase in the version passed last week with a party-line vote. But the Senate's parliamentarian ruled the proposal doesn't fit within the narrow and complicated rules that govern the chamber's budget measures, which can pass on simple majorities, rather than the 60 votes needed for most other bills to advance.
For example, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who is still in the race, has both a superPAC and a tax-exempt social welfare organization supporting him. (The social welfare group isn't required to disclose its donors.)
Travel stocks have been hit hard by the uncertainty over the coronavirus, which has led conferences to be canceled, universities to close and travel to some nations restricted or barred.
A country that cannot keep its youth is not forward looking, says Nobile. There are more older voters than young, so politicians tend to focus their politics and economic incentives on them. It's a country for old people.
Health policy analysts on both sides of the aisle also still question where health care fits on Trump's priority list.
The legislation allows certain waivers in order to expand who qualifies for benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and suspends the program's work requirements.
At the beginning of this month, most first-time applicants to traditional colleges had to lock down their decisions, including FAFSA applications. Returning students and those at colleges with rolling admissions may still be filling out the form. On Oct. 1, it becomes available for the 2018-2019 school year, hopefully with the Data Retrieval Tool restored.
It's kind of a dying industry, in some sense, Borders says.
The new rules had a quick effect. Great River Energy dropped its plans for wind farms in North Dakota, and moved instead to build them in Minnesota, where wind power could take advantage of another set of transmission lines, which currently carry power from gas-burning plants.
Judges Take Up Big Soda's Suit To Abolish Philadelphia's Sugar Tax
In short, when Republicans didn't hold the White House, Congress voted dozens of times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and now you can't get it done. It will really make us look bad in the eyes of the public, and this unity we have now — House, Senate and the presidency — it could go down. We could lose in 2018, King said, paraphrasing the president.
Schools in four Colorado counties closed Thursday, saying there would be too many teacher absences to properly provide classes. And Denver Public Schools, one of the state's biggest districts, has canceled Friday's classes, citing the number of teachers planning to take the entire day off and adding: This is the case with most of our surrounding districts as well.
I think that the idea always is that once it's in, it'll be very difficult to remove down the road. Neal said. And my plan here is to make sure that the experiment is not only worthwhile, but is lasting.
Now, the people in this area felt that those kinds of per home, per farm investments are OK because what the Internet can do for education and health care is amazing. We just feel it's an investment that the phone companies and cable companies are unable to make. So the folks in this very conservative part of Minnesota decided that they wanted to put their tax dollars on the line and enable this network.
GRAVES: That's what we hear all the time, except for recently.
In addition, FEMA is requesting $47 million for expanded conference
DEUTCH: Well, sure. There are absolutely better ways to accomplish this, and we've tried all of them. We've - if you remember - and the listeners know this. We've tried from the moment the report came out to - since before it came out - to make clear that we deserve the full, unredacted report in order for us to do our job. And despite our requests and despite the ongoing conversations with the Justice Department, the attorney general of the United States simply has refused to turn it over. This isn't our first choice. This is what's necessary at this point because the Justice Department and the president's hand-picked attorney general have refused to cooperate. That's why this is necessary tomorrow.
Several GOP senators have backed an even larger child subsidy.
Locals mostly agree that Americans have been hurt by unfair global trade, but they also plead against tariffs on their local mill.
So if that's what Trump wants, how would this work? It's a complicated proposition, but Dean Baker at the left-leaning Center on Economic and Policy Research explains in a blog post:
COURIC: Yeah, I always say that I started in television when harassed was two words instead of one.
WESSEL: Right. We could flesh out his cabinet with people he sued, plenty of people.
Many of the people that were elected in that room were elected because of Obamacare, and so he was just being realistic, said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., explaining President Trump's pitch.
The Trump administration Thursday did not go that far. Rather, it argued that without the tax to encourage healthy people to sign up, the parts of the law guaranteeing coverage to people who have chronic illnesses or other pre-existing health conditions should be struck down as well.
Carson added: You know, the president's emphasis is on the people.
One in five people in America's workforce identifies as a contract worker, according to a new NPR/Marist poll released Monday. These workers are overwhelmingly male, and most are under 45. Close to half of contract workers say their income changes month to month, or seasonally.
That approach is shared by some moderate members on the committee. Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., a former prosecutor, said he wants to defer to special counsel Robert Mueller when it comes to requesting sensitive documents like private tax returns, to avoid interference with that investigation.
Negotiators have agreed to cut the tax rate for the highest-earning individuals from 39.6 to 37 percent, according to GOP congressional aides. That rate cut, paired with other tax breaks, could dramatically cut tax bills for wealthy earners.

SULLIVAN: I think many, many people are concerned and what their plan is - I don't think anybody really knows what the endgame is. The military said today it will rerun that November election in a year's time. But we'll see. I mean, the military got awfully used to running things in Myanmar for about 50 years before this halting transition to democratic rule. They may decide they just want to do it again. But all of this comes at a time when Myanmar is facing an economic crisis, a COVID crisis, ongoing ethnic insurgencies, new ethnic insurgencies. So it's already a very uncertain time for Myanmar. I don't see this helping.
The biggest internal division right now, says Luntz, is between Republicans who voted for impeachment and voters who opposed it. He found in research this week that 43% of Trump voters say they would definitely vote against any lawmaker who supports impeachment.

And, sure, at this point, you're positioning yourself as a huge tent, not just a big tent. You're trying to be all things to all people. But at some point - and I've certainly talked to Democratic voters about that.
MONTAGNE: The Education Department, the Justice Department warned the states not to discriminate against transgender students or risk losing federal education funds. You're in South Carolina today, where there does not seem to be much appetite for a political fight over this issue. But there's plenty in other states like North Carolina and Texas. Do you think this will become a rallying point for either party in the election?
Norquist has built a career out of getting politicians to swear a blood oath against higher taxes and trying to draw blood whenever they backslide. For Norquist, who heads a group called Americans for Tax Reform, there is no war, hurricane or yawning budget deficit big enough to justify asking the American people to pay more.
But legal documents also revealed that Burke allegedly urged the restaurateurs to give campaign money to Preckwinkle. That revelation and other Preckwinkle-Burke connections, coupled with Preckwinkle's post as the Cook County Democratic Party Chair, left an opening for Lightfoot to paint her as the consummate City Hall insider at a time when voters were hungry for reform.
Still, the 57-year-old Pence is, in many ways, the do-no-harm choice as Trump's running mate. He may not expand Trump's appeal outside the GOP base, but establishment Republicans are comfortable with him, and social conservatives seem to have forgiven him for the fix.
They're mission-driven workers. They have an incredible relationship with the broader community. People love their teachers and nurses for good reason. They fight harder because they're not fighting for a raise, they're fighting over whether we're going to have public education.

Imagine him being in charge when your jobs and savings are at stake. Imagine him trying to figure out what to do in case of an emergency.

[Trump pointed to this table from the Labor Department, and the data do show that 58.5 percent of African-Americans age 16 to 24 aren't in the labor force or are unemployed. It's true that the unemployment rate is higher among black youth than among whites and Asian-Americans. Still, this figure seems high because many 16-to-24-year-old Americans (of any race) aren't in the labor force (for example, because they're in school). Around 49 percent of African American youth aren't in the labor force, by these data, compared to around 45 percent of all 16-to-24-year-olds. — Danielle Kurtzleben]
ELVING: And he may not - we don't know - but he may not have meant it to be quite so blunt a reference to his age.
However, Ashenfelter says, the fast-food workers they studied were still, on the net, much better off. They still get a raise. They just don't get as big a raise as it may seem, he says. In effect, a minimum wage increase appears to be a redistribution of wealth from customers to low-wage workers. Ashenfelter says he thinks of it like a kind of sales tax. And for whatever reason, unlike with many other types of taxes, the minimum wage tax seems to be more popular with voters — even in many red states, like Florida, where they're voting to increase the minimum wage.
Mr. SPIEGEL: People in Old Bridge and in Sayreville, they're being held hostage here. They're not going to be able to sell their houses. They can't use this beautiful beachfront that they spent millions of dollars to renovate. And they're being told to wait because the EPA has to clean up the site.

The trade war has taken a toll on manufacturing, and Boeing's ongoing problems with the grounding of its top-selling 737 Max have also hurt the economy, analysts say.
Emerging from a White House meeting that lasted some 90 minutes, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said they were very excited about the conversation that we had. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called it very constructive, adding that it is clear that Democratic leaders and the president want to get something done on infrastructure in a big and bold way.
Oftentimes, pretty much all the time, I really rely on the recommendations of people who know them, Trump told reporters.
The DGA and one of the casino companies we reached out to disagree and say they take extra steps to ensure that campaign contributions from casinos aren't spent in states where they'd be prohibited.

Trump Threatens Guatemala With Tariffs If It Doesn't Comply With New Asylum Process
We argued that the cost of not doing anything was $800 billion. ... On the other hand, the cost of doing one of our [recommendations] was about $100 to $110 billion — an 8-to-1 return.
So if a tax overhaul has passed — and Ryan can't get his next agenda on entitlements, welfare or health care through the Senate, it does raise the question — does the speaker think about stepping aside in the next few months or after the election?

Trump critic McMullin sees continuity in the former president's rise.
Committees writing the polices need to keep those in mind and so do the senators writing amendments. Senators can challenge measures the run afoul of those rules through a budget point of order.

The Labor Department said Wednesday that consumer prices had risen just 1.7% in the last year — below the Federal Reserve's annual target of 2%.
When Neal made the request last week, he said it was about policy, not politics.
The researchers found that 26,000 deaths could have been prevented following the 2009 peak in unemployment during the last recession had the minimum wage been $2 higher.
DIONNE: Well, first I'm afraid Bethany pointed to something that's exactly right, which is that Republicans clearly want to use this as a political issue in the next election to re-elect Trump and say, well, let's fill the Supreme Court so they will overturn Roe v. Wade. And I think there's no doubt that these laws are being passed because right-to-lifers are hoping that Brett Kavanaugh might go with them on this.
If you were uninsured for only one month in 2017, you won't owe a penalty. People can be uninsured for up to three consecutive months during the year without triggering a tax penalty for not having coverage, says Tara Straw, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
They have these lockboxes. And, you know, they'd pick them up and they disappear for two days. People would say where's that box? They disappeared. Nobody even knew where the hell it was.
DONALD TRUMP: You've given me the honor to lead the Republican Party to victory this fall.
The tax credit, proposed by Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., is available to companies that offer at least two weeks of paid family or medical leave annually to workers; but two key criteria must be met. The workers must earn less than $72,000 a year and the leave must cover at least 50 percent of their wages.
But if the president's legislative agenda continues to be stymied by a strict partisan split, the political pressure will mount on Democratic leaders to reconsider whether they can convince the caucus that the only way to get policy priorities through is to change how the chamber works.
If Democrats are able to pull off wins in any of these contests, the party will be crowing that this spells doom for President Trump and Republicans in the 2018 midterms. And, to be sure, it would be a devastating blow for any House seat this early on in Trump's already-struggling presidency to switch hands — especially ones previously held by his Cabinet members.
A shortage of testing kits is the reason the effort at the Senate requires a private lab, the Oklahoma Department of Health says. The agency says it has about 350 COVID-19 test kits on hand. The state Senate has 48 members.

As the debate rages whether the suicides were provoked by vicious globalization, the company's cynical management, or mollycoddled state workers being made to face up to reality, France Telecom seems to be doing its utmost to avoid another one. One trade union has suggested the government levy a suicide tax on companies to make sure they maintain a decent work environment.
The bill includes a couple of provisions to please abortion rights opponents. Tax credits won't be available to pay for insurance policies if they include abortion coverage.
A lot of other countries do this — I'm not sure Americans realize it — Canada, Australia and most of Europe. This is not uncommon, but, of course, it has not happened here. ... It means that families could make their own choice. There could be a stay-at-home parent. They could use that check to pay their child-care tuition. They could use that check to hire a nanny, whatever they felt worked for their family. And that is something that both sides seem to agree on. Now, of course, $350 a month or so, while it would be very helpful, is not nearly enough to actually cover your whole child-care tuition. So this would not be replacing something like public child care.
Republicans in Congress say cutting corporate taxes would improve the balance sheet for U.S. businesses, giving them more money to spend on jobs and investment.

Introducing them, the president explained that Stephanie Davis was a single mom who was unable to send her daughter to the school she wanted to attend because Pennsylvania's Democratic governor vetoed a bill focused on school choice.

Through some Internet research, she discovered a tool called SwiftStudent that would help her craft a financial aid appeal letter to her college. In it, Harvey requested money for her studies, and outlined all her expenses. It was nerve-wracking to air her personal financial situation. And the stakes were high: If she didn't receive more money, she was afraid she wouldn't be able to pay her tuition bill. Finally, she heard a response: Her appeal had worked. Her college offered her about $2,000 more for the semester. She says that money made a big difference and allowed me to graduate on time.
HORSLEY: Holtz-Eakin says Trump would be better off focusing on what's behind the government's debt, namely the imbalance between government spending and revenue. So far Trump's offered a tax plan that would reduce revenue by an estimated $9.5 trillion over the next decade. And he's ruled out spending cuts to Medicare and Social Security. Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.
Then-President Barack Obama and leaders within his administration reportedly debated a cyberattack or other strategies along those lines to retaliate against Putin in late 2016, but ultimately decided not to attempt it.

All of these tech monopolies are going to abuse their power and interfere in our elections, and it has to be stopped. And the Republicans have to get a lot tougher, and so should the Democrats.

Adding to that challenge, the world is expected to add several billion people in the next few decades, each one producing more emissions.

Trump has also personally threatened to punish the owners of news organizations whose reports have proved embarrassing or critical. Trump threatened to sue The New York Times for reporting on his taxes. Trump said he would sue NBC for the release of the Access Hollywood tape from 2005 in which he bragged of assaulting women by grabbing their genitals and getting away with it because he is famous. (Trump later denied he had ever done so.) In May, Trump suggested to Fox News he might go after Amazon for unpaid taxes or on antitrust grounds because its founder and CEO, Jeffrey Bezos, personally owns The Washington Post.

Outside his office, dilapidated homes and boarded-up storefronts line the broken brick roads of this once booming steel city in Western Pennsylvania. In the busy days, Carnegie Steel housed multiple blast furnaces that melted hundreds of tons of steel a year. Most of that is just a faded memory these days.
Washington, like the rest of the country, has grown more polarized. And either Clinton or Trump will face strong political headwinds from the very first day in office.
Bill and Hillary Clinton have defended the foundation's work under the intensifying attacks. We're trying to do good things, Bill Clinton said Wednesday. If there's something wrong with creating jobs and saving lives, I don't know what it is. The people who gave the money knew exactly what they were doing.

FDA should not provide long-term financial incentives for a treatment that would be very widely used if it works, said Diana Zuckerman, who heads the National Center for Health Research, a consumer advocacy and research organization. The goal of the orphan drug program is to make it more lucrative for a company to develop a treatment that won't have a lot of customers.
The superPAC's advertising and messaging strategy has had its critics. The fundraising strategy was audacious: Pull in millions of dollars in unlimited contributions before Bush even became a candidate. That way he could hit up donors himself, something that the law would prohibit once he announced.

As with the word cancel, both of those terms went from their original meaning to being political weapons used by people claiming concerns about free expression. Political correctness, for example, was an in-joke among liberals before it was a political cudgel.
I was able to use the tax laws of this country and my skills as a businessperson to dig out of the real estate depression when few others were able to do that, Trump said.
The 13-member bipartisan panel spent months poring through examples from other states and studies that looked at the costs and benefits of providing family and medical leave. They reviewed more than 1,000 public comments submitted in just 30 days.
However, Ryan was working with President Trump, who wanted a tax cut for corporations. Ryan said the bill was designed as a middle-class tax cut, but the core of the resulting bill is really the corporate tax cut. Republicans also were determined to lower tax rates for the wealthiest individuals and abolish the estate tax, paid only by individuals who leave more than $5.49 million to their heirs.
The bankers represented by Pomerantz made a similar calculation when they allowed Trump to sell off the assets he could no longer afford.
The report focused on less-educated adults because that group is more likely to earn the minimum wage. That group is also at a higher risk of depression and suicide, says Kaufman. Raising the minimum wage did not seem to affect whether college graduates would die by suicide.
BENSON: Oh, I think it was a difficult task for him, as he found out very early on. And what strikes me about the audio soundbite that you just played was a tweet from the president this morning claiming, quote, total and complete vindication. That did not sound like total and complete vindication, the FBI director explicitly calling you a liar under oath. I do think Trump has a point, though, that there was at least partial vindication.
COHN: A pandemic really holds up a mirror to our health care system. And so, you know, one way to look at it is we still have millions of people uninsured. We have people with insurance with really big deductibles, can't get to the doctor. So, you know, in one way, you could say, gee, this shows all the inadequacies of the Affordable Care Act. The flip side is if you imagine a world where we don't have the Affordable Care Act in place, there would be so many more people who didn't have health insurance. There would be so many more people with insurance that had, you know, high deductibles, couldn't get to a doctor.
OSNOS: Yes, he can. What he has said he wants to do is renegotiate the deal with Iran, and renegotiate is a sort of a flexible word. It's not clear what he means entirely. But were he to try to reopen that deal, that could actually - that could really change the course of things more broadly beyond just the Iran deal because at that point what happens is that Iran - and Iran specialists told me as much months ago - would regard the United States seeking to renegotiate the deal as an abrogation of the deal.

And they don't look ready to do so any time soon, especially with Obama still attached to the law's name.
HORSLEY: You're right. I mean, North Korea is already cut off from much of the world's commerce as the international community tries to discourage growing Pyongyang's nuclear program. But the North Koreans have managed to evade some of those sanctions with illicit ship-to-ship transfers on the high seas of things like coal or petroleum. So that's what the U.S. is now targeting with these new sanctions, more than 50 vessels and shipping companies that have taken part in that illicit ship traffic. The U.S. is also sending out a warning to shippers around the world not to do business, even in secret, with the North Koreans.
PAVIOUR: And just another interesting issue here is that just six months ago, Virginia reduced the penalty for marijuana possession to a $25 citation. An analysis we did at VPM showed that Black people are still four times more likely to get cited for possession than white people.
You know, one of the documents that we're looking at here is a handwritten note by Parnas on stationery from that Ritz-Carlton in Vienna. And it reads, get Zelenskiy to announce the Biden case will be investigated. There's also a letter in there from Giuliani to Zelenskiy trying to set up a meeting with the Ukrainian president. And in that letter, Giuliani says he's acting with Trump's knowledge and consent. So this is adding more detail to a narrative that has been pretty well fleshed out in the House investigation...
MANN: And under tentative terms of this deal, Cardinal Health and these other three big companies, they're not expected to admit wrongdoing, but they could pay out as much as $26 billion. That's money that would go to help communities slammed by the opioid crisis.

FOWLER: So Delta would only gain about $40 million in this tax break. And to put that in context, Delta just shared $1.1 billion with employees in profit-sharing a few weeks ago. So Delta wouldn't really miss that money.
CARY: It's a very big challenge right now because they're trying to harness the energy of the base and turn it into a legislative agenda. And that is proving almost impossible. There is no Populist wing of the Republican Party in the House or Senate. There is across the country but not in the House and Senate. And that to me is where the big disconnect is happening. And it is extremely frustrating for Republicans, like the rest of us out here, to watch the lack of inability to harness that energy into a legislative agenda.

On the whole, teachers who don't get Social Security aren't necessarily disadvantaged if they work a full career and get a full pension, says Andrew Biggs, who studies retirement issues at the American Enterprise Institute.
One other element of the Trump plan is worth noting: It would eliminate the federal estate tax entirely. Only the wealthiest taxpayers — less than 1 percent — now pay that tax. Ending it would lead to an even greater concentration of wealth in the U.S.

Why? A, because they carved the number 18 into the back of Jefferson Davis' jacket on his statue in the middle of campus, B, because the campus speed limit at Ole Miss is at an annoyingly-slow 18 miles per hour in his honor or C, because to this day you can buy his favorite meal - a dozen boiled crawfish and a can of Abita beer for 18 cents.

But that mandate was crucial to persuading insurers to offer plans under the ACA. It helped expand their risk pools while the law forced them to guarantee coverage to any customer. Insurers were not allowed to raise costs for people with pre-existing medical conditions. The administration's legal brief, filed Thursday in federal district court in Fort Worth, Texas, takes aim at those links.

In Philadelphia, you had a situation in which that mayor, you know, ultimately changed his mind - perhaps in view of his legacy. And after vetoing that paid sick measure at the local Chamber of Commerce there, he was ultimately convinced to allow this measure to go into effect and allow people to have paid sick leave. I think you have a situation where these measures are extremely popular and - in fact, in many employers, they're the norm, to have paid sick leave.

Questions abound about whether it was the campaign, the superPAC or, as is usually the case, the candidate himself who was to blame. Bush has been criticized for being too slow to respond to a campaign that was different from the one he — and almost everyone else — expected. No one foresaw the political force Donald Trump would be, and Bush — and every other candidate, for that matter — had difficulty knocking the seemingly underqualified Trump off stride.

Raids like that are ominous for the supporters of Washington's regulated pot system.

And we had a window of opportunity to rebuild the infrastructure and address some of the problems that faced the country, and they didn't do it.
Trump is the first president in 40 years not to release any of his tax returns during the campaign. Now lawmakers in dozens of states have introduced bills that would force him to do so. Several of these bills go by the name Tax Returns Uniformly Made Public, or TRUMP Act.

And even though we're not physically together, I think just reminding him that what he's doing is really important. And I think our children someday will really recognize what he's given up, this sacrifice for the community, and just how important that is. And so though it's really hard right now, I think in the long term, this will be OK, and the kids are going to understand.

However, extremes make averages, and the benefits would be much larger for richer households. A household earning $1 million or more would get an average cut of $69,660, an income bump of 3.3 percent. Compare that with the a tax cut of $870, or 1.6 percent, for the average household earning $50,000 to $75,000.
Meanwhile, in Colorado, teachers gathered outside the state's Capitol in Denver, where thousands of demonstrators have kicked off two days of planned rallies.

These are payments the government makes to insurance companies as reimbursement for discounts on copayments and deductibles the companies are required by law to give to low-income customers. President Trump has said he wants to end the payments — which a court has ruled are unlawful since Congress never authorized them. But now lawmakers, including Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the health committee, say they want Congress to fund the payments through next year.

The bill included a provision that would gradually increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025. But that's likely to be stripped out of the Senate version because on Thursday evening, the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian ruled that including this provision violated budgetary rules. While the ruling disappointed some progressives, the decision spared Democrats in the Senate from internal conflict over whether a $15 minimum wage is too high.

Retailers had reported robust sales in the first half of the holiday season. But consumers grew more cautious when a political standoff over border wall funding temporarily shuttered parts of the federal government just before Christmas. This followed a roller-coaster ride on Wall Street, as investors worried that trade tensions between the U.S. and China would cut into corporate profits.

It's not clear whether Mnuchin's announcement has any bearing on state tax filing deadlines, and the Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Some states have already extended their deadlines.
INSKEEP: ...Puts a different cast on all of this because he is saying, recently, that any reductions we have an upper-income taxes will be offset by less deductions so there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class, people on the top. He says we'll be paying about the same. Are you comfortable with that?
FOLKENFLIK: Well, Trump will make an announcement to step on the momentum of a rival. You saw that with Marco Rubio starting to pick up steam at one point early in the primaries. And suddenly, Trump pulled the Chris Christie announcement of an endorsement out of thin air seemingly. And he had been holding that back. He had, I believe, hoped to do that at a later moment. But that was the right time. And he also will say things that are insulting. What it does is it directs attention away from other candidates who may be trying to get airtime for their policy proposal, their positions, their candidacies. And it really kind of hijacks the news cycle. I think it has also hijacked the attention of the press to the extent that for many months, they weren't giving Donald Trump the kind of due diligence, the kind of tough scrutiny in his business life that you would give to a politician for his earlier political life. And I think Trump did that by feeding the press so much. It was irresistible to the press. The ratings show it. The clicks show it. This will be a time of high profits for cable news. But it meant that, for many months, he was able to escape different kind of scrutiny that I think would have served the voter better.

As companies come under pressure to support workers, some are going further.
Trump is set to take office at a tricky time for the health law, with many Americans in both parties complaining about rising premiums and other out-of-pocket costs. The Republican-led Congress has refused to make changes to the law that would help it work better — such as offering a fix when insurers cancelled policies that individuals thought they would be able to keep. As staunch opponents of the law, they, of course, have little incentive to improve it.
I think that health care is just a mess, and he's obviously trying to move something forward on that. And I think that everyone needs to be behind the president and working together to get this taken care of for the people. Whether it's eradicating Obamacare or making something new, the people are suffering, and we need to be united and be behind the president to help the people. And so I think he's really trying to move that forward. So I'd give him a lot of progress points on that.
But think of what happens. Let's say they're stiffs and they're stupid people, and they say, well, we really have no choice. Even though Pennsylvania and other states want to redo their votes. They want to see the numbers. They already have the numbers. Go very quickly. And they want to redo their legislature because many of these votes were taken, as I said, because it wasn't approved by their legislature. You know, that, in itself, is legal. And then you have the scam, and that's all of the things that we're talking about.

In an evenly divided chamber, any one senator can wield influence and press for a pet issue or program that specifically has an impact in their state. As the package moves to the floor and senators from both parties press for amendments, potentially to how the tax credits are structured, that could change those items that many House Democrats insist should stay as is. The parliamentarian can also rule that some items aren't within the scope of the reconciliation process. There is already tension from progressives who complain that moderates shouldn't be given an outsized role in shaping policies that Biden campaigned and won on in 2020.
What are the specifics of that framework?
If we start to examine what have been the outcomes of the history of slavery and legal segregation and discrimination, you can look at the fact — and anyone can tell you who's a mental health specialist — that when people have experienced trauma, and it has been undiagnosed and untreated, you will see certain public health outcomes. And so if you recognize the trauma that existed, and we want to end what are avoidable health outcomes, you need to put resources — and direct resources, extra resources — into those communities that have experienced that trauma. ...

Now, I have to say she is the most transparent justice on the court. She is the one who when she gets sick tells you what's going on in statements about her medical care. She's the first justice who when she made a mistake - a minor error, but an error nonetheless - in the Supreme Court opinion in the - and - it was going to be corrected in the final opinion.

When we look back on the role that sites like Twitter, Facebook (and Instagram and Snapchat and all the others) have played in our national political discourse this election season, it would be easy to spend most of our time examining Donald Trump's effect on these media, particularly Twitter. It's been well-documented; Trump may very well have the most combative online presence of any candidate for president in modern history.

To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things. We must have the best, absolutely the best gathering of intelligence anywhere in the world. The best. We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, in Libya, in Egypt and in Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly. We're going to win. We're going to win fast.

The health law isn't as prescriptive with large-group plans about the specific benefits that have to be offered. They aren't required to cover the 10 essential health benefits that individual and small-group plans have to include, for example. But the law does require that big companies offer plans that meet a minimum-value standard, paying at least 60 percent of the cost of covered services, on average. Those that don't could face a fine.

And Yentel says she's struck by something else. This affordable housing program has been popular for decades: Liberals get the housing that they want built and corporations get tax credits.

So Yentel says It's very surprising that the House tax bill targeted the program in this way.

And the National Restaurant Association handed out a map of other cities that were considering or had adopted paid sick leave measures. And the legislators were told that in essence, they should be moving to preempt those measures wherever they are and try to thwart them wherever they could.
ROBERTS: It's been standard from Nixon on for presidents and presidential candidates to let the public see what they've paid, but not everyone has handled it the same way. Gerald Ford, Nixon's successor, provided a summary of his taxes. Some candidates have just turned over a couple of years' worth of documents. Others have provided returns for many years. But none has totally stonewalled the way Trump has.
It's diversity of producers. It's diversity of size. It's diversity of methods of production. It's diversity of crops being produced. It's across the board. And a diversity of income opportunities.
The first three contests in the Democratic primary seem like a lifetime away. Joe Biden did so badly in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada that political pundits started to talk about whether he would ever be able to turn it around. He did just that on Super Tuesday and again in primaries last night.
A Congressional Budget Office analysis found 14 million fewer people would have health coverage almost immediately if the GOP bill is passed, with that number rising to 24 million fewer people insured by 2026. It also found that insurance premiums would initially rise before falling by 10 percent in later years.
HORSLEY: The immediate focus is his living arrangements last year when Pruitt rented a room in an apartment on Capitol Hill. Now, according to Bloomberg and ABC, he paid the landlord $50 a night but only for the nights he was actually in town. So his overall cost appears to be well below what he would've paid to say rent an apartment by the month in the neighborhood.
DETROW: You know, I'll admit - and I know our bosses are listening, so I will say that this does not take up too much mental energy on debate nights - but on debate nights, I've got a side passion project.
Like Hansen in the 1930s, Summers points to declining population growth as one source of stagnation. But he also points to other factors. A big one: Our economy might require less investment than it used to. Think Kodak (the old economy) vs. Instagram (the new economy). Kodak required factories and assembly line workers and trucks and film and film developers and a bunch of other resources to give us photography. Instagram basically needs just an office with laptops and a few hundred smart workers. It needs much less investment.
BALABAN: Pours into a tub and mixes it with...
You have care providers who are working at below poverty wages, you have parents who can't afford the care and you don't have a robust ecosystem of facilities because it's a low-margin business with high liability, said Ivanka Trump on the sidelines of a discussion she recently led at the White House with about more than a dozen people who specialize in child care. So, it's like just a fundamentally flawed system.
SIMON: Let's try and understand this item by item, if we can. What portion of the tax cut goes to corporations?
The neutral rate is a theoretical resting place for interest rates. And the Fed doesn't control it. Putting a number on it is a guess, or a moving target. It's basically the interest rate in the economy's sweet spot. It's where the cost of borrowing money makes everything hum nicely. Basically everyone is employed if they want to be. All factories and machinery and technology are put to use. And the price of everything is pretty stable (not a lot of inflation). Not too hot. Not too cold. It's the natural or neutral place to be.
In fact, other businesses here did worse because Donald Trump acted so irresponsibly. He calls himself the King of Debt, and he earned that title right here in A.C. His bad decisions hurt the whole city.

As Trump left the meeting, he predicted, We're going to have a real winner. But then he added, There are going to be adjustments made, but I think we'll get the vote on Thursday.
CORNISH: Now, as we said, she is calling this her jobs tour, though. So what did she say specifically about her own plans to help the economy?
This episode originally ran in 2014.
A central question of debate leading up to the Senate's passage of a sweeping tax overhaul plan asked which Americans need a boost. Economists say the Republicans' selling point for previous iterations of their legislation, that the plan is designed to benefit the middle class, has a shaky foundation — that the rich are the big winners.
As part of this reform, we will eliminate the Carried Interest Deduction, a well-known deduction, and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers. Tax simplification will be a major feature of the plan. Our current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste 9 billion hours a year in tax code compliance. My plan will reduce the current number of brackets from 7 to 3, and dramatically streamline the process.
In an email, Fidelity Charitable told NPR that it took the report's findings very seriously, adding that, if there are concerning reports identified regarding a specific charity, and Fidelity Charitable determines [that] grants to an organization are not used exclusively for charitable purposes, Fidelity won't approve grants to that organization.
SIEGEL: Well, if I were a middle-class Japanese, say, schoolteacher, how different would my life be today because of the economic problems in Japan than they might have been to a similar schoolteacher 20 years ago?
Upon taking office, the Trump administration rescinded the Obama directive, but some leaders at Christian schools still fear the cultural and legal trends are in favor of expanded LGBT rights on their campuses, which could mean their policies on sexual behavior could face serious challenges.
KEITH: But, you know, what is great about a messy bedroom is there are more clothes on the floor to dampen the sound and make it sound more like a studio.
Editor's note: An early version of this story published before all the court documents in the case were available contained a characterization from a person familiar with the case that said Manafort's cooperation would be limited. When charging documents and other materials appeared, they did not support that and the characterization was removed.

OSNOS: Well, as a candidate and before, Donald Trump has expressed a lot of skepticism about climate change. He's called it a hoax. At one point, he described it as a hoax that was perpetrated by the Chinese in order to try to undermine American competitiveness. He later said that was a joke. Since Election Day, some of the appointments that he's made have made clear that he's going to make good on his belief that American energy policy and attempts to combat climate change are going in the wrong direction. So, for instance, Donald Trump's transition team for the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency is run by somebody named Myron Ebell who has been really one of the most outspoken skeptics of climate change, runs a program here called the Competitive Enterprise Institute, and it opposes regulation. It's not clear exactly who funds it, but in the past, it was funded by fossil fuel companies including Exxon Mobil and others.
YGLESIAS: Yeah. I mean, I think that we saw pretty clearly in that testimony that, you know, Republicans are interested in the sort of narrow question of did the president break a bright-letter law? It seems like, you know, probably he didn't. He's allowed to fire the FBI director. And they are fundamentally not concerned about what I think to a normal person looks like a broader question of really odd behavior around the nation of Russia and around the question of this Russia investigation.
Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, shortly after leaving the helm of the Fed, wrote that he was pretty exasperated by the general public's failure to grasp just how limited the Fed's power is. Bernanke wrote: If you asked the person in the street, 'Why are interest rates so low?', he or she would likely answer that the Fed is keeping them low. That's true only in a very narrow sense.
In the state of Arizona, over 36,000 ballots were illegally cast by non-citizens. Two thousand ballots were returned with no address. More than 22,000 ballots were returned before they were ever supposedly mailed out. They returned, but we haven't mailed them yet.
That kind of involvement by young people isn't new, Taft says. But what has changed, she says, is that today's social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other. With their phones set to retweet, they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away.
But every kind of person, every race of person who's low income is affected by this. Now we're getting to what the Biden administration wants to do different when they talk about making this tax credit refundable, what does that mean?
Much of the mob that stormed the Capitol echoed Trump's talking points, which were only amplified by conservative media in the runup to the Jan. 6 violence.

Pence may have to use that talent for evasion in the coming campaign. He has taken many positions, some reflected by his votes in Congress, that are dramatically different from Donald Trump's.
The superPAC's biggest failure: It took months to figure out how to deal with Trump's precedent-breaking candidacy. Other candidates were equally slow on the uptake. In the Bush operation, the result was that as Trump grabbed all the media attention, Right to Rise USA was spending its TV budget on soft-sell biography spots when it could have been attacking front-runner Trump.
Hot spots include Burkina Faso, where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people; the Philippines, where a Christmas Eve typhoon killed more than two dozen; and Venezuela, where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years.

Before everything great that has ever happened, the doubters have always said it couldn't be done. America is ready to prove the doubters wrong. They want you to think small. I am asking you to think big. We are ready to dream great things for our country once again. We are ready to show the world that America is Back – Bigger, and Better and Stronger Than Ever Before. Thank you, and God Bless You.

Ko says there is a work-life balance in France that keeps entrepreneurs from burning out.
Republicans say the power escalation goes all the way back to the 1980s, and they point fingers at Democrats, who blocked a Supreme Court nominee back then. As a result of getting rid of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, McConnell got a more than 200 federal judges through and three Supreme Court justices.
It's like we're taking our power away as citizens, she continues, because we don't get to opt out, and everybody else can use it for whatever reason, whether it's good or bad.
YDSTIE: Well, there's no doubt that Walmart and many other companies are very happy that the top corporate tax rate was slashed from 35 to 21 percent. It'll save Walmart billions of dollars a year. And it certainly makes it easier for the company to raise its minimum wage to 11 bucks an hour. But there are other forces at work here that have little to do with the tax cut.
In the absence of a direct answer to why there is a relationship between increasing the minimum wage and lower suicide rates, Kaufman is planning future work to see whether depression, a risk factor for suicide, also decreases with wage hikes.

In his 100-day action plan, Trump promised to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting. During his campaign, he also condoned other extreme counter-terrorism tactics, like waterboarding.
Dollar for dollar, this might be the most misguided part of the plan, she says. What you're doing is increasing the cost of going to graduate school ... and ignoring the fact that the government makes much more money if people have more education.
SAGAL: Oh, my gosh. All right. Here we go, Roxanne. This is for the game. According to a poll released Thursday, 60 percent of Americans oppose Trump's pardon of blank.
A better solution, according to Shabo and others, would be to provide a paid family leave benefit that's funded by employer and/or employee payroll contributions. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., last year reintroduced such legislation. Their bill would guarantee workers, including those who are self-employed, up to 12 weeks of family and medical leave with as much as two-thirds of their pay.

And Notre Dame, this week - everyone was sad about that. The yellow vest people were sad about it. They cried. But, you know, they said, but within two days, they raised a billion for a cathedral, and we can't get anything. We've been protesting for months. And we can't make ends meet. You know, we don't even have enough food to put on the table. I don't know if they're exaggerating or not. But - and they're angry now. And there's this anger of the inequality in France - the billionaires who can rebuild Notre Dame, but they don't care about the little people. And the man, they say, who is responsible for all this is President Emmanuel Macron.
Meanwhile, over the last decade, a McFlurry of cities and states has been raising their minimum wages. In their new study, Ashenfelter and Jurajda use McDonald's restaurants as kind of like treatment and control groups to assess the impact of these new minimum wage laws. They obtained data on hourly wage rates of McDonald's Basic Crew employees, the prices of Big Macs and other information from about 10,000 McDonald's restaurants between 2016 and 2020. And they crunched the numbers to see what happens when a city or state increases its minimum wage.
At the regular monthly meeting of Local 1123, union officials were talking about the need to mobilize on behalf of candidates who support labor's agenda on trade, the right to organize and pushing for an increase in the minimum wage nationally.

That episode proved to be a preview in microcosm of the broader active measures the Russians launched against the West and which continue today.

While states and cities with more than 500,000 residents got direct assistance in the CARES Act passed last spring, most cities and towns, including Dayton, had to wait for it to trickle down through their states and counties. The deadline to spend it isn't until the end of this year, so some are trying to make it last as they manage strapped budgets.

The first group to attack Trump was Club For Growth Action, the superPAC arm of the advocacy group for supply-side economic policies and smaller government, in 2011. CFG considers Trump much too fond of government assistance, from the Wall Street bailout to single-payer health insurance and eminent domain – the power to condemn property for development.

She took credit for speeding the naming of the building for a couple of agents who had sacrificed their lives. The White House was also poking fun at the congresswoman's dress and hat. And this just turned out to be the sort of thing that, if they were trying to distract from the original questions about what these soldiers were doing in Niger, why we were suddenly taking casualties in this part of the world where most people don't think the United States is engaged - and of course, the controversy over why it took so long for the president to acknowledge these deaths or to say anything to the families or to send any kind of message to them at all - if that was the purpose, well, I guess that has been accomplished.

WARREN: No, I think that every step of the way, the president has tried to protect Mike Flynn. And then when it became - what? - this was late January, early February of this year.

I think this is something we have to think about as being less strategic and more situational from the president - the president seeing another way for him to put distance between himself.

Millennials are looking at the issue of gay marriage, and more and more they are saying, 'OK, we know the Bible talks about this, but we just don't see this as an essential of the faith,'  says Brad Harper, a professor of theology and religious history at Multnomah University, an evangelical Christian institution in Portland, Ore.
The main way the Fed influences interest rates is very narrow, usually through a policy lever known as the federal funds rate. It's the rate banks charge each other to borrow money overnight. By making it cheaper for banks to borrow, it makes it cheaper for businesses and households to borrow. That is the traditional way the Fed has tried to boost the economy. It injects more money into the system.
What do you think about a provision of this tax proposal that would make it a monthly payment for people? Instead of getting one check sometime after April 15, they'd get 12 across the course of the year.
A Republican Congress can act as a check against an authoritarian executive branch, as you've seen between Republican Congress and President Obama's executive actions. So I think it's going to be in the best interest of the country to have a divided government at the national level and then have offset balances at the state level.
CORNISH: How much coordination is there between these teachers unions in these different places?
I work at the YMCA Monday through Friday with kindergartners through fifth graders. It's split shift; seven to nine, two to six daily, he says. With the rest of my day, I also work at a local pizza place. And in addition to that, I also own and operate a small skateboard company.
HORSLEY: Right. Investors were poised to dump stocks just as soon as the market opened this morning. And very quickly, the S&P 500 index fell 7%. That's the trigger for a 15-minute halt to trading. We saw one of those earlier this week. And so trading was suspended for 15 minutes. When it restarted, stocks did stabilize a little bit. Right now the S&P is still down right around 7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average - just checking my screen - is down about 8% as of this moment. So we're not seeing the really rapid decline. But remember, it was just yesterday that the Dow crossed into bear market territory for the first time in 11 years.
[This is a key part of Clinton's economic message. She talks regularly about advanced manufacturing, visiting factories around the country to promote the idea that although American manufacturing won't return to what it once was, it could be something new, more efficient and innovative. This is quite a contrast with Trump's pledge to reopen steel mills that were shuttered a generation ago and bring the coal industry back to what it once was. -Tamara Keith]
China quickly retaliated with tariffs of its own on U.S. exports including soybeans, medical equipment and petroleum products.
Put another way, in 2018, households earning $1 million or more — or, 0.4 percent of all tax filers — would be getting 16.5 percent of the total benefit from the bill.
Warren told WLRN that the process in Hillsborough was methodically developed in close coordination with other parts of the local government, including the 13th Judicial Circuit of Courts, in order to make sure it was in compliance with state law. The program took into account a federal court ruling in a lawsuit related to SB 7066, the law authored by Grant.
Stan is volunteering with us, too, because he — like so many people across Ohio and across the country — knows that we are fighting for a better future.

The law had an automatic exemption for houses of worship, like churches — but not for nonprofits like religious schools and hospitals, NPR's Nina Totenberg explained last year. Those nonprofits were given a workaround to accommodate their objections, but some say that accommodation still burdens their free exercise of religion.

'Selfish' Giving: Does It Count If You Get In Return?
GRAVES: This is a new trend. And it's a growing trend, where we see state legislatures intervening in local actions on a variety of issues, including local measures to increase minimum wage, to provide for paid sick leave for workers, to address fracking - which involves the hydraulic pressure drilling for natural gas in people's backyards almost literally. You also see measures, for instance in Tennessee, where a city wanted to try to ensure that there were rewards for contractors who employed low-income workers or a small percentage - 10 percent - of low-income workers. That was preempted.

What tax rate is he paying? What deductions and loopholes is he taking advantage of? How are the kinds of tax policies that he's thinking about acting on as president affecting him personally? says Bookbinder, whose government watchdog group has sued the president, saying Trump's foreign business dealings violate the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution.
He added that we must not repeat the same mistake of 12 years ago when Democrats agreed to a stimulus many considered too small in order to gain Republican support.
It's been about four decades since we've seen such strong growth in real GDP, he said. But you have to remember that we're coming out of a very deep hole when it comes to the damage that's been done by the COVID crisis.

ESPUELAS: I disagree with that only because I'm a pragmatist, and, at the end of the day, Congress has to pass laws in order for the president to sign it. And he can give as many speeches as he wants. At the end of the day, if the House of Representatives does not take up the Senate immigration bill, modify it, do whatever they want with it, but take it up and have a vote, there is no bill to sign. And no amount of speechifying on the part of the president will really change that dynamic. So, at the end of the day, Boehner has to open up the floor of the House to an open vote. There will be an almost unanimous Democratic support for it and probably about 30 percent of Republicans will support it, as well. It will pass. The president will sign it. We'll be done with this issue. Eduardo will have a path toward citizenship, and our country will be better for it.

The Jonah Field is one of the most productive federal drilling lands in the country. But in the last few years, things have gotten tough. When prices were high, companies drilled a lot, but now there's a glut. Prices tanked and the pandemic has made that even worse. Locally, people are getting laid off, and Anderson recently had to cut the aquatic center's budget by almost half.
The Bank of England was the latest central bank to lower rates, announcing an emergency 0.5-percentage-point cut on Wednesday. It said the cut will help to support business and consumer confidence at a difficult time, to bolster the cash flows of businesses and households, and to reduce the cost, and to improve the availability, of finance.

A spokesperson for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. confirmed to NPR over email that his office obtained the records on Monday. That same day, the U.S. Supreme Court declined Trump's request to further delay the enforcement of a subpoena, paving the way for a New York grand jury to obtain and review the sought-after financial documents.
Trump signed an executive order that says for every regulation the executive branch proposes, two others must be repealed.

Why did Putin order the campaign of active measures that have been directed against the United States and the West since before the 2016 election?
ELVING: And let's face it - this was three hours long. It took some energy just to watch it.
KING: Rachel, I wonder how that's been for you. You have a newborn and - do I have this right? - a 4-year-old and a 6-year-old.
SIMON: Well, you know, Trump claims he wants to, too. And he did it in that speech. However, the problem is he has that signal-and-noise issue all the time. He's got to learn to conquer that. I mean, he's capable of doing it because he does it. But then, all of a sudden, he explodes.
ROCCA: Well, a Trump associate wanted Russia's help.
Republican lawmakers universally opposed the plan in the House and the Senate, criticizing the proposal as a Democratic wish list with few provisions related to COVID-19. Meanwhile, Democrats have praised the bill's potential to create a new social safety net.
The bill will direct a new round of aid to Americans — in the form of direct payments, extended unemployment benefits, an expanded child tax credit and more — almost a year after the pandemic first upended daily life in the United States.
Is this the time for that kind of observation?
Inskeep: Is there a federal equivalent [to California's moratorium on the death penalty] that you would do? Federal executions, of course, are quite rare.
GINGRICH: Yeah. But what I said to them was, that in agreeing - we all agreed to go to Israel for the prime minister, for his funeral because he'd been assassinated.
To more liberal Democrats, the prospect of such an ambitious economic and environmental package at the center of the 2020 campaign may be particularly energizing.
In choosing Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate, Donald Trump has reassured both establishment republicans and social conservatives — but he has also picked someone who in many ways is his polar opposite.
KING: Rachel, I want to ask you - when you hear Justin talk about what's going on at work, I'm sure you worry. But I also wonder, is there some part of you that sort of wishes you could be doing your job? I know we've heard from a lot of people who say being cooped up in the house means extra time with the kids. And that is lovely. But frankly, I'm a professional. You're an epidemiologist. Do you have that frustration?
At the beginning of his tenure, she observes, Pence, like Daniels, avoided social issues and focused on economic development, tax cuts and jobs.
Cagle is a leading candidate to succeed Gov. Nathan Deal.
In its report, the committee proposed the kind of monthly benefit that Democrats and Romney are now embracing. Both plans are estimated to cost between $110 billion and $120 billion, though Romney has proposed offsetting much of that cost by cutting other safety net programs.
Mr. McALLISTER: Well, my message is trying to clarify the imagery of taking back America and what that needs to mean. And one of the speeches that I will be giving talks about what TBA means, which is Take Back America, versus TEA, Taxed Enough Already. And making sure that people understand that that TBA means taking it back from expansive government, not necessarily taking it back from the first black president or taking it back from an expanded role of women or taking it back from immigrants, because that is the wrong message.
CAMPBELL: The governor's critics in education aren't impressed and are appealing to voters directly. For the second time since 2018, they're pushing a ballot measure to raise taxes on the wealthiest Arizonans. They say it would generate about $940 million a year. Teachers union president Joe Thomas.

Sen. Raphael Warnock, one of two Georgia Democrats elected in a runoff election earlier this year, wrote that this bold legislation was exactly what Georgians had in mind when they sent me to the Senate. Many social media users are applauding Stacey Abrams, who is widely credited with helping turn the state blue.
Republican voters are much more skeptical of trade deals, even though the party's establishment is still generally supportive.
GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Jonathan Cohn. His new book, The Ten Year War, is about the politics behind the passage of Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, and the subsequent attempts to dismantle or repeal it.
The sticking points between the $10,000 and $50,000 proposals revolve around which borrowers would benefit most, and the legality of forgiving student debt through legislation versus through executive action.
GONYEA: And she's referring there to Mark Zandi, John McCain's campaign economists. Donald Trump has criticized Zandi as biased because he has also advised the Obama administration.
We Answer The Question: What Is Medicare For All?
The timing of a final vote is unclear and will depend on the amendment process. If the legislation passes, the House will need to revote on the final version of the bill before it can be signed into law.
The White House originally said Trump would urge the IRS to use maximum enforcement discretion regarding the Johnson Amendment, which was passed in 1954 and prohibits 501(c)(3) nonprofits from endorsing specific political candidates. But the order itself, while calling on all agencies to protect religious liberty, instructs the Department of Treasury to enforce the law exactly as it is written.
SAGAL: He tried to sell meetings with the candidate for $2,400.
SIMON: Well, it's an interesting balance. It's a balance question, actually, what you're asking. And, you know, I think that people who like Trump want Trump to remain Trump to some degree. Maybe he has to compromise some of the time and be Trump some of the time. And it's a - it's a - it's a hard thing.
He had a laptop. He had a bicycle, she says. And he used our storage bins.

If the Justice Department can just throw in the towel whenever a law is challenged in court, it can effectively pick and choose which laws should remain on the books, wrote Bagley. That's as flagrant a violation of the President's constitutional duty to take care that the laws are faithfully executed as you can imagine.
Census Bureau spokesperson Michael Cook and Justice Department spokesperson Kelly Laco both declined to comment on the Maryland plaintiffs' latest court filing.
The department said it has asked private collection agencies to stop debt collection activities, including phone calls and mailers. In a release, the agency said it would rely on employers to ensure wages are not garnished, and it advised borrowers to contact their employers' human resources department if there are problems.
BURGESS: It was a tiny margin. And I will say that a lot of people did flip because as I was working with organized labor, we were out on these doorsteps. We were talking to people. They were upset with the negativity of the ads that were being shown on TV, and that was a problem for them, I think. I know there's going to be a recount. I don't think there's going to - there was no irregularities or anything like that. I mean, it was a close race. But one thing that happened is Rick Saccone could not hit the numbers that Donald Trump hit in any of these three counties. And that's why he came up a little short.
Now, when it comes to creating jobs, I would argue it's not even close. Even conservative experts say Trump's agenda will pull our economy back into recession. And according to an independent analysis by a former economic adviser to Senator John McCain,
DAVIS: It's hard to predict how that investigation will go. And this is why. The ethics committee in Congress does not generally investigate allegations to things related to something a lawmaker did before they served in Congress. It's about conduct when you're serving as a lawmaker.
The dispute erupted last year when Great River Energy, a rural electric cooperative based in Minnesota, announced that it planned to sell its Coal Creek Station, north of Bismarck, ND. If no buyer showed up, the company said it would shut the plant down in 2022. A coal mine that supplies the plant with fuel also would have to close. Roughly a thousand jobs would disappear.

A normal presidential candidate, he said, doesn't ask you to believe him. Instead, he tells you how he plans to get things done.
Some opposed the new payroll taxes, while others were concerned about the state's potential costs if payroll taxes don't collect enough. Critics have argued that paid leave mandates offer employers little flexibility to meet an employee's specific needs — and can create an economic burden for businesses.
Mike DeBonis, of The Washington Post, thanks a lot for your reporting. We appreciate it.
GREENE: All right, this morning, we're talking about movement on overhauling the tax code. House Republicans seem to be taking a victory lap.
Behind bars in the Alexandria, Va., detention center, Manafort's dark hair has sprouted patches of gray. During his Virginia trial, he sometimes refused to wear socks because he didn't like the look of the white jail-issued socks with his dark footwear.
Trump also made a reference to a report in the Washington Post that he had a contentious phone call with the prime minister of Australia, one of the nation's closest allies.
BIDEN: And at this moment when there's so much fear in the country and there's so much fear across the world, we need American leadership. We need presidential leadership that's honest, trusted, truthful and steady.
Support for older Americans: $1.4 billion in funding for programs authorized under the Older Americans Act, including support for nutrition programs, community-based support programs and the National Family Caregiver Support Program.
This afternoon, in the White House briefing room, a reporter asked President Trump the question that's on the minds of most Americans - when will life go back to normal? This is how the president answered.
It's a fear issue. When it comes to your own feelings of safety, suddenly it influences the way you view the entire issue.
Those already enrolled in a marketplace plan whose income changes should go back into the marketplace and update their income information as soon as possible. They may be eligible for larger premium subsidies for their marketplace plan or, if their income has dropped significantly, newly eligible for Medicaid. (Likewise, if their income has increased and they don't adjust their marketplace income estimates, they could be on the hook for overpayments of their subsidies when they file their taxes.)
We know from states that this approach works for both employees and their bosses, Shabo says.
Weissbourd is troubled by what he sees as a growing trend of conspicuous compassion, where giving is the new black, and a ribbon pin, a rubber bracelet or a family foundation is the new must have accessory. It brings social cachet to you, or cash to your company. Weissbourd says so much of that kind of giving sends a really bad message — especially to kids.
On the growth of the jail population
Certainly we're going to look at congressional action, Gina McCarthy, Biden's domestic climate advisor, told NPR. But right now, we can use the strength of the federal budget and our procurement opportunities to send the right market signals on the kind of technologies and products that we think we need and we know we have available now that are cost-effective and that, again, grow jobs.
And we have to make college affordable for every American. Because no hardworking student should be stuck in the red. We've already reduced student loan payments to ten percent of a borrower's income. Now, we've actually got to cut the cost of college. Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and I'm going to keep fighting to get that started this year.
HORSLEY: They show that initial claims for unemployment jumped last week by 33%, which is ominous, as you say. But it's just a hint of what we're likely to see in the weeks ahead. Those numbers reflect last week, and that was really before the dramatic moves by the government to try to contain this pandemic - you know, closing bars and restaurants and so many other places where crowds might gather. So we're likely to see more claims going forward.
Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance Jr., Who Is Investigating Trump, Won't Seek Reelection
This legislation is just as deeply flawed and troubling as the House bill introduced last month, said Mark Szybist, Senior Attorney for Climate and Clean Energy at NRDC. It props up nuclear plants regardless of profitability – and despite creating some headroom for renewables, that space is as likely to be filled by nuclear plants in Ohio. This bill is nothing more than a Band-Aid fix for nuclear power at a time when Pennsylvanians desperately need and deserve a long-term plan for clean energy.
Americans and other rich nations produce the most carbon emissions per capita, he says. Yet people in the world's poorest nations are most likely to suffer severe climate impacts, and that seems unfair, he says.
MARTIN: Where's the money going to come from?
The National Restaurant Association, for instance, opposed the Affordable Care Act and other Democratic reform efforts that were less sweeping than the single-payer approach. Today, the trade group doesn't have a specific stance on Medicare for All, though a spokesperson points to concerns about the eventual tax burden its members could face.

So, for example, in the fight over increase the minimum wage, even though these state chambers are supposed to represent those businesses - this was a survey of their own members, and their target members - these state chamber executives were told here's how to fight back. Here's how to combat these popular measures to increase the minimum wage. And they were told, for example, in that area to pivot to the earned income tax credit to try to talk about something else rather than the minimum wage. And it was interesting to see.
The media became a player — an antagonist — on the trail, thanks to Trump and, he would say, thanks to the media's coverage too. That may well have affected what people were saying to pollsters. Many states performed outside the margin of error of the projections.
So every dollar they were going to spend, they had to find somewhere else. It had to be new taxes, or it had to come out of the pockets of the drug makers or the hospitals. The problem is, if you only spend - if you can't spend more than a trillion dollars over 10 years, you end up in a situation where you're spending less now to help people buy insurance. And so that's why today, especially when you get into the middle-class people who are buying insurance on their own, you have a lot of people who are looking at very high premiums, really big deductibles. And, yeah, they have insurance. Yes, this is better than not having insurance. But, boy, it's a lot of money. It's not very affordable. And - you know, and that is why - one of the big reasons we're still here 10 years later saying, what do we need to do to fix our health care system?
Parnas has pleaded not guilty to those charges, but he is under a lot of legal pressure. His lawyer has been waging this campaign on social media in which he tries to stress how much he says Parnas knows. His lawyer has said Parnas wants to tell lawmakers what he knows, but his lawyer has in the past raised the question of immunity for Parnas in exchange for telling his story. So that would be very tricky to pull off. But it's important to remember that Parnas does have his own motivations here.
About $90 million of the latest total will be paid into the Marcellus Legacy Fund, which supports shale-related projects such as highways and sewers statewide, while another $18 million will go to state agencies specified by Act 13.
Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton announced his Washington office would be closed. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who self-quarantined after he was exposed at a conference to someone who tested positive for the virus, also closed his Washington office.
GREENE: But what do you tell federal workers who are out of work right now going without pay if they feel like they're being held hostage for a political dance?
The administration wants $567 million to fund up to nine migrant quarantine facilities along the Southwest border, including repurposed soft-sided facilities originally used for the migrant surge in 2019. The money would also be used for medical support for migrants, as well as money for personal protective equipment for CBP staff.
GROSS: How did this whisper campaign work? Like, how do these kinds...
This divide, however, is not new. The Republican Party — the party of Lincoln, as Republicans like to say — used to be one dominated by the wealthy and the educated.
Another proposed class action lawsuit was filed the same day by former Bloomberg field staffers in Georgia, Utah and Washington. That complaint alleges that after Bloomberg lost the Democratic nomination, his campaign
But it's not all bad news for Mulvaney. Trump tweeted he would join the diplomatic ranks, becoming the U.S. special envoy for Northern Ireland.
SAGAL: No, so I'll give you - you're close. It's like well, no, they're not snorting coke. They're checking their email.
It also meant less money going to the campaign, which lagged behind the official fundraising of several other GOP campaigns, to the point that Diaz, the campaign manager, went unpaid since October.
OSNOS: Well, in some ways, this was a storyline that I think people who generally covered politics didn't initially embrace, you know, the idea that somehow the alt-right or the white nationalist world would be even talked about in a discussion of an incoming presidential. It was so ludicrous that we didn't even really do it. And then it just became very clear early on in the Trump campaign that they were a part of this phenomenon. The neo-Nazi website endorsed him for president 12 days after he announced. And later you follow it all the way through 20 months later. He was endorsed by the newspaper the KKK. Steve Bannon has been - who is now chief strategist in the White House - has been really the sort of principal thinker in terms of how do you take ideas that exist way out on the far right and get them in front of people's eyes that are more conventional readers?
CARANCI: Well, it's a strange enforcement of the law. You have to complete a form - a tax exemption form - that you send into division of taxation with the titles of the book that you want to have exempted. And they will review that book and determine whether or not it qualifies for the exemption. And the general rule here is that if it's a work of fiction in poetry, it will qualify for a tax exemption. If it is a work of nonfiction, then it will not.

It's not a question of just sending a letter, Pelosi said. You have to do it in a very careful way.
BALABAN: Then he adds in hydrogen peroxide...
DAVIS: Well, that - what he said publicly is directly what contradicts what the president told Republicans when he was on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. In a closed-door meeting, he told Republicans that he thought if they failed at this, that they would put their congressional majorities at risk next year in the midterm elections.

People who have money can't withdraw it. The world is collapsing on top of everyone, she says, referring to currency controls that limit Lebanese bank withdrawals. ATMs no longer dispense dollars and depositors must wait in long lines to withdraw small sums each week.
The provision to legalize small amounts ahead of 2024 did not end up in the final bill.
At the very least, we can slow it down and buy time, he said.
JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett has sometimes downplayed the impact of the shutdown on the economy. But yesterday he seemed to have a different take. He said the impact would be twice as much as previous estimates. Here he was in an interview on Fox Business Network.
We cannot go through the situation we did back in 2009 where the stimulus wasn't strong enough and we stayed in recession for years, Schumer said. Just because the numbers are not as bad as they were doesn't mean that we don't need a continued strong push to get us out of this ditch and go upward and forward.

Still, Cohen said the Trumps were very worried about the treasure trove of documents Pecker had accumulated over the years that predated even Cohen's time working for the president.
KEITH: Yes, with just Democrats and a parliamentary procedure known as budget reconciliation, which would allow them to evade the filibuster and pass the package, potentially with just a simple majority. And they are prepared to begin the first steps of that process this week - working on a budget. Democrats are still haunted by the early days of the Obama presidency, when he was trying to get a big economic rescue package and Republicans didn't sign on, but they took a long time trying to reach a bipartisan agreement. And Democrats don't want to get burned again.
High-quality health care for all Americans.
Modern-day Americans can't read Maniac in a vacuum; it's impossible not to think of more recent school massacres when considering the Bath School disaster. Schechter realizes this, and he offers an intelligent analysis of the bombing as it relates to the contemporary U.S.:
Culp grew up in a trailer home with her parents, but she says she didn't exactly feel poor. I mean I knew I didn't have the best clothes like everybody, but we always had Christmas, she says.
Heather Whaling says her 22-person public relations company, Geben Communication in Columbus, Ohio, probably qualifies for the new tax credit. But she doesn't think it's the right approach.
Yeah. So this note was written by Lev Parnas who was working with Rudy Giuliani to advance President Trump's personal political fortunes by using Ukraine. This was part of a trove of messages and other records that Parnas handed over to the House Intelligence Committee. Also included there, text messages illuminating more details about that pressure campaign against the ousted U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.

All told, 11 states and the District of Columbia run their own marketplaces. Under the ACA, the marketplaces were supposed to become self-sustaining businesses within a few years, supported by fees insurers pay to offer plans on the sites.
That same month, federal agents with the FBI and Internal Revenue Service raided Pugh's home and offices at City Hall in connection with their investigation into the fraudulent book scheme. Hours after the raids, Republican Gov. Larry Hogan called for Pugh's resignation.

There are a few more questions about Avenatti in legal circles.
The question asks, Is this person a citizen of the United States?
BALABAN: And voila. We try it out.
But we can do so much more. Last year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer. Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources they've had in over a decade. Tonight, I'm announcing a new national effort to get it done. And because he's gone to the mat for all of us, on so many issues over the past forty years, I'm putting Joe in charge of Mission Control. For the loved ones we've all lost, for the family we can still save, let's make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.
In addition, the department is seeking $40 million to cover the anticipated increase in loan servicing costs due to student loan repayment relief changes, including the reduction of interest to 0% on all Federally-held student loans effective March 13, and provide funding to support communications and outreach efforts to education borrowers on their options and choices during

The plan would also make the tax code less progressive. While it would increase incomes across the income spectrum, it would increase them by much more for the richest Americans. The bottom four quintiles of income groups would see their incomes go up by 0.8 to 1.9 percent.
CHANG: Well, what is the risk to American businesses - particularly, American workers - if the White House doesn't impose new tariffs?
These organizations definitely don't have a democratic mandate because they have never been voted for, nobody elected them, and definitely the only force is the money behind them, Kovács said. And there are going to be sanctions against them if they don't behave according to the law.
DAVIES: You know, what's interesting about this issue is that you have local communities enacting ordinances to, you know, to regulate something like minimum wages or sick time or the use of plastic bags and then - state legislatures intervening to circumvent those restrictions.
This is not one of those places where you stand on principle, where you say, 'Oh! If it's not from the heart only, don't do it!'  says Kevin McCall, president and CEO of Paradigm Properties, a real estate development company in Boston that is involved in philanthropy and community service. My attitude is, if the net benefit to society is positive, go for it!
A high-profile climate bill would test the Democrats' razor-thin margin in the Senate, where support from party conservatives like Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia would be hard won. Instead, Democrats may look to add climate policies to other bills or pass them through the arcane budget process.
ROMER: Larry's extreme aversion to paying his taxes led him to take some extreme actions. He filed papers declaring himself a sovereign citizen of the state of California. According to his lawyer, Jim, by opting out of U.S. citizenship, Larry could opt of the federal income tax. And if that wasn't enough to satisfy the IRS, Larry formed something called a pure trust. He routed pretty much all of his income into the trust. Now, went the idea, it wasn't his personal income anymore. It was the trust's income.
That's because it backfired. The sort of nimbleness is lost when you're doing the division of labor, Franz said in an interview. Even though there's a lot of money coming into the superPAC and it's unconstrained, that doesn't necessarily mean the messaging is going to be effective.
WESSEL: No. I don't think there is a consensus. I think there's widespread acknowledgement that the distribution of income and wealth in America is unequal. What you often hear from people on the right is they want to focus on equality of opportunity rather than equality of outcomes. So they are interested in what can we do to give poor people a chance to build a business, go to school, make it into the middle class, and they worry less than the people on the left do about these data that we've been discussing that suggests that the inequality of outcomes has grown.
He wants to get rid of the federal minimum wage.
And people like Rucker are not easy to replace. The most experienced NIFA and ERS staffers are researchers working at the very top of their fields, often leading the national discussions on huge topics, such as how to feed the world in the midst of climate change.
Jennifer Lentfer, a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades, says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development. There are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject. In the coming weeks, Lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question Western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative. And in January, graduate students at Duke University are organizing a conference called Decolonizing Global Health 2020.
But one last dose of caution: It's going to be a tough sell in our conference, there is no question about it.
You know, the wall is built. We're doing record numbers at the wall. Now, they want to take down the wall. Let's let everyone flow in. Let's let everybody flow in. We did a great job in the wall. Remember, the wall, they said it could never be done. One of the largest infrastructure projects we've ever had in this country, and it's had a tremendous impact, that we got rid of catch and release. We got rid of all of this stuff that we had to live with.

Trump Administration Vows 'Biggest Tax Cut,' 'Largest' Overhaul In History
I've interrogated my feelings on this to make sure that this is not judgment, to make sure this is not me being disdainful, she says. It's a fear issue. When it comes to your own feelings of safety, suddenly it influences the way you view the entire issue.
NPR journalists may not serve on government boards or commissions. Generally, we avoid serving on boards, and we don't hold offices that would create conflicts of interest between our work for NPR and our responsibilities to the other institution. We have sometimes made exceptions to allow journalists to serve on the boards of institutions where such conflicts are unlikely, such as other journalism organizations or educational institutions. All such exceptions require approval from supervisors. And of course, if an NPR journalist serves on the board of an institution that becomes the subject of NPR's reporting, that journalist should be recused from any related coverage.
They are probably, practically speaking, talking about leaving the ACA, as is, in place, Hoadley says. Then he can change the ACA to have it showcase the kinds of plans he wants to see in place.
I think a day-one priority for Vilsack could just be to simply remove the restriction on hiring to be in Kansas City and allow hiring to be in Kansas City or D.C. That would allow us to quickly get back some of our former staffers, Dodson says.
The result was something Meade said his group could work with and expand upon. Make no mistake about it — that this will be rolled out in every judicial circuit in the state of Florida, because at the end of the day, it is the law, said Meade.

If dental care is needed, the prisoner must pay, he said. If the prisoner has no money, he or she still receives treatment, but goes into debt. Legal copies are made and legal mail is sent. And the prisoner goes further into debt.
And the only unhappy person in the United States, single most unhappy, is Hillary Clinton. Because she said: Why didn't you do this for me four years ago? Why didn't you do this for me four years ago? Change the votes, 10,000 in Michigan. You could have changed the whole thing. But she's not too happy. You know, you don't see her anymore. What happened? Where's Hillary? Where is she?

It's a big back-to-school shopping week, and Texas stores are having their annual tax-free weekend. And usually, retailers in El Paso get a lot of business from people just over the border in Mexico. But after the recent mass shooting at an El Paso Walmart, fewer shoppers want to make the trip. From El Paso, Houston Public Media's Andrew Schneider reports.
That overall feeling — frustration, but no clear effort to derail what will be one of the largest spending bills in U.S. history — is why the White House is so confident the rescue plan will pass the evenly-divided Senate this week and that House will approve the final amended version, too, sending it to Biden's desk by the end of next week.
The paper, which lays out a simple blueprint for making insurance more affordable for more people while working within the current health law's structure, comes just days before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee begins hearings on ways to stabilize markets in the short term.
INSKEEP: We met Ocasio-Cortez inside that office. Sunlight fell through the oversized window onto her fuchsia suit. Her office is still a fraction of the size of the committee chairmen who hold real power in Congress, though she has something they do not. The 29-year-old is a media star. She has been since she upset a leading Democrat in a New York City primary last year. Her surprise victory cast her as a party insurgent. Her label as a Democratic Socialist also alarmed conservatives, who now see her face constantly on Fox News.
HASSETT: Yeah, of course. And I've known - or knew Alan since graduate school. You know, my heart goes out to his family. It's just a tremendous loss for the profession. He was such a great guy, a brilliant economist, a model for all of us. When I was chosen to be the CEA chair for President Trump, he gave me a call and had all sorts of really useful tips and stayed in touch after I got here. You know, he's the kind of person that didn't seek the limelight, but the limelight sought him because of his immense talent.
INSKEEP: Robert Costa of The Washington Post is in our studios. Robert, thanks for coming by.
Their main experiment was pretty simple: they randomly gave a group of workers a large portion of their compensation earlier in their work period rather than at the very end. On average, they were given 1,400 rupees, or about 20 dollars. This was equivalent to about what they had earned in the previous month, and a large fraction of them used the money to pay off outstanding debts.
Ryan's pitch comes at a time when many key trade groups are voicing major concerns about the repeal. The American Medical Association sent a letter to lawmakers bemoaning an expected decline in health insurance coverage and the potential harm it would cause to vulnerable patient populations.
The family coverage contribution reduction of $50 — from $6,900 to $6,850 – isn't much of a change. It happened because the federal government altered the way it calculates inflation adjustments to the contribution limits.
He also wants to expand the child tax credit, has a plan to offset some costs of child care and would cancel $10,000 in student loans right away because of the pandemic, plus more for a commitment to community service. And he wants to invest $1.3 trillion in infrastructure over the next 10 years.
KELLY: And just to clarify, Scott, they are also saying, this is not going to go to absolutely everyone; billionaires aren't going to be getting these checks - is that right?
Infrastructure is by far the easiest, the president said Dec. 22 during the bill signing for the tax overhaul. People want it — Republicans and Democrats. We're going to have tremendous Democrat support on infrastructure as you know. I could've started with infrastructure — I actually wanted to save the easy one for the one down the road. So we'll be having that done pretty quickly.

But Kallman and Ferorelli say the focus on numbers fails to capture the emotion that drives many to work on the issue in the first place. For activists of childbearing age, Ferorelli says, climate change isn't just an intellectual problem but a heart problem.
But they all come from the same voting base, right? I mean, the legislatures, some of them are representing these very communities that enact these ordinances. Why is there such a disconnect between the politicians at the local level who are enacting some of these ordinances and those at the state level who are cracking down on them?
The key word is average. Some middle-class families will indeed see a tax cut. Others in the very same income brackets will not. Why the difference? It's because of how the House went about that goal of making the tax code much simpler.

A community organizing group and others challenging the question in Maryland argue that communication shows that at least one key Census Bureau official had long been aware of Hofeller's interest in a citizenship question, which the plaintiffs say drove the administration's efforts to include the question on forms for the 2020 census.
LIASSON: Oh, my goodness. The reaction has been widespread, mostly negative. Up until now, there's been this view that Trump's bark is worse than his bite. He doesn't always do what he says. There hasn't been a war with North Korea yet. He hasn't ended NAFTA. But with the exception of the steel and aluminum manufacturers in America, corporate America has reacted very negatively. The Wall Street Journal editorial page called it his greatest policy blunder. Conservatives, who've been pleased with how in line he's been with their wishes on almost everything else, are horrified now. Although, they shouldn't be because, as I said, he's been talking about this for 30 years. So now Republicans are hoping he can be talked out of it. Here's Republican Senator from South Dakota John Thune.

Obviously, if you've got emergency funds, tap that. Cut any unnecessary expenses. If you've got things that you're automatically paying that are not essential, pause those. And then the next level is looking at pots of money that you wouldn't normally tap, like your retirement account or you want to pause if you're making contributions to your kid's college fund. Look for two things that are not necessities right now.

Trump then challenged the subpoena anew, arguing that it was overly broad and politically motivated. Vance is a Democrat. A district court ruled against Trump, as did a unanimous three-judge panel on a federal appeals court in New York.
BEYER: Yeah, thank you. He's a - the impeachment inquiry - and the notion is that the inquiry will give us tools - investigative tools, subpoena tools - that we don't have in the regular committees. The committees are largely limited to things that affect our legislative function, whereas an impeachment inquiry actually says, did the president actually obstruct justice? You know, Mueller cited 10 instances where the president probably did - may have obstructed justice. And, of course, he decided not to indict because he felt the Justice Department told him he couldn't. But he left it to us to make that investigation and make that determination.

The removal of the presidential term limit was not part of his package of proposed constitutional amendments; instead, the changes featured in the package would actually diminish the president's power and ability to sidestep the limits as Putin did.

We're hopeful that recalibration of the federal excise tax for small brewers would allow them more working capital to reinvest in their businesses and hopefully grow a little bit faster, he said.
But unfortunately, there are too many who take the opposite view and their behavior contributes to stagnant wages and lower economic growth. That's why, as president, I will work to reward companies that share profits with their employees, on top of paying a good wage. Because if they can do it for their executives, they sure can do it for their workers.
Journalists also pointed to the nature of the event — in person and indoors — as a possible health risk, even with limited seating. It is not the first time such questions have been raised. Pompeo held large indoor holiday parties last month despite warnings from public health officials. The Voice of America scrupulously adheres to all CDC COVID-19 guidelines, a VOA spokeswoman said in a statement.
And then you have some cities and those city representatives who are outnumbered by those rural representatives. And so what you're seeing in some instances, although not all because you certainly have conservatives representing suburbs, for example, but what you're seeing in some ways is a very blue city, red state divide. And in Alabama, you have a situation which had another dimension to it, which is you have a city of Birmingham, a city that is now, after many years and a very long civil rights struggle, now led by African-American leaders in that city.

KIM: Well, the opposition in Russia is very diffuse, and these protests represent more than just support for Navalny, as we heard from that young man, but really dissatisfaction with the Kremlin and with the state of the economy across the country. Navalny's team is in charge of these particular protests. And that's one reason why the Kremlin has brought new charges against Navalny's aides who remain in Russia. So Navalny still has people outside of Russia, and they're trying to keep up this momentum. Tomorrow, Navalny has a court date. Prosecutors want to give him 3 1/2 years in jail for an alleged parole violation in an old case that Navalny calls politically motivated. Navalny's team are now calling on people to show up at the court tomorrow morning.

It wasn't young: In 1971, the New York Times wondered how 18-to-20-year-olds, with their fresh right to vote, might upset the political establishment in the 1972 election. And in 1978, Broder wrote about how a youth movement into the Senate might upset the establishment.
BROWN: Well, first, Steve, it's - the dignity of work is more than a phrase. For me, it's who I am. And it's a career of fighting for workers. It's a lot of things. It's minimum wage. It's the overtime rule which the president undercut. I mean, the White House looks like a retreat for Wall Street executives. They always come down on the side of special interests. I want somebody in the White House, whoever is the nominee, talking about the dignity of work, putting workers first.
There is a cloud of suspicion that hangs over the president as well, with mounting questions about his business ties that are only compounded by his continued refusal to release his tax returns. More than 6 in 10 Americans say they believe Trump has either done something illegal (33 percent) or unethical but not illegal (28 percent). Just 31 percent say they believe he has done nothing wrong.

If they get away with it, that means less money going into the treasury, less money for programs that would help deal with the fallout for the opioid crisis, said Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-CA).
And this is not a time for half measures. To build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, we have to go big and bold. So ...

SAGAL: You're going to go for the guy who has the number 34 shaved into his back to honor sweetness, Walter Payton?
SIEGEL: In the early 1990s, there were bestsellers about how the Japanese were cleaning our clocks. Some of those books were admiring, many were critical and claimed they were doing it unfairly. But there was a common assumption that Japan was on the rise. In a nutshell, what happened to that Japan of, say, the 1980s?
There had been some discussion about holding up the House measure to wait until the broader economic stimulus plan was crafted, but McConnell said that won't be the case. He suggested that despite some unease among members of his party to approve the measure, it should be approved.
I want to nominate a Democrat, whoever he or she is, I want to nominate a Democrat who's going to fight for the dignity of work and is going to put workers of all races first because justice issues grows out of that in a way that we need to make sure that workers have opportunities.
I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselves.
Trump has been criticized for his own rhetoric on minorities, most notably referring to Mexican immigrants as rapists in his June 2015 announcement speech and calling for a ban on Muslims entering the United States.
KAHN: Well, the White House says there was one. Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales publicly never said there was one, but it wasn't Morales who backed out of a deal if there was one. He was headed to the U.S. last week to meet with President Trump. But opponents in Guatemala sued in their courts to stop Morales from signing off on such a deal. They did win an injunction from the Guatemalan high court on the grounds that the president can't unilaterally sign international accords. He must have approval from Congress. And that made any supposed deal moot anyway.
Twenty Republican state attorneys general filed suit on Feb. 26, charging that Congress' changes to the law in last year's tax bill rendered the entire ACA unconstitutional. In the tax law, Congress repealed the penalty for people who fail to have health insurance starting in 2019.
Quoting a letter from the late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA) to President Obama, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, Passing health care is the great unfinished business of our country. She added, That is, until today.
GINGRICH: Yes. It led to an agreement with Clinton that led to welfare reform, the largest capital gains tax cut in history and four straight balanced budgets for the only time in your lifetime. And we wouldn't have gotten to them without the level of intensity. I mean, I think that we couldn't have moved the system that far without having raised the heat.

These aren't the first would-be parents to ask whether it's fair to bring a child into the world. U.S. birth rates plummeted during the Great Depression. Many also must have thought twice amid warnings of overpopulation in the 1960s and '70s, and under the threat of nuclear holocaust.
Tracing what type of coverage is purchased off the exchange is difficult because there is no centralized source. Consumers can buy plans directly from insurers, or they may use a broker or an online web portal. According to one such portal , eHealth, 28 percent of unsubsidized consumers on its site bought silver plans in 2018, while 42 percent bought bronze plans, whose coverage is less generous than silver plans and typically have lower premiums. Conversely, on the exchanges nearly two-thirds of people bought silver plans in 2018 while 29 percent bought bronze plans, according to federal data.
One potential tax Sanders listed that has been particularly controversial is a 4% income-based premium that households making more than $29,000 per year would pay. He also calls for taxes on employers and greater taxes on high-income households.
GILES: And in Arizona, some see this never-ending discussion as a means to an end. You know, we talked about how Senate Republicans - House Republicans, too - are pushing all these bills. And Senate Republicans in particular have spent almost three months now pushing to audit the election in the state's largest county. Maricopa County supervisors have passionately defended the election results and resisted a subpoena to hand over ballots so that the Senate can conduct some kind of audit. And Democratic Supervisor Steve Gallardo said the senators - what they don't want is election integrity. He says they just want to drum up doubts about the election to provide cover to pass these kinds of bills.

For instance, at a rally in Scranton, Pa., Trump promised to massively cut taxes for the middle class, the forgotten people, the forgotten men and women of this country, who built our country. During a town hall meeting on NBC's Today show, he said he believes in raising taxes on the wealthy.
The timing of the introduction and passage of these laws – in September, at the height of India's coronavirus crisis — has also fallen under suspicion. Supporters say that when COVID lockdowns forced some wholesale markets to shut, farmers needed reform even more urgently to allow transactions to happen outside those shuttered markets. It was around that time that India's economy shrank 24%. Millions were falling back into poverty.
Florida Sen. Marco Rubio voiced similar worries to the New York Times. Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell want the bill on President Trump's desk by the end of April. I think if that's the approach they take, they won't have the votes in the Senate, Rubio warned.
To put it in one word it's been devastating, he says. When you lose 300 jobs here, 500 jobs there, the result of that is you have 3 or 500 'For Sale' signs up. This is real money being taken out of the local economy.
SHAPIRO: Now, let's talk about how you won Michigan, largely in thanks to white voters, which has also been true in other states where you've done well. And I wonder about your effort to close the gap with Secretary Clinton among African-American voters, particularly in light of your remarks on Sunday night - when you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto, which many black leaders criticized.
Warren's Presidential Campaign Hopes For Boost From N.H. Primary
Representative Chip Roy, R-Texas, is inviting Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council. Trump thanked Judd on Twitter in January for speaking in support of building a wall along the Southern border.
McGrew claims that what happened to Brady wouldn't have happened if law enforcement had been using Palantir's system because of its privacy control. When some of these officials were looking at Tom Brady's data, they would be leaving a trail. It is all captured in a log that you don't need to be a technical guy to understand, he says. A compliance officer or a civil liberties group would be able to see exactly who was looking at what information.
GRAVES: In Arizona, in the city of Tempe, which is where one of the major universities in Arizona is, there was a study committee in which the city council and others were working with the local businesses to look into how to have a paid sick leave measure in that city.
[The Children's Health Insurance Program insures more than 8 million children annually and costs more than $13 billion. Insuring 3 million more kids represents an increase of about 37 percent. When you factor that increase into the cost, you'll see an increase slightly under $5 billion — which is probably what makes the word nearly important in this claim. - Meg Anderson]
Between 2001 and 2008, she collected more than $3 million from clients applying for an adjustment of their immigration status. The adjustment program, however, had ended in 2001, so the clients she applied for were not actually eligible.

Bernie Sanders and the other senators running for president are trapped in the president's impeachment trial. But later today, they will zip out back onto the campaign trail using every precious hour to try to make their final pitch to voters. For Mr. Sanders, that's often at sizable rallies, a hallmark of his campaign. NPR's Don Gonyea takes us to New Hampshire to see how the Vermont senator has been rallying his loyal base.
One thing that we've seen is that the Mueller team only speaks through court filings and through court presentations — trial or oral arguments, Sandick said. And so, they clearly want to communicate some of the evidence that they have into the public.

N. SHAHIN: So, at the time, I was about a junior in high school when I'm starting to look at colleges and figure out what career path I want to take. At the time, I was enrolled in some computer science courses in my high school, and the teacher was phenomenal. And I could see that as being something I could potentially be doing, as well.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development projects the U.S. economy will grow by 6.5% this year. That's more than twice the growth rate it was projecting in December — thanks in large part to more robust federal aid.
It used to seem like the best defense against sexist rhetoric was to pretend as if these effects didn't exist at all, Hill says. But sticking your head in the sand is no way to advocate for a better future for women.
AHLUWALIA: I think it's being very energetic, of course controversial at times. President Trump has tried to do - and attack many things, not only making our country safe, fighting and defeating ISIS, finding issues with countries who are not great allies to us - that's Pakistan, to say - at the same time, giving the consumer confidence. Our stock market is doing excellently well. Consumer confidence, again, up. So he's done a phenomenal job, I would say.
Here, analyst David Wessel acknowledges the problem, but questions the solution.
But in the week that followed, schools closed; restaurants, bars, and places such as Disney World shut down; and the president declared a national emergency. On March 16, Republican Sen. Mitt Romney got behind Furman's idea — even the specific number: $1,000 for every American adult. And soon President Trump, who had previously put his weight behind a payroll tax cut, said he was now behind the idea of sending checks to everyone as a way to provide relief more quickly. For Furman, this was a victory. A payroll tax cut clearly doesn't work in an economy where lots and lots of people aren't being paid, he says.
As far as women are concerned, Trump got 41 percent of their vote. That's not remarkable for a Republican candidate; exit polls showed Romney with 44 percent of women's votes in 2012, and 41 percent is also right in the ballpark of how women have voted for Republican presidential candidates since 1992.
We need to highlight the abuse, Johnson said in a tweet. This is not a COVID relief bill. It's a boondoggle for Democrats.
The exceptions include this: In 2008, Trump Properties LLC sold an estate in Florida, that it had acquired in 2005 for approximately $41 million, to a Russian billionaire for $95 million.
This is not a time one wants to disrupt the employer marketplace, Klein said in an interview. It seems perplexing to think that if the ACA is going to be repealed, either in large part or altogether, it would be succeeded by a proposal imposing a tax on people who get health coverage from their employer.
MARTIN: Yeah, OK, NPR's Greg Allen has gotten a firsthand look at a hospital in San Juan. He's on the line now.
House Speaker Paul Ryan also faced protesters this week when visiting a charter school in Harlem for National Teacher Appreciation Day. The school is part of a charter network, Success Academy, in New York City known for its high test scores and high-profile leader, Eva Moskowitz. She was once rumored to be under consideration for President Trump's education secretary. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, also met briefly with a special education class in a public school that shares the building, Newsday reported.
Yes, people in federal marketplace states can take that step, health experts say. Under COBRA, people can be required to pay the full amount of the premium plus a 2% administrative fee. Marketplace coverage is almost certainly cheaper.
The Times also reported that Trump is again perpetuating the well-refuted conspiracy theory that his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, was not born in the U.S.
In addition to weaker exports, the Commerce Department cited a number of other factors for the slowdown, including drops in business investment and investments in commercial and residential real estate. But consumer spending jumped 4.3% in the second quarter and government spending surged 5%.
The Democrats are hopeless — they never vote for anything. Not even one vote. But we're going to try and give our Republicans, the weak ones because the strong ones don't need any of our help. We're going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.
The Union of European Football Associations is postponing its biggest tournament, Euro 2020, for 12 months because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The competition, which pits national teams against one another, was to have been played in June and July.
The White House is banging the drums that President Trump is doing something big again ahead of his 100th day in office — unveiling a tax plan.
Trump Vows To 'Destroy' Provision On Tax-Exempt Organizations
Democratic Reps. Ben Ray Luján and Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, as well as Democratic Reps. Raul Ruiz and Pete Aguilar of California will be the recipients of this political ad push, as will Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. Luján is the chairman of House Democrats' campaign committee.
Employer health plans cover some 150 million people, while last year individual plans covered about 20 million, according to Mark Farrah Associates, a data firm. That included some 10 million who bought coverage through the health law's subsidized exchanges.
After the violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 by a mob of pro-Trump supporters, the entire Capitol complex, a place that is generally open to the public, has been locked down.
Dmitry has always been dealing with these issues, Putin explained. From the standpoint of enhancing our defense capability and security, I believe that it is possible and asked him to handle issues of this kind in the future.
Such prison behavior helped pave the way for his commutation, said Aaron Goldstein, one of Blagojevich's lawyers during the corruption trials.
Tax Increases Projected Under Trump Plan Lily Batchelder, a law professor at NYU and visiting fellow at the Tax Policy Center, says Donald Trump's plan would boost taxes for many families, with some of the largest increases applying to single-parent families because of the repeal of the head of household filing status and personal exemptions. A single parent with $75,000 in earnings, two school-age children and no child care costs would face a tax increase of around $2,440.
Let's also expand incentives like the New Market Tax Credits that can bring businesses, government, and communities together to create good jobs in places that have been left out and left behind.
Immigration, Infrastructure And Iran: The President's Plans For 2018
SIEGEL: But there's a difference arguing about how many divisions should be there...
Many wealthy countries around the world have a child allowance where the government provides regular income support to parents throughout the year, she said. So in many ways, this is the U.S. catching up to the rest of the world and recognizing the importance of investing in children.
KAREN BASS: They used to refer to him as a dog whistle, but I think most people now recognize it's a bullhorn. I think this last year has been absolutely positively horrific. We have seen a level of racism become normalized, something that we haven't seen for decades. And anytime you have the president of the United States making statements like he did a week ago about the entire continent of Africa, it's - he's consistent. How he views people of color around the world is the same as he views people of color in the United States. When he's talking about making America great again, many of us hear that as making America white again.
SAGAL: Well, think about it. As you may know - and perhaps you have one or know somebody who does - the Apple Watch is a watch that goes on your wrist.
Democrats have been able to break through in the state's gubernatorial and Senate races (though Sen. Jon Tester is a top target in 2018) but they haven't held the state's only House seat in almost two decades.
Trump absolutely, through executive action, could have tremendous interference to the point of literally stopping a train on its tracks, said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of law and health policy at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.
With my husband and I now, we haven't been able to do Christmas in 10 years. We don't even have a tree, she says.
CORNISH: All gets back to football.
In that same post, Zuckerberg also pointed out studies showing that increasingly, more young people are getting their news primarily from sites like Facebook, and that young people have also said it helps them see a larger and more diverse set of opinions. And Zuckerberg said the company is trying to do a better job of sifting out fake news.
And, you know, you saw the president take Putin's line on Venezuela. After the phone call, he said Russia has - is not looking to get involved in Venezuela. That directly contradicts his own secretary of state and national security adviser, who've said Russia not only is involved in Venezuela. It's working in defiance of the U.S. government. And Secretary Pompeo said the Russians have invaded Venezuela.

But former official Kathryn Evans says the whole move was based on politics, not objective analysis. She's excited about legislation designed to keep this kind of thing from happening again. It's called the Cost of Relocations Act, and Evans says it's a direct response to the forced move of the two USDA research agencies across the county.
Saying that you're never going to raise taxes on people with income below $250,000 is leadership, but it's leadership in the wrong direction, says Bill Gale, co-director of the Tax Policy Center at the Brookings Institution. It's telling people what they want to hear, rather than what they need to hear.
To be clear, these aren't people running away from the U.S.; lots of them already live overseas but are only now choosing not to be U.S. citizens.

OK, let's pretend you have the money. If you had $2 billion today, what would you do with it?
We're proposing a massive change in the way we do unemployment benefits. You'd get the money quickly. You'd get almost your total salary, if not your total salary. And it would go for months and months and months, so you wouldn't have to worry, is the government going to send me a check next month or the month after? So it's far...
As he points out, women are a common thread in many of these movements. The partisan gap by gender — blue for women, red for men — is as wide as it's ever been. A record number of women are running for office this fall. And teaching is among the most female-dominated professions.
National Republican groups have poured about $4 million into the race to knock down Ossoff, looking to tie him to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. — still toxic with the GOP base and a motivating factor to turn out their voters, Republicans say — at and to argue he's tried to embellish his national security credentials.
But Trump, unlike every other viable presidential candidate in the television era, doesn't depend on TV ads. The Wesleyan Media Project found that by mid-February, his overall TV spending totaled only about $6.6 million. The campaign depends mainly on big rallies and free coverage by cable news networks.
DEMBOSKY: At this one outside the Capitol, about 60 protesters in yellow T-shirts bowed their heads in prayer.
Negotiators were also leaning toward allowing homeowners to write off interest on mortgages valued at $750,000 or less, according to several GOP aides. That is an increase from the $500,000 limit in the House bill — and lower than current law, which allows interest write-offs on mortgages up to $1 million.
The reason why Republicans were able to comment on the ACA — and of course many of them commented negatively — was because the bill was out there, Pallone said.
Danny Diaz did the best he could do in a very tough environment, Matt Rhoades, who ran Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign, told NPR. While Jeb Bush did not win the nomination, Diaz stayed loyal to his principal to the end, and that speaks volumes of his character.

Several Democratic presidential hopefuls made stops in Atlanta this weekend at the Young Leaders Conference. They spoke with African American church leaders and to thousands of black millennials about health care, gun violence and their proposals for criminal justice reform. One of those hopefuls is with us this morning. Senator Bernie Sanders is here to share, for the first time, his plan to overhaul the criminal justice system. Good morning, Senator Sanders.
Democrats said the measure didn't go far enough for worker protections and too far for aid to major industries, and had insufficient oversight for the assistance fund based at the Treasury Department for impacted industries.
Some estimate that as many as 10% of COVID-19 survivors will have persistent symptoms, while others think it's lower. Dr. Zeina Chemali, who runs a clinic for long-haulers at Massachusetts General Hospital, says early studies from Europe suggest it may be between 3% and 5%.
As negotiations continued throughout the day on Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced the Senate would cancel its planned week-long recess next week so it could work on the legislation.
Also on the phone with us is Lenny McAllister. He's a syndicated political commentator and author of the book Diary of a Mad Black Proud Young Conservative.

While legislation in Congress hasn't gotten very far, measures on the state level have drawn national attention, including an Alabama bill signed in May that bans nearly all abortions. It's considered to be the most restrictive abortion law in the country. Other states, like Georgia and Mississippi, have passed laws that prohibit abortion once heartbeat activity can be detected. — Debbie Elliott, national correspondent covering the South
Democrats are celebrating an apparent victory by Conor Lamb in last week's special election in Pennsylvania. It was a tight race against Republican Rick Saccone in a district Trump won by almost 20 points. In the end, Lamb appears to have won by just a few hundred votes. Last month, I visited the district, and I met two voters - Dave Podurgiel, a Republican who works in the tugboat industry, and Jojo Burgess, a steelworker and union leader. And I wanted to hear their reaction to the results, so we're bringing them on now. Hello, gentlemen.
EISBRENNER: You know, the investigation really starts out with Flynn because he could have been compromised as national security adviser, yes. Look - they've got to definitely look into that. Now, feel free to look into the collusion part, too, but I doubt very much they're going to find anything that affected the election. So - but, hey, if they want to - if the FBI wants to investigate it, go right ahead, you know. I have no problem with that.
He has strongly opposed Trump's proposal to ban all Muslims from immigrating to the United States — Pence declared that the U.S. Constitution specifically protects people of all faiths. He grudgingly embraced Obamacare, taking the federal government's money for Medicaid expansion, but attaching more conservative strings to it. And unlike Trump, he supported the Iraq War.

Changes to Paycheck Protection Program: The bill includes $7.25 billion in new money for the PPP program and would allow more nonprofits to apply, including those groups that engage in advocacy and some limited lobbying. It also allows larger nonprofits to be eligible.
Again, we don't know if he's going to take these, but I don't think it's fair to say he's had, you know, three or four or five different plans. And even the other day when he said something to the effect, well, I may have to raise taxes on the rich, I think that was taken a little bit out of context.
In February, with Democrats freshly in control of the House of Representatives, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., urged patience in going after the tax returns.

That seemed to be the basic thrust. Pete Buttigieg, who has actually served in Afghanistan, wanted to make that point and also wanted to say that we shouldn't be looking at any of our troops and telling them that we're not going to stand with them and that we are not going to be committed to the things we send them into the field to die for.

He's got, I don't know, a dozen or so economic advisers he just named: Hedge fund guys, billionaire guys, six guys named Steve, apparently. And so they wrote him a speech and he delivered it in Detroit. Now, they tried to make his old tired ideas sound new. But here's what we all know, because we heard it again. His tax plans will give super big tax breaks to large corporations and the really wealthy, just like him and the guys who wrote the speech, right, said Clinton. He wants to basically just repackage trickle-down economics.
President Trump just declared a national emergency. It was the second presidential address about COVID-19 this week.

And my state, I believe, is a template for success for the United States in our climate policies, as well as all the other progressive things we have done. And we have shown that we have developed the best economy in the United States with the fastest GDP growth and the fastest wage growth not despite the fact that we're embracing clean energy but because we are embracing clean energy. But we're not done yet. There's more to do.
SANDERS: No. We went into South Carolina against a very popular candidate - the wife of a president - and we did poorly. I think if you check out what's going on right now, we're going to do much, much better. Criminal justice - I did not ignore it in 2016. And criminal justice is an issue that cannot be ignored. You cannot ignore a reality in which we have 2 million people, disproportionately African American, Latino and Native American, who are behind bars.
Honestly, I think we should probably retire the phrase 'cancel culture' at this point, because it's losing its meaning when people just use it to mean, 'I resent your drawing attention to my crazy ideas,'  she said.

Dock workers in California have seen a steep drop in cargo shipments from China. Ray Familathe (ph), who heads a longshoreman's union, says that means his members have 25% less work.

Sadly, this type of sophomoric, self-possessed intemperance is illustrative of the atmosphere Mr. Diaz created inside what was supposed to be a joyful campaign, Wareham said in an email. My views are anything but personal. Indeed, they are shared by dozens and dozens of loyal Jeb supporters who for many months held their tongues out of concern they might possibly harm Gov. Bush. Mr. Diaz always seemed to think the campaign was somehow about him. In the end, it largely was because the candidate who is, by far, the most qualified person to run this country in such hazardous times is no longer in the race, in large measure, because of Mr. Diaz's incompetence.

We need big, bold, immediate federal action to deal with the crisis.

Those include Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Hillsborough counties, which together include more than a third of the state's total population.

As Bush and his team laid plans for the 2016 Republican primaries, they set out to have the best-financed superPAC ever. And for a time, they did. Right to Rise USA, where Wareham's money was actually going, raised $118 million, and spent $87 million on advertising, even as Bush never came close to winning a primary. That's almost triple the campaign's budget.

DE SOUZA: No, I don't think in blaming somebody. I just think it like Fernando was expressing it. We have to address this issue because - I give one example. I'm an educator, you know. I coach soccer here, and I educate young Americans and people from other countries here, too. You know, every time I speak with them, I tell words like dream, work hard and you're going to succeed. If you do the right thing, you're going to get a reward in the end.
Now we're hearing rumors about trying to use trying to break the reconciliation rules to pass things like a $15 minimum wage and so forth, Cornyn said. But that would just destroy the Senate as an institution just as bad as eliminating the filibuster.
[That's about right, so long as not every veteran chooses to go to a public school outside their state. In the 2015-2016 school year, the cost of in-state tuition and fees for one year at 4-year public colleges - the GI Bill won't pay for private colleges - was just over $9,000. Multiply that by four years and you get $36,000. Multiply that by 47,000 and you get about $1.7 billion - well under Clinton's estimate. But out-of-state tuition was just under $24,000 per year. Do the same math and you'll end up at $4.5 billion, slightly over Clinton's estimate. - Meg Anderson]
By the way, you're talking about tens of thousands. If Georgia had merely rejected the same number of unlawful ballots as in other years, they should have been approximately 45,000 ballots rejected. Far more than what we needed to win, just over 11,000. They should find those votes. They should absolutely find that. Just over 11,000 votes, that's all we need. They defrauded us out of a win in Georgia, and we're not going to forget it.
MICHAEL DELL: So no, I'm not supportive of that. And I don't think it would help the growth of the U.S. economy.

The old NYMEX was a contact sport, he said. You might have someone who is an ex-policeman and then you might have someone who went to MIT or Harvard. And they're all trading on the same floor. Gary was very helpful in that.
Now, you mentioned Republicans. The sad fact is, at the moment, that we're going to have to find a way to get this done without them because right now, we still have not seen the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt. We're seeing the spirit of Mitch McConnell, who will kill any climate change bill in its cradle if he has a chance. And that means we have to get rid of the filibuster. We have to prevent Mitch McConnell from stopping climate change. We have to let majority vote - one person, one vote - be the Democratic rule in the U.S. Senate. I'm the first candidate to say that. I hope others will follow so that we can get progress in this.
And how many people here know other people, that when there are hundreds of thousands and then millions of ballots got sent out, got three, four, five, six, and I heard one, who got seven ballots. And then they say you didn't quite make it, sir.
And again, most people would stand there at 9 o'clock in the evening and say I want to thank you very much, and they go off to some other life. But I said something's wrong here, something is really wrong, can have happened.

These types of business innovations, he says, have the potential to lift entire countries out of poverty by providing employment as well as social benefits.

And then the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, himself a Gold Star father, got involved and said the president's words were meant to be warm and admiring. Where does this leave us?
Some prominent Republican senators want the caucus to try to legitimately work with Democrats. McConnell attempted to use that very threat — working with Democrats — as a cudgel to get conservatives to vote for it. Apparently, that was a bluff, as he intends to see how far he can push governing along party lines.
GREENE: And let's turn to NPR's correspondent based in Paris, Eleanor Beardsley, who joins us this morning and watched all of this unfold yesterday. Hi, Eleanor.

So I think at the time - and at a moment of massive income and wealth inequality, we must demand that the wealthiest people in this country and the largest corporations start paying their fair share of taxes. I think we ought to take a hard look at the military budget, which is increasing rapidly. It will be $750 billion a year next year. And that is spending more than the next 10 nations combined.

When problems have arisen, Obama has often used his executive authority to try to solve them. And it's this very mechanism Trump could use to undermine the law. As president, the Republican can just reverse Obama's actions in many cases, said Nicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan who writes about health policy. A president can't undo the basic architecture of the law, but you can throw sand into the gears, he said.
The report by the independent GAO was requested in January by senior Democrats on the Senate and House tax-writing committees who asked for an analysis of withholding tables under the new Republican tax law, according to AP.
