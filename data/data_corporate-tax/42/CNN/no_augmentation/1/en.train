{"original": "Missouri is the site of one of the nation's most competitive Senate races. Sen. Claire McCaskill, who represents that state, which voted for Trump by almost 19 points, is one of the most vulnerable Democrats up in 2018. She faces Republican state Attorney General Josh Hawley in a race that both sides are focusing on for control of the upper chamber. Democrats have attacked Hawley's record as attorney general and focused on health care, while Republicans have criticized McCaskill for voting against the Republican tax bill and using a private plane to get around the state. McCaskill won re-election in 2012, when Obama lost Missouri by 10 points, but the state has moved to the right since then. Whatever the outcome, this could be one of the closest races in the country, and it could keep results-watchers up late, as heavily Democratic St. Louis County traditionally is late to announce its results.", "augmented": []}

The House can pass articles of impeachment quickly, but it is unlikely the Senate could pull off a trial before the President's term ended. Some Democrats worry that trying him in the new Senate, which they are allowed to do, would take focus away from a new President Biden's agenda.

{"original": "No awards or honors should be bestowed from your town, group or organization. No commencement speeches or honorary degrees from colleges and universities.

{"original": "Many workers who don't have access to an employer-sponsored 401(k) opt to save in an IRA instead. If you're one of them, and neither you nor your spouse is covered by a retirement plan at work, then you'll get to deduct whatever contribution you made last year from your income. Keep in mind that it's actually not too late to fund your 2017 IRA if you haven't already maxed out. You have until the April 17 tax filing deadline to contribute up to $5,500 for the 2017 tax year if you're under 50, or up to $6,500 if you're 50 or older.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Though you need to meet certain criteria to be eligible to contribute to a health savings account, or HSA, if you put money into such an account last year, you can use those contributions to reduce your taxable income. Among other benefits, the money that goes into HSAs gets to grow tax-free, so if you have a high-deductible plan, it pays to see whether an HSA makes sense for you going forward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you moved for a job last year, let's hope you kept track of the expenses you incurred. That's because you're allowed to deduct costs such as hiring movers and paying for storage that helped you relocate for work purposes. To be eligible for the moving expense deduction, your new job must be at least 50 miles further away than your last job was from your old home. You're also required to work for at least 39 weeks out of the 52-week period following your move. But if you meet these criteria, you can deduct your moving costs even if you have no intention of itemizing. Keep in mind, however, that 2017 is the last tax year for which you can take this deduction, as it was eliminated under the recent tax overhaul.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you're on the hook for alimony to a former spouse, you can deduct those payments on your 2017 taxes even without itemizing. But future divorcees may not get that option, as the alimony deduction will be eliminated for all divorces finalized after Dec. 31, 2018.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you're a teacher, you've probably encountered your share of scenarios where you've had to buy classroom supplies using your own money. As long as you retained those receipts, you can deduct up to $250 worth of expenses on your tax return this year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Depending on your income, you may be eligible to write off up to $2,500 in student loan interest on your tax return, regardless of whether you itemize. To snag this deduction, the loan in question must be one you took out to pay for your own higher education costs, or those of a spouse or dependent of yours. Furthermore, to deduct that interest, your tax filing status can't be married filing separately, and you can't be listed as a dependent on someone else's tax return.", "augmented": []}

All objections will be voted on -- and are expected to fail. So in the end, GOP objections will most likely serve as a marker of loyalty to the President, rather than actually affect the results. They could also cast a shadow over future democratic processes and maintain the seed of doubt among Trump supporters who believe his false claims that the election was stolen from him.

To illustrate, the radical corporate income tax cuts in President Trump's signature tax bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, led to a rise in stock prices that benefitted stock owners, tax-free.

Many upper-income earners would be tempted to move, or retire, or shift their financial plans to show fewer wages and all of them, as workers, are shouldering a hefty tax burden as is.

{"original": "2) With every passing day, President Donald Trump hunkers down deeper into his demand for $5 billion in federal funding to build a border wall with Mexico.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Those two realities are creating a slow-motion disaster for Republicans, the vast majority of whom – OK, everyone but Donald Trump – are powerless to do absolutely anything about it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Let's break it down – point by point.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A series of national polls conducted and released over the past week leave no doubt that a majority of the public blames Trump and Republicans for the ongoing shutdown. In a CNN poll out over the weekend, 55% blamed Trump for the shutdown while 32% said it was congressional Democrats at fault. (A majority – 56% – opposed the construction of a wall along the entirety of the southern US border with Mexico.) In a Washington Post-ABC News poll from this weekend, the results were very similar; 53% said the shutdown blame falls primarily on Trump and Republicans while 29% blamed Democrats in Congress. There's plenty more recent polling that gets at that same idea: People blame Trump and Republicans for this shutdown and believe the cause of the shutdown – a border wall – won't solve the problems posed by immigration.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And yet, in the face of this avalanche of polling data – remember when Trump couldn't wait to tout the results of the latest poll in the 2016 GOP primary?? – Trump seems entirely unable or unwilling to bend. He's not going to budge even 1 inch, a source familiar with Trump's thinking told CNN's Jeremy Diamond on Monday. (That same source told Diamond that Trump keeps citing increased support for a border wall – 42% support for it in the WaPo-ABC poll – as evidence he is winning. Of course, 54% of people in that same poll oppose the wall, so …)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Trump's tweets of late seem similarly detached from reality.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Nancy and Cryin' Chuck can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes, he typed Monday morning. At this point it has become their, and the Democrats, fault!", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This is all sorts of bad if you are a Republican elected official.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What we know from modern political history is that the public tends to blame one party for these shutdowns – unless they are of a very short duration. This one is not that. We also know that, barring some sort of major news event that upends conventional wisdom, once people make their minds up about who they think is at fault in government, they rarely change their collective minds.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you are a congressional Republican, the feeling is somewhere between utter frustration and total futility. You know that every day this shutdown goes, things get worse for your party, politically speaking, You also know that telling Trump any of this makes him more likely to hunker down even further. And don't forget, you are a little – or more than a little – scared of the President's ire, and what it may mean for your political future.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What do do? Well, most Republicans have largely thrown up their hands. Take Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the man who, during past potential (and realized) shutdowns during the Obama administration, stepped in to cut a deal. He's been largely on the sidelines in this shutdown – by his own choosing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Ultimately the solution to this is a deal between the president and Nancy and Chuck, because we need some of Chuck's votes, and obviously, we need Nancy's support, McConnell told Politico recently.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He's also made clear that unless and until Trump goes public with a specific legislative proposal, there's no point in having a series of show votes on the Senate floor for measures the President won't sign. (Left unsaid but without question a calculation for McConnell is putting his vulnerable 2020 members on the record with votes that will never go anywhere.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The truth here is that congressional Republicans threw their lot in with Trump – totally and completely – shortly after he won the White House. They did so because they thought doing so would get them what they wanted – tax cuts, conservative Supreme Court justices – even if it meant swallowing their pride and their past views on things like the danger posed by the rapidly growing national debt.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When they latched themselves to Trump, they did so for good and for bad. This moment – a flailing President unwilling to see he made a bad bet and who keeps throwing good political money after bad – was completely predictable. That doesn't make it any easier for congressional Republicans to endure; the President is lighting their political brand on fire while insisting everything is not only fine but that he is, in fact winning.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Debt is not always a bad thing. In fact, there are instances where the leveraging power of a loan actually helps put you in a better overall financial position. Here are a few:", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The chance that you can pay for a new home in cash is slim. Carefully consider how much you can afford to put down and how much loan you can carry. The more you put down, the less you'll owe and the less you'll pay in interest over time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Although it may seem logical to spend every available dime to cut your interest payments, it's not always the best move. You need to consider other issues, such as your need for cash reserves and what your investments are earning.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Also, don't pour all your cash into a home if you have other debt. Mortgages tend to have lower interest rates than other debt, and you may deduct the interest you pay on the first $1 million of a mortgage loan. (If your mortgage has a high rate, you can always refinance later if rates fall. Use our mortgage calculator to determine how much you might save.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A 20% down payment is traditional and may help buyers get the best mortgage deals. Many homebuyers do put down less -- as little as 3% in some cases. But if you do, you'll end up paying higher monthly mortgage bills because you're borrowing more money, and you will have to pay for primary mortgage insurance (PMI), which protects the lender in the event you default.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For more on financing a home, read Money Essentials: Buying a home.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When it comes to paying for your children's education, allowing your kids to take loans makes far more sense than liquidating or borrowing against your retirement fund. That's because your kids have plenty of financial sources to draw on for college, but no one is going to give you a scholarship for your retirement. What's more, a big 401(k) balance won't count against you if you apply for financial aid since retirement savings are not counted as available assets.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's also unwise to borrow against your home to cover tuition. If you run into financial difficulties down the road, you risk losing the house.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Your best bet is to save what you can for your kids' educations without compromising your own financial health. Then let your kids borrow what you can't provide, especially if they are eligible for a government-backed Perkins or Stafford loans, which are based on need. Such loans have guaranteed low rates; no interest payments are due until after graduation; and interest paid is tax-deductible under certain circumstances.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "It makes sense to pay for a car outright if you plan to keep it until it dies or for longer than the term of a high-interest car loan or pricey lease. It's also smart to use cash if that money is unlikely to earn more invested than what you would pay in loan interest.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Most people, however, can't afford to put down 100%. So the goal is to put down as much as possible without jeopardizing your other financial goals and emergency fund. Typically, you won't be able to get a car loan without putting down at least 10%. A loan makes most sense if you want to buy a new car and plan to keep driving it long after your loan payments have stopped.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You may be tempted to use a home equity loan when buying a car because you're likely to get a lower interest rate than you would on an auto loan, and the interest is tax-deductible. But make sure you can afford the payments. If you default, you could lose your home.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Leasing a car might be your best bet if the following applies: you want a new car every three or four years; you want to avoid a down payment of 10% to 20%; you don't drive more than the 15,000 miles a year allowed in most leases; and you keep your vehicle in good condition so that you avoid end-of-lease penalties.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Taking a home equity loan or home equity line of credit makes sense if you're making home improvements that increase the value of your house, such as adding a family room or renovating your kitchen. The interest you pay in many cases is deductible, and you increase your equity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If, however, a home project doesn't boost your house value, consider paying cash or taking out a short-term, low-interest loan that will be paid off in five years or less.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "If you're saddled with a lot of high-interest credit card debt, you might be tempted to pay it off quickly by borrowing from your 401(k) or taking out a home equity loan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There are two primary advantages to home equity loans: They typically charge interest rates that are less than half what most credit cards charge. Plus, the interest you pay may be deductible. (Note, however, that when you use a home equity loan for nonhousing expenses, you may only deduct the interest paid on the first $100,000 of the loan, according to the National Association of Tax Practitioners.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But there is one potential and very significant drawback when you borrow against your house to pay off credit cards: If you default on your home equity loan payments, you may lose your home.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Borrowing from your 401(k) is even less advisable. That's because you lose out on two of the biggest advantages to workplace retirement plans: tax-deferred compounding of your money and tax-deductible contributions. Sure, you pay yourself back with interest, but that interest is paid with after-tax dollars, and it will be harder for you to make new contributions while you're repaying your old loan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Also, if you quit or lose your job, you'll probably have to repay the entire borrowed amount within three months. If you aren't able to do that, you'll owe income taxes on the money, plus a 10% penalty if you're under 59-1/2.", "augmented": []}

The first step in the plan would be to get rid of the credit card debt, and you decide that your goal is to pay it off within one year. You fire up a debt calculator and discover that if you pay an extra $400 per month on your credit card over and above the minimum payment, you'll have it paid off in 11 months. You scrape together the extra $400 by cutting back on expenses, and get it paid off on schedule (don't forget to reward yourself for reaching your first goal!).", "augmented": []}

Currently, the economy is at full employment, but the government is running substantial deficits. Low revenues are a big part of the problem; they do not come close to funding current spending.

But federal taxes as a share of their income have fallen — from 35% in 1979 to 33% in 2015 — and the 2017 tax cuts reduced them further. In a progressive system like ours, the tax share of income should rise as income rises. High-income households are due for a significant increase in tax burdens.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Third, higher tax burdens on the wealthy would reduce (what economists call) rent seeking, the appropriation of wealth from others without creating new wealth. Studies have shown that countries with lower top marginal tax rates have higher pre-tax income inequality. The logic is that, while lower tax rates on high-income households — introduced in the Reagan, Bush and Trump tax cuts — may have stimulated labor supply and saving, they also raised the return to rent seeking, encouraging, for example, executives to capture a larger share of profits, at the expense of wage earners. Thus, some of the top 1%'s impressive gains may well have come at the expense of, rather than benefit to, the rest of the population.", "augmented": []}

Once you get to the tippie-tops, on your $10 millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60% or 70%. That doesn't mean all $10 million dollars are taxed at an extremely high rate. But it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The nation's top income tax rate was 70% in the 1970s, though the tax system was much different back then. It dropped significantly during the Reagan and George H.W.

{"original": "Since Ocasio-Cortez has not yet offered a detailed formal proposal, the center has not calculated how much additional revenue raising the top rate to 70% could bring in. But it's likely that high earners would try to shift their income into capital gains – by being paid in stock, deferring compensation or other methods – in order to minimize the tax hit, Gleckman said.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Simply raising a tax rate on an existing base is not going to do very much, said David Kamin, a law professor at New York University and former special assistant for economic poilcy in the Obama administration.

{"original": "I'm going to be looking for some of those changes: releasing political prisoner, ending some of the oppressive practices on the press, opening up the economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Of course the United States stands ready. And, as president, I would be ready to reach out and work with a new Cuban government, once it demonstrated that it truly was going to change that direction.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I want to bring the region together, our European allies who have influence with Cuba, to try to push for some of those changes, and to make it very clear that, if Cuba moves toward democracy and freedom for its people, the United States will welcome that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: And as president, I would look for opportunities to try to make that happen and to create the momentum that might eventually lead to a presidential visit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But there has to be evidence that indeed the changes are real; that they are taking place; and that the Cuban people will finally be given an opportunity to have their future determined by themselves.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "RAMOS: Very simply, would you meet with him or not, with Raul Castro?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: I would not meet with him until there was evidence that change was happening, because I think it's important that they demonstrate clearly that they are committed to change the direction. Then I think, you know, something like diplomatic encounters and negotiations over specifics could take place.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But we've had this conversation before, Senator Obama and myself, and I believe that we should have full diplomatic engagement where appropriate. But a presidential visit should not be offered and given without some evidence that it will demonstrate the kind of progress that is in our interest, and in this case, in the interests of the Cuban people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: Senator Obama, just to follow up, you had said in a previous CNN debate that you would meet with the leaders of Cuban, Iran, North Korea, among others, so presumably you would be willing to meet with the new leader of Cuba.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: That's correct. Now, keep in mind that the starting point for our policy in Cuba should be the liberty of the Cuban people. And I think we recognize that that liberty has not existed throughout the Castro regime. And we now have an opportunity to potentially change the relationship between the United States and Cuba after over half a century.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I would meet without preconditions, although Senator Clinton is right that there has to be preparation. It is very important for us to make sure that there was an agenda, and on that agenda was human rights, releasing of political prisoners, opening up the press. And that preparation might take some time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But I do think that it's important for the United States not just to talk to its friends, but also to talk to its enemies. In fact, that's where diplomacy makes the biggest difference.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: One other thing that I've said, as a show of good faith that we're interested in pursuing potentially a new relationship, what I've called for is a loosening of the restrictions on remittances from family members to the people of Cuba, as well as travel restrictions for family members who want to visit their family members in Cuba.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I think that initiating that change in policy as a start and then suggesting that an agenda get set up is something that could be useful, but I would not normalize relations until we started seeing some of the progress that Senator Clinton was talking about.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: But that's different from your position back in 2003. You called U.S. policy toward Cuba a miserable failure, and you supported normalizing relations.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: I support the eventual normalization. And it's absolutely true that I think our policy has been a failure. I mean, the fact is, is that during my entire lifetime, and Senator Clinton's entire lifetime, you essentially have seen a Cuba that has been isolated, but has not made progress when it comes to the issues of political rights and personal freedoms that are so important to the people of Cuba.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So I think that we have to shift policy. I think our goal has to be ultimately normalization. But that's going to happen in steps. And the first step, as I said, is changing our rules with respect to remittances and with respect to travel.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And then I think it is important for us to have the direct contact, not just in Cuba, but I think this principle applies generally. I recall what John F. Kennedy once said, that we should never negotiate out of fear, but we should never fear to negotiate. And this moment, this opportunity when Fidel Castro has finally stepped down, I think, is one that we should try to take advantage of.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: Senator Clinton, do you want a quick response?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, I agree, absolutely, that we should be willing to have diplomatic negotiations and processes with anyone. I've been a strong advocate of opening up such a diplomatic process with Iran, for a number of years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Because I think we should look for ways that we can possibly move countries that are adversarial to us, you know, toward the world community. It's in our interests. It's in the interests of the people in countries that, frankly, are oppressed, like Cuba, like Iran.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But there has been this difference between us over when and whether the president should offer a meeting, without preconditions, with those with whom we do not have diplomatic relations. And it should be part of a process, but I don't think it should be offered in the beginning. Because I think that undermines the capacity for us to actually take the measure of somebody like Raul Castro or Ahmadinejad and others.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: And, as President Kennedy said, he wouldn't be afraid to negotiate, but he would expect there to be a lot of preparatory work done, to find out exactly what we would get out of it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And therefore, I do think we should be eliminating the policy of the Bush administration, which has been very narrowly defined, and frankly against our interests, because we have failed to reach out to countries, we have alienated our friends, and we have emboldened our enemies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So I would get back to very vigorous diplomacy, and I would use bipartisan diplomacy. I would ask emissaries from both political parties to represent me and our country, because I want to send a very clear message to the rest of the world that the era of unilateralism, preemption and arrogance of the Bush administration is over and we're going to...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: Very briefly and then we're going to move on.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: I think, as I said before, preparation is actually absolutely critical in any meeting. And I think it is absolutely true that either of us would step back from some of the Bush unilateralism that's caused so much damage.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But I do think it is important precisely because the Bush administration has done so much damage to American foreign relations that the president take a more active role in diplomacy than might have been true 20 or 30 years ago.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Because the problem is, if we think that meeting with the president is a privilege that has to be earned, I think that reinforces the sense that we stand above the rest of the world at this point in time. And I think that it's important for us in undoing the damage that has been done over the last seven years, for the president to be willing to take that extra step.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "For some, that is a question about: What should we do about an economy that is at the edge or perhaps in the early stages of a recession? For some, it is more focused. Maybe it is: Will you raise the minimum wage? Maybe it's about trade deals that they think leave them on the raw end, as you mentioned in your opening statement, Senator Obama.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Everywhere you go, you meet people who are working harder for less, wages and incomes have flatlined, people are seeing escalating costs of everything from health care to gas at the pump.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Number one, with our tax code: We've got to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas and invest those tax breaks in companies that are investing here in the United States of America.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We have to end the Bush tax cuts to the wealthy...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... and to provide tax breaks to middle-class Americans and working Americans who need them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: So I've said that if you are making $75,000 a year or less, I want to give an offset to your payroll tax that will mean $1,000 extra in the pockets of ordinary Americans. Senior citizens making less than $50,000, you shouldn't have to pay income tax on your Social Security.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We pay for these by closing tax loopholes and tax havens that are being manipulated.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "On our trade deals, I think it is absolutely critical that we engaged in trade, but it has to be viewed not just through the lens of Wall Street, but also Main Street, which means we've got strong labor standards and strong environmental standards and safety standards, so we don't have toys being shipped in the United States with lead paint on them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So these are all issues that I've talked about repeatedly, and I think there are also opportunities in our economy around creating a green economy. We send $1 billion to foreign countries every day because of our addiction to foreign oil.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: And for us to move rapidly to cap greenhouse gases, generate billions of dollars that we can reinvest in solar and wind and biodiesel -- that can put people back to work. So...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, I don't want to take too much time. And I'm sure we'll be spend more time discussing this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Senator Clinton and I, I think, both agree on many of these issues. And I think it's a credit to the Democratic Party as a whole that the other candidates who were involved earlier on agreed with us on many of these issues.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I think that there is a real, solid agenda for moving change forward in the next presidency.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The question people are going to have to ask is: How do we get it done?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And it is my strong belief that the changes are only going to come about if we're able to form a working coalition for change. Because people who were benefiting from the current tax code are going to resist. The special interests and lobbyists are going to resist.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I think it has to be a priority for whoever the next president is to be able to overcome the dominance of the special interests in Washington, to bring about the kinds of economic changes that I'm talking about.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: And that's an area where Senator Clinton and I may have a slight difference. But I'm happy to let her speak first and then can pick up on anything that's been left out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "KING: Let's give Senator Clinton that opportunity then.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As you have campaigned, Senator, on this issue and others, but specifically on this issue, you have said, I am ready on day one to take charge of the economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The clear implication, since you have one opponent at the moment, is that you're ready; he's not.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What would you do differently on day one than a President Obama would when it comes to managing the nation's economy?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, I would agree with a lot that Senator Obama just said, because it is the Democratic agenda.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: We are going to rid the tax code of these loopholes and giveaways.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We're going to stop giving a penny of your money to anybody who ships a job out of Texas, Ohio or anywhere else to another country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We're certainly going to begin to get the tax code to reflect what the needs of middle class families are so we can rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You know, the wealthy and the well-connected have had a president the last seven years, and I think it's time that the rest of America had a president to work for you every single day.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We will also have a different approach toward trade.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We're going to start having trade agreements that not only have strong environmental and labor standards, but I want to have a trade time-out. We're going to look and see what's working and what's not working, and I'd like to have a trade prosecutor to actually enforce the trade agreements that we have before we enter into any others.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We're also going to put much tougher standards in place so that people cannot import toys with lead paint, contaminated pet food, contaminated drugs into our market. We're going to have much more vigorous enforcement of safety standards.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: Now, in addition, there are steps I would take immediately. One is on this foreclosure crisis. I have been saying for nearly a year we had to crack down on the abusive practices of the lenders. But we also need a moratorium on home foreclosures.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Everywhere I go, I meet people who either have been or about to lose their home. 85,000 homes in foreclosure in Texas; 90,000 in Ohio. I've met the families: the hairdresser, the single mom who's going to lose her home, the postal worker who got really hoodwinked into an agreement that wasn't fair to him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So I would put a moratorium for 90 days, to give us time to work out a way for people to stay in their homes, and I would freeze interest rates for five years. Because these adjustable-rate mortgages, if they keep going up, millions of Americans are going to be homeless. And vacant homes will be across the neighborhoods of Texas and America.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: Now, in addition, there are three ways we need to jump start the economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Clean green jobs; I've been promoting this. I wanted it to be part of the stimulus package. I thought a $5 billion investment in clean green jobs would put hundreds of thousands of Americans to work helping to create our future.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We also need to invest in our infrastructure. We don't have enough roads to take care of the congestion, we have crumbling bridges and tunnels. We need to rebuild America, and that will also put people to work.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And, finally, we need to end George Bush's war on science, which has been waged against scientists and researchers...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: Thank you, Senator. And we've got a lot of ground to cover...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: This is about how we fund the future. We've got to get back to being the innovation nation. Think of everything that goes on at this great university to create the new economy...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: All right. Senator Clinton, thank you very much.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: And, as I was saying, we've got a lot to get through. So I do want to shift gears and go on to another topic especially important here in Texas, which is immigration.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And, Jorge, you have a question.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "RAMOS: (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Federal raids by immigration enforcement officials on homes and businesses have generated a great deal of fear and anxiety in the Hispanic community and have divided the family of some of the 3 million U.S.-born children who have at least one undocumented parent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Would you consider stopping these raids once you take office until comprehensive immigration reform can be passed?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: I would consider that, except in egregious situations where it would be appropriate to take the actions you're referring to.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But when we see what's been happening, with literally babies being left with no one to take care of them, children coming home from school, no responsible adult left, that is not the America that I know.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: That is against American values. And it is...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And it is a stark admission of failure by the federal government. We need comprehensive immigration reform. I have been for this. I signed onto the first comprehensive bill back in 2004. I've been advocating for it: tougher, more secure borders, of course, but let's do it the right way, cracking down on employers, especially once we get to comprehensive immigration reform, who exploit undocumented workers and drive down wages for everyone else.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I'd like to see more federal help for communities like Austin and others like Laredo, where I was this morning, that absorb the health care, education, and law enforcement costs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I personally, as president, would work with our neighbors to the south, to help them create more jobs for their own people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Finally, we need a path to legalization, to bring the immigrants out of the shadows, give them the conditions that we expect them to meet, paying a fine for coming here illegally, trying to pay back taxes, over time, and learning English.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If they had a committed a crime in our country or the country they came from, then they should be deported. But for everyone else, there must be a path to legalization. I would introduce that in the first 100 days of my presidency.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: Senator Obama, is your position the same as Hillary Clinton's?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: There are a couple of things I would add. Comprehensive immigration reform is something that I have worked on extensively.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Two years ago, we were able to get a bill out of the Senate. I was one of the group of senators that helped to move it through, but it died in the House this year. Because it was used as a political football instead of a way of solving a problem, nothing happened.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And so there are a couple of things that I would just add to what Senator Clinton said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Number one, it is absolutely critical that we tone down the rhetoric when it comes to the immigration debate, because there has been an undertone that has been ugly.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Oftentimes, it has been directed at the Hispanic community. We have seen hate crimes skyrocket in the wake of the immigration debate as it has been conducted in Washington, and that is unacceptable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We are a nation of laws and we are a nation of immigrants, and we can reconcile those two things. So we need comprehensive reform...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... we need comprehensive reform, and that means stronger border security. It means that we are cracking down on employers that are taking advantage of undocumented workers because they can't complain if they're not paid a minimum wage.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: They can't complain if they're not getting overtime. Worker safety laws are not being observed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We have to crack down on those employers, although we also have to make sure that we do it in a way that doesn't lead to people with Spanish surnames being discriminated against, so there's got to be a safeguard there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We have to require that undocumented workers, who are provided a pathway to citizenship, not only learn English, pay back taxes and pay a significant fine, but also that they're going to the back of the line, so that they are not getting citizenship before those who have applied legally, which raises two last points.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Number one, it is important that we fix the legal immigration system, because right now we've got a backlog that means years for people to apply legally.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And what's worse is, we keep on increasing the fees, so that if you've got a hard working immigrant family, they've got to hire a lawyer; they've got to pay thousands of dollars in fees. They just can't afford it. And it's discriminatory against people who have good character, we should want in this country, but don't have the money. So we've got to fix that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: So we've got to fix that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The second thing is, we have to improve our relationship with Mexico and work with the Mexican government so that their economy is producing jobs on that side of the border.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And the problem that we have...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The problem that we have is that we have had an administration that came in promising all sorts of leadership on creating a U.S.- Mexican relationship. And, frankly, President Bush dropped the ball. He has been so obsessed with Iraq that we have not seen the kinds of outreach and cooperative work that would ensure that the Mexican economy is working not just for the very wealthy in Mexico, but for all people. And that's as policy that I'm going to change when I'm president of the United States.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We're going to stay with this topic. I want to have John King ask another question.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "KING: I want to stay on the issue, but move to a controversial item that was not held up when the immigration debate collapsed in Washington, and that is the border fence.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "KING: To many Americans, it is a simple question of sovereignty and security. America should be able to keep people out that it doesn't want in.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But, as you know in this state, especially if you go to the south of here, along the border, and in other border states, to many people it's a much more personal question. It could be a question of their livelihood. It could be a question of cross-border trade. It might be an issue to a rancher of property rights. It might be a simple question of whether someone can take a walk or a short drive to see their family members.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Senator, back in 2006, you voted for the construction of that fence. As you know, progress has been slow.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As president of the United States, would you commit tonight that you would finish the fence and speed up the construction, or do you think it's time for a president of the United States to raise his or her hand and say, You know what? Wait a minute. Let's think about this again. Do we really want to do this?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, I think both Senator Obama and I voted for that as part of the immigration debate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: And having been along the border for the last week or so -- in fact, last night I was at the University of Texas at Brownsville -- and this is how absurd this has become under the Bush administration. Because, you know, there is a smart way to protect our borders, and there is a dumb way to protect our borders.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And what I learned last night when I was there with Congressman Ortiz is that the University of Texas at Brownsville would have part of its campus cut off.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This is the kind of absurdity that we're getting from this administration. I know it because I've been fighting with them about the northern border. Their imposition of passports and other kinds of burdens are separating people from families, interfering with business and commerce, the movement of goods and people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So what I've said is that I would say, wait a minute, we need to review this. There may be places where a physical barrier is appropriate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I think when both of us voted for this, we were voting for the possibility that where it was appropriate and made sense, it would be considered. But as with so much, the Bush administration has gone off the deep end, and they are unfortunately coming up with a plan that I think is counterproductive.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: So I would have a review. I would listen to the people who live along the border, who understand...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... what it is we need to be doing to protect our country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: Let me go on, again -- John?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "KING: Does that mean that you think your vote was wrong, or the implementation of it was wrong?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Because, as you know, when they first built the fence in the San Diego area, it only went so far. And what it did was it sopped the people coming straight up the path of where that was built, and they simply moved. And California's problem became Arizona's problem.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: But, you know, John, there is -- there's a lot we've learned about technology and smart fencing. You know, there is technology that can be used instead of a physical barrier.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: It requires us having enough personnel along the border so that people can be supervising a certain limited amount of space and will be able to be responsive in the event of people attempting to cross illegally.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I think that the way that the Bush administration is going about this, filing eminent domain actions against landowners and municipalities, makes no sense.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So what I have said is, yes, there are places when after a careful review, again listening to the people who live along the border, there may be limited places where it would work. But let's deploy more technology and personnel, instead of the physical barrier.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I frankly think that will work better and it will give us an opportunity to secure our borders without interfering with family relations, business relations, recreation and so much else that makes living along the border, you know, wonderful.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: And the people who live there need to have a president who understands it, will listen to them and be responsive.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: Well, this is an area where Senator Clinton and I almost entirely agree. I think that the key is to consult with local communities, whether it's on the commercial interests or the environmental stakes of creating any kind of barrier.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And the Bush administration is not real good at listening. That's not what they do well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And so I will reverse that policy. As Senator Clinton indicated, there may be areas where it makes sense to have some fencing. But for the most part, having border patrolled, surveillance, deploying effective technology, that's going to be the better approach.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The one thing I do have to say, though, about this issue is, it is very important for us, I think, to deal with this problem in terms of thousands of -- hundreds of thousands of people coming over the borders on a regular basis if we want to also provide opportunity for the 12 million undocumented workers who are here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: Senator Clinton and I have both campaigned in places like Iowa and Ohio and my home state of Illinois, and I think that the American people want fairness, want justice. I think they recognize that the idea that you're going to deport 12 million people is ridiculous, that we're not going to be devoting all our law enforcement resources...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But what they do also want is some order to the process. And so, we're not going to be able to do these things in isolation. We're not going to be able to deal with the 12 million people who are living in the shadows and give them a way of getting out of the shadows if we don't also deal with the problem of this constant influx of undocumented workers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And that's why I think comprehensive reform is so important. That's the kind of leadership that I've shown in the past; that's the kind of leadership that I'll show in the future.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "One last point I want to make on the immigration issue because we may be moving to different topics: Something that we can do immediately that I think is very important is to pass the Dream Act, which allows children who through no fault of their own are here but have essentially grown up as Americans, allow them the opportunity for higher education.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: I do not want two classes of citizens in this country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I want everybody to prosper. That's going to be a top priority.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: OK, we've got one last question on immigration.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "RAMOS: (SPEAKING SPANISH) Right now, there are more than 30 million people in this country who speak Spanish.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Many of them are right here. By the year 2050, there will be 120 million Hispanics in the United States. Now, is there any downside, Senator Clinton, to the United States becoming (SPEAKING SPANISH) becoming a bilingual nation? Is there a limit?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, I think it's important for as many Americans as possible to do what I have never been able to do, and that is learn another language and try to be bilingual because that connects us to the rest of the world.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I think it is important, though, that English remain our common unifying language because that brings our country together in a way that we have seen generations of immigrants coming to our shores be able to be part of the American experience and pursue the American dream.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You know, I have been adamantly against the efforts by some to make English the official language. That I do not believe is appropriate, and I have voted against it and spoken against it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: I represent New York. We have 170 languages in New York City alone. And I do not think that we should be, in any way, discriminating against people who do not speak English, who use facilities like hospitals or have to go to court to enforce their rights.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But I do think that English does remain an important part of the American experience. So I encourage people to become bilingual. But I also want to see English remain the common, unifying language of our country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "RAMOS: Senator Obama, is there any down side to the United States becoming a bilingual nation?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: Well, I think it is important that everyone learns English and that we have that process of binding ourselves together as a country. I think that's very important.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I also think that every student should be learning a second language, because...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... you know, so, when you start getting into a debate about bilingual education, for example, now, I want to make sure that children who are coming out of Spanish-speaking households had the opportunity to learn and are not falling behind.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: If bilingual education helps them do that, I want to give them the opportunity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But I also want to make sure that English-speaking children are getting foreign languages because this world is becoming more interdependent and part of the process of America's continued leadership in the world is going to be our capacity to communicate across boundaries, across borders, and that's something frankly where we've fallen behind.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "One of the failures of No Child Left Behind, a law that I think a lot of local and state officials have been troubled by, is that it is so narrowly focused on standardized tests that it has pushed out a lot of important learning that needs to take place.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And foreign languages is one of those areas that I think has been neglected. I want to put more resources into it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We're going to take a quick break. We've got to go to a commercial. We'll be back with a lot more. There is also a debate we should mention raging online right now. Go to our Web site, CNNpolitics.com, and join in. The debate here at the University of Texas in Austin continues right after this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: And we are back. We're here in Austin, Texas, the capital city. Welcome back to the Texas Democratic debate at the University of Texas, Austin.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The first question now goes to John King.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "KING: Senator, as I'm sitting here, we're about 45 minutes into the discussion tonight, and I'm having what I like to call one of those parallel universe moments.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I've been watching each of you give speeches in arenas not unlike this one individually. And the tone is often quite different than the very polite, substantive discourse we've had tonight.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And so, I want to ask you about that. There are times when each of you seems to call into question the other one's credibility or truthfulness.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And, Senator Clinton, I want to talk specifically about some words you've spoken here in the state of Texas over the past couple of days.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You've said, quote, My opponent gives speeches; I offer solutions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You said the choice for Democrats in this campaign is, quote, talk versus action.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, in a campaign that some of us are old enough to remember, maybe not many of the students here, this would be called the Where's the beef? question.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But, since we're in Texas, I'd like to borrow a phrase that they often use here and you've used yourself in the context of President Bush. Are you saying that your opponent is all hat and no cattle, and can you say that after the last 45 minutes?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, I have said that about President Bush, and I think our next president needs to be a lot less hat and a lot more cattle.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You know, I think you can tell from the first 45 minutes, you know, Senator Obama and I have a lot in common. We both care passionately about our country. We are devoted to public service. We care deeply about the future, and we have run a very vigorous and contested primary campaign, which has been by most standards, I think, very positive and extremely civil.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: But there are differences between us. And I think, in our efforts to draw those contrasts and comparisons, we obviously try to let voters know how we see the world differently.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I do offer solutions. That's what I believe in and what I have done. And it's what I offer to voters because it's part of my life, over the last 35 years, working to get kids health care, working to expand legal services for the poor, working to register voters, working to make a difference. Because I think that this country has given me so much.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And there are differences between our records and our accomplishments. I have to confess, I was somewhat amused, the other night, when, on one of the TV shows, one of Senator Obama's supporters couldn't.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So I know that there are comparisons and contrasts to be drawn between us. And it's important that voters get that information. So, yes, I do think that words are important and words matter, but actions speak louder than words. And I offer...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: Senator Obama, do you want to respond?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: Well, I think actions do speak louder than words, which is why over the 20 years of my public service I have acted a lot to provide health care to people who didn't have it, to provide tax breaks to families that needed it, to reform a criminal justice system that had resulted in wrongful convictions, to open up our government and to pass the toughest ethics reform legislation since Watergate, to make sure that we create transparency...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... to make sure that we create transparency in our government so that we know where federal spending is going and it's not going to a bunch of boondoggles and earmarks that are wasting taxpayer money that could be spent on things like early childhood education.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You know, I think if you talk to those wounded warriors at Walter Reed who, prior to me getting to the Senate, were having to pay for their meals and have to pay for their phone calls to their family while they're recovering from amputations, I think they've said that I've engaged not just in talk, but in action.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: Now, I think that Senator Clinton has a fine record and I don't want to denigrate that record. I do think there is a fundamental difference between us in terms of how change comes about. Senator Clinton of late has said: Let's get real. The implication is that the people who've been voting for me or involved in my campaign are somehow delusional.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And that, you know, the 20 million people who've been paying attention to 19 debates and the editorial boards all across the country at newspapers who have given me endorsements, including every major newspaper here in the state of Texas.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: You know, the thinking is that somehow, they're being duped, and eventually they're going to see the reality of things.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Well, I think they perceive reality of what's going on in Washington very clearly. What they see is that if we don't bring the country together, stop the endless bickering, actually focus on solutions and reduce the special interests that have dominated Washington, then we will not get anything done. And the reason that this campaign has done so well...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The reason that this campaign has done so well is because people understand that it is not just a matter of putting forward policy positions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: Senator Clinton and I share a lot of policy positions. But if we can't inspire the American people to get involved in their government and if we can't inspire them to go beyond the racial divisions and the religious divisions and the regional divisions that have plagued our politics for so long, then we will continue to see the kind of gridlock and nonperformance in Washington that is resulting in families suffering in very real ways.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I'm running for president to start doing something about that suffering, and so are the people who are behind my campaign.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: I think one of the points -- I think one of the points that John King was alluding to in talking about some of Senator Clinton's comments is there has been a lot of attention lately on some of your speeches, that they are very similar to some of the speeches by your friend and supporter Deval Patrick, the governor of Massachusetts, and Senator Clinton's campaign has made a big issue of this. To be blunt, they've accused you of plagiarism.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: Well, look, the -- first of all, it's not a lot of speeches. There are two lines in speeches that I've been giving over the last couple of weeks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I've been campaigning now for the last two years. Deval is a national co-chairman of my campaign, and suggested an argument that I share, that words are important. Words matter. And the implication that they don't I think diminishes how important it is to speak to the American people directly about making America as good as its promise. Barbara Jordan understood this as well as anybody.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: And the notion that I had plagiarized from somebody who was one of my national co-chairs...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... who gave me the line and suggested that I use it, I think, is silly, and...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... you know, this is where we start getting into silly season, in politics, and I think people start getting discouraged about it...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What they want is, how are we going to create good jobs and good wages?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "How are we going to provide health care to the American people?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "How are we going to make sure that college is affordable?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So what I've been talking about, in this speeches -- and I've got to admit, some of them are pretty good.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What I've been talking about is not just hope and not just inspiration. It's a $4,000 tuition credit for every student, every year, in exchange for national service...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... so that college becomes more affordable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: I've been talking about making sure that we change our tax code so that working families actually get relief. I have been talking about making sure that we bring an end to this war in Iraq so that we can start bringing our troops home and invest money here in the United States.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So just to finish up, these are very specific, concrete, detailed proposals, many of them which I have been working on for years now. Senator Clinton has a fine record. So do I. I'm happy to have a debate on the issues, but what we shouldn't be spending time doing is tearing each other down. We should be spending time lifting the country up.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: Senator Clinton, is it the silly season?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, I think that if your candidacy is going to be about words, then they should be your own words. That's, I think, a very simple proposition.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And, you know, lifting whole passages from someone else's speeches is not change you can believe in, it's change you can Xerox. And I just don't think...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: No, but, you know, but, Barack, it is.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Because, you know, if you look -- if you look -- if you look at the YouTube of these videos, it does raise questions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, there is no doubt that you are a passionate, eloquent speaker, and I applaud you for that. But when you look at what we face in this country, we do need to unite the country, but we have to unite it for a purpose around very specific goals.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: It is not enough to say, Let's come together. We know we're going to have to work hard to overcome the opposition of those who do not want the changes to get to universal health care.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You know, when I proposed a universal health care plan, as did Senator Edwards, we took a big risk, because we know it's politically controversial to say we're going to cover everyone.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And you chose not to do that. You chose to put forth a health care plan that will leave out at least 15 million people. That's a big difference.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When I said we should put a moratorium on home foreclosures, basically your response was, well, that wouldn't work.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And, you know, in the last week, even President Bush has said we have to do something like that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I just believe that we've got to look hard at the difficult challenges we face, especially after George Bush leaves the White House.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: The world will breathe a sigh of relief once he is gone. We all know that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But then we've got to do the hard work of not just bringing the country together, but overcoming a lot of the entrenched opposition to the very ideas that both of us believe in, and for some of us have been fighting for, for a very long time. You know, when I took on...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When I took on universal health care back in '93 and '94, it was against a firestorm of special interest opposition. I was more than happy to do that, because I believe passionately in getting quality affordable health care to every American.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I don't want to leave anybody out. I see the results of leaving people out. I am tired of health insurance companies deciding who will live or die in America.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: All right, Senator Clinton, thank you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: Well, I think that Senator Clinton mentioned two specific issue areas where we've got some differences. I'm happy to debate those, which is what I think should be the focus of this campaign. We both want universal health care.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When I released my plan a few months later, we were in a debate and Senator Clinton said we all want universal health care. Of course, I was down 20 points in the polls at the time, and so my plan was pretty good. It's not as good now, but my plan hasn't changed. The politics have changed a little bit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We both -- 95 percent of our plans are similar. We both want to set up a system in which any person is going to be able to get coverage that is as good as we have as members of Congress. And we are going to subsidize those who can't afford it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: We're going to make sure that we reduce costs by emphasizing prevention. And I want to make sure that we're applying technology to improve quality, cut bureaucracy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, I also want to make sure that we're reducing costs for those who already have health insurance. So we put in place a catastrophic reinsurance plan that would reduce costs by $2,500 per family per year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So we've got a lot of similarities in our plan. We've got a philosophical difference, which we've debated repeatedly, and that is that Senator Clinton believes the only way to achieve universal health care is to force everybody to purchase it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And my belief is, the reason that people don't have it is not because they don't want it but because they can't afford it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And so I emphasize reducing costs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And as has been noted by many observers, including Bill Clinton's former secretary of labor, my plan does more than anybody to reduce costs, and there is nobody out there who wants health insurance who can't have it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: Now, there are legitimate arguments for why Senator Clinton and others have called for a mandate, and I'm happy to have that debate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But the notion that I am leaving 15 million people out somehow implies that we are different in our goals of providing coverage to all Americans, and that is simply not true. We think that there's going to be a different way of getting there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "One last point I want to make on the health care front. I admire the fact that Senator Clinton tried to bring about health care reform back in 1993. She deserves credit for that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But I said before, I think she did it in the wrong way, because it wasn't just the fact that the insurance companies, the drug companies were battling here, and no doubt they were. It was also that Senator Clinton and the administration went behind closed doors, excluded the participation even of Democratic members of Congress who had slightly different ideas than the ones that Senator Clinton had put forward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And, as a consequence, it was much more difficult to get Congress to cooperate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: And I've said that I'm going to do things differently. I think we have to open up the process. Everybody has to have a seat at the table. And most importantly, the American people have to be involved and educated about how this change is going to be brought about.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The point is this, you know, we can have great plans, but if we don't change how the politics is working in Washington, then neither of our plans are going to happen, and we're going to be four years from now debating once again how we're going to bring universal health care to this country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: All right, we've got some time constraints here, so we've got to take another real quick break. Stay with us. We've got a lot more ahead.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You can compare the candidates on the issues any time; just go to our Web site, Cnnpolitics.com. A lot more ahead here at the University of Texas. We'll be right back.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: An enthusiastic crowd here at the University of Texas.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Welcome back to the Texas Democratic debate. Let's get right to it. Jorge Ramos with the next question.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "RAMOS: Senator Clinton, yesterday you said, and I'm quoting, One of us is ready to be commander in chief.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Are you saying that Senator Obama is not ready and not qualified to be commander in chief?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, I believe that I am ready and I am prepared. And I will leave that to the voters to decide.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But I want to get back to health care, because I didn't get a chance to respond after Senator Obama finished. No, let me finish, Jorge...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "RAMOS: But I would like to come back...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: This is a significant difference. You know, Senator Obama has said it's a philosophical difference. I think it's a substantive difference.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He has a mandate for parents to be sure to ensure their children. I agree with that. I just know that if we don't go and require everyone to have health insurance, the health insurance industry will still game the system. Everyone of us with insurance will pay the hidden tax of approximately $900 a year to make up for the lack of insurance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And you know, in one of our earlier debates, John Edwards made a great point. It would be as though Social Security were voluntary. Medicare, one of the great accomplishments of President Johnson, was voluntary.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I do not believe that is going to work. So it's not just a philosophical difference.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: You look at what will work and what will not work. If you do not have a plan that starts out attempting to achieve universal health care, you will be nibbled to death, and we will be back here with more and more people uninsured and rising costs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: All right. We appreciate that you want to make a point, Senator Obama. We have limited time, so I would like Jorge to move on to another subject or we're going to be out of time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: Well, I understand. But I think that Senator Clinton made a...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You know, she's making a point, and I think I should have the opportunity to respond very briefly. And I'll try to make...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: Number one, understand that when Senator Clinton says a mandate, it's not a mandate on government to provide health insurance, it's a mandate on individuals to purchase it. And Senator Clinton is right; we have to find out what works.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: Now, Massachusetts has a mandate right now. They have exempted 20 percent of the uninsured because they have concluded that that 20 percent can't afford it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In some cases, there are people who are paying fines and still can't afford it, so now they're worse off than they were. They don't have health insurance and they're paying a fine.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In order for you to force people to get health insurance, you've got to have a very harsh penalty, and Senator Clinton has said that we won't go after their wages. Now, this is a substantive difference. But understand that both of us seek to get universal health care. I have a substantive difference with Senator Clinton on how to get there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: Wait a minute, no, this is too important. This is the number one issue that people talk to me about. You know, when a mother grabs my arm and says, I can't get the operation my son needs because I don't have health insurance, it is personal for me.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: And I just fundamentally disagree.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You know, Senator Obama's plan has a mandate on parents and a fine if parents do not...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: Because he recognizes that unless we have some kind of restriction, we will not get there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: He's also said that if people show up at a hospital sick, without health insurance, well, maybe at that point you can fine them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We would not have a social compact with Social Security and Medicare if everyone did not have to participate. I want a universal health care plan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: Now, that's -- that mother -- that mother who is desperate to get health care for her child, will be able to get that health care under my plan. Point number one.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Point number two, the reason a mandate for children can be effective is we've got an ability to make affordable health care available to that child, right now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: There are no excuses. If a parent is not providing health care for that child, it's because the parent's not being responsible, under my plan. And those children don't have a choice. But I think that adults are going to be able to see that they can afford it, under my plan; they will get it, under my plan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And it is true that, if it turns out that some are gaming the system, then we can impose, potentially, some penalties on them for gaming the system.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But the notion that, somehow, I am interested in leaving out 15 million people, without health insurance, is simply not true.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: OK. Jorge -- let's let Jorge re-ask his question, because I don't think anyone remembers that one.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "RAMOS: Let me try again, and not in Spanish, OK?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Here we go again. Because we also believe the war in Iraq is very important.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And here's the question. Are you suggesting that Senator Obama is not ready; he doesn't have the experience to be commander in chief? That's a question of: What did you mean by that phrase?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: What I mean is that, you know, for more than 15 years, I've been honored to represent our country in more than 80 countries to negotiate on matters such as opening borders for refugees during the war in Kosovo, to stand up for women's rights as human rights around the world. I've served on the Senate...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I've served on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I have worked as one of the leaders in the Congress on behalf of Homeland Security in the very difficult challenges we face.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You know, just this week, it's a good example. We had elections in Pakistan, we had change in government in Cuba -- or at least the leadership. We've had the elections that, you know, should have happened that haven't happened and just changed the leader the way they do in Cuba. We've had Kosovo declaring independence, and we have had our embassy set on fire in Serbia.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So we have serious problems that pose a real question about presidential leadership, and also some great opportunities. You know, we now have opportunities perhaps with Cuba, I hope with President Musharraf, for him to do the right thing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: I supported the independence of Kosovo because I think it is imperative that in the heart of Europe we continue to promote independence and democracy. And I would be moving very aggressively to hold the Serbian government responsible with their security forces to protect our embassy. Under international law, they should be doing that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So when you think about everything that is going to happen, what we can predict and what we cannot predict, I believe that I am prepared and ready on day one to be commander in chief, to be the president, to turn our economy around, and to begin making a lot of these very difficult decisions that we will inherit from George Bush. And that is what I am putting forth to the voters.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: I wouldn't be running if I didn't think I was prepared to be commander-in-chief.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "My number one job as president will be to keep the American people safe. I will do whatever is required to accomplish that. I will not hesitate to act against those that would do America harm.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, that involves maintaining the strongest military on earth, which means that we are training our troops properly and equipping them properly, and putting them on proper rotations. And there are an awful lot of families here in Texas who have been burdened under two and three and four tours because of the poor planning of the current commander-in-chief, and that will end when I am president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: But it also means using our military wisely. And on what I believe was the single most important foreign policy decision of this generation, whether or not to go to war in Iraq, I believe I showed the judgment of a commander in chief. And I think that Senator Clinton was wrong in her judgments on that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, that has consequences -- that has significant consequences, because it has diverted attention from Afghanistan where al Qaeda, that killed 3,000 Americans, are stronger now than at any time since 2001.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You know, I've heard from an Army captain who was the head of a rifle platoon -- supposed to have 39 men in a rifle platoon. Ended up being sent to Afghanistan with 24 because 15 of those soldiers had been sent to Iraq.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: And as a consequence, they didn't have enough ammunition, they didn't have enough humvees. They were actually capturing Taliban weapons, because it was easier to get Taliban weapons than it was for them to get properly equipped by our current commander in chief.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, that's a consequence of bad judgment. And you know, the question is, on the critical issues that we face right now, who's going to show the judgment to lead? And I think that on every critical issue that we've seen in foreign policy over the last several years -- going into Iraq originally, I didn't just oppose it for the sake of opposing it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I said this is going to distract us from Afghanistan; this is going to fan the flames of anti-American sentiment; it's going to cost us billions of dollars and thousands of lives and overstretch our military. And I was right.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "On the question of Pakistan, which Senator Clinton just raised -- we just had an election there. But I've said very clearly that we have put all our eggs in the Musharraf basket. That was a mistake. We should be going after al Qaeda and making sure that Pakistan is serious about hunting down terrorists, as well as expanding democracy. And I was right about that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "On the issues that have come up that a commander in chief is going to have to make decisions on, I have shown the judgment to lead. That is the leadership that I want to show when I'm president of the United States.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: On the issues that have come up, that a commander in chief is going to have to make decisions on, I have shown the judgment to lead. That is the leadership that I want to show when I'm president of the United States.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: All right. We're going to stay with this and stay on Iraq.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "KING: I want to continue in this vein, and hone in on the very point you just made. Because one of you, unless this remarkable campaign here takes another wacky, unpredictable turn, is going to be running against a decorated war hero, who is going to say that you don't have the experience to be commander in chief.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And you have both said, it's not about that type of experience; it's about judgment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You both had to make a judgment, a short time ago, in your job in the United States Senate, about whether to support the surge. And as that was going on, Senator Clinton, you had the commanding general in Iraq before you. And you said, I think that the reports provide to us really require the willing suspension of disbelief -- your words to General Petraeus.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "KING: I want you to look at Iraq now and listen to those who say the security situation is better. Ideal, no, but better -- some say significantly, in recent days, even some steps toward a political reconciliation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Is Iraq today better off than it was six months or a year ago because of the surge?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, John, I think you forget a very important premise of the surge. The rationale of the surge was to create the space and time for the Iraqi government to make the decisions that only it can make.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, there is no doubt, given the skill and the commitment of our young men and women in uniform that putting more of them in will give us a tactical advantage and will provide security in some places, and that has occurred.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: But the fact is that the purpose of it has not been fulfilled. The Iraqi government has slowly inched toward making a few of the decisions in a less than complete way, but it hasn't taken advantage of the sacrifice and the losses of life and billions of dollars that have occurred since the surge began.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That is why I have said, upon taking office I would ask the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and my security advisers to give me a plan so that I could begin withdrawing our troops within 60 days.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I would begin that with...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... with a very clear message to the Iraqis that they no longer had a blank check, as they had been given by President Bush, that as we withdraw our troops, probably one to two brigades a month, they would have to step up and make these decisions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: I believe that is in the best interest of our military, which has been stretched thin.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Last night in Brownsville, you know, a woman grabbed my hand and said, Please, my husband's there for the third time. Bring him home.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I told her privately what I have said publicly many times -- I will bring him home because I do not think it is in the interest of America or of the Iraqis that we continue to be there. It is up to the Iraqis to decide the kind of future they will have.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: Senator Obama, in the same vein, you were also opposed to the surge from the beginning. Were you wrong?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: Well, I think it is indisputable that we've seen violence reduced in Iraq. And that's a credit to our brave men and women in uniform.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In fact, you know, the 1st Cavalry, out of Fort Hood, played an enormous role in pushing back al Qaeda out of Baghdad.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: And, you know, we honor their service.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But this is a tactical victory imposed upon a huge strategic blunder.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I think that, when we're having a debate with John McCain, it is going to be much easier for the candidate who was opposed to the concept of invading Iraq in the first place to have a debate about the wisdom of that decision...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... than having to argue about the tactics subsequent to the decision.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Because, ultimately, that's what's at stake. Understand, not only have we been diverted from Afghanistan. We've been diverted from focusing on Latin America.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We contribute -- our entire foreign aid to Latin America is $2.7 billion, approximately what we spend in Iraq in a week.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: And it is any surprise, then, that you've seen people like Hugo Chavez and countries like China move into the void, because we've been neglectful of that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Iran is the single biggest strategic beneficiary of us having invaded Iraq, and that is something that I think John McCain has to come to terms with.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So that is a debate that I'm happy to have.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "One last point I want to make on this, and that is, the incredible burden that has been placed on the American people, starting with military families, and the fact that we still are not doing right by our veterans, that we still don't honor their service, that there are still homeless veterans, that we still don't screen properly for post-traumatic stress disorder and make sure that they're getting mental services that they need, that we are still...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... having veterans in south Texas have to drive 250 miles to access a veterans hospital.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: That's unacceptable. But we talked about the economy earlier, the fact that we're spending $12 billion every month in Iraq means that we can't engage in the kind of infrastructure improvements that are going to make us more competitive. It means that we can't deliver on the kinds of health care reforms that both Senator Clinton and I are looking for.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And that is also an argument that we have to have with John McCain because he has said that he is willing to have these troops over there for 100 years. The notion that we would sustain that kind of effort and neglect not only making us more secure here at home, more competitive here at home, allow our economy to sink. As John McCain says, he doesn't really understand the economy that well. It is clear from his embrace of George Bush's policies that he doesn't, and that's what I intend to change when I am president of the United States of America.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: All right. We've got to take another quick break. We've got a lot more ahead. Stay with us. We'll be right back.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BROWN: Welcome back to the Texas Democratic debate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Stay with us after the debate. Anderson Cooper and the best political team on television will have lots of analysis.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Both of you have been harshly critical of the Bush administration for its secrecy, what you consider overuse of secrecy and executive power.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Tonight, Senator Obama, you've talked about more transparency. You also at one point criticized earmarks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And yet, a recent report came out that identified you -- lower on the list in terms how much money senators seek and sneak into the budget for these pork barrel spending projects, but it still said you were responsible for $91 million in earmarks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And you have refused to say where the money went, what it's for. Why?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: No, that's not true. We've actually disclosed, John, all our earmarks. And so, you know, we'll be happy to provide you with that information, because I believe very strongly in transparency.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: As I indicated earlier, one of the things that I did last year was to pass a bill with Tom Coburn, very conservative Republican but a sincere fiscal conservative. And we got together and created what we call Google for Government. It's a searchable database, where every single dollar of federal spending is posted on the Internet, so that ordinary voters can take a look. And if they see a bridge to nowhere being built, they know where it's going and who sponsored it. And if they see a no-bid contract going to Halliburton, they can check that out, too.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And you know, the idea is that we open up the process so that the American people can make judgments about whether or not government is doing what it's supposed to be doing with its taxpayer money. And I've been consistently in favor of more disclosure around earmarks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: Now, keep in mind, a lot of these are worthy projects in our states. I have actively pursued projects that I think are important. But I want to make sure that they're not done in the dark of night, that they're not done in committee, that everybody stands up and says, this is the kind of spending that I think is important.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I have consistently supported those efforts. I will push for those as president of the United States of America.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "KING: Senator Clinton, as you know, I think your number was about $342 million. You say they're worthy projects, as Senator Obama did, for your state and that's part of your job, to get money for worthy projects back in your state.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Senator McCain, as you know, is proud of going around the country earmark.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "On the specific issue of pork barrel spending, fiscal accountability by the government at a time when many Americans frankly think, whether it is the House or the Senate, that you all waste money on things that aren't important to them, don't affect their daily lives, does he have a better case to make to the American people that, I have done this my entire career; I will do it as president, on the issue of on the issue of wasteful pork barrel spending?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, no, not at all. Because he supported the wasteful tax cuts of the Bush administration and the Iraq war, with the billions of dollars...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "... that have been spent, and wants it to continue.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You know, when President Bush came into office, he inherited a balanced budget and a surplus. And it is gone. And we now are looking at a projected deficit of $400 billion, under the new Bush budget, and a $9 trillion debt.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We borrow money from the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis. That is not a winning strategy for America.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I will get us back to fiscal responsibility. And I will make it clear that the Bush tax cuts on the upper income, those making more than $250,000 a year, will be allowed to expire.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: Middle-class tax cuts and support for the middle class, to make college affordable, retirement security possible, health insurance affordable: Those will be my priorities.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I think it's important that we look at where the money has gone under President Bush -- no-bid contracts, cronyism, outsourcing the government in ways that haven't saved us money and have reduced accountability.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So the larger question is, who really is going to move us toward fiscal responsibility, and I believe that we can get back on the path we were on. It was working well. It was one of the reasons why the economy was booming.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I've got that, you know, clearly in my economic blueprint, which is something that I've published the last few days, because it's part of what we have to do again. And I think that I will be very comfortable and effective in taking on Senator McCain over the fiscal irresponsibility of the Republican Party that he's been a part of.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Lowering your tax bill is always a joy. For most taxpayers, it's fairly easy to trim down your tax liability without breaking the rules (and therefore inviting some truly nasty penalties down the road).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The simplest way to manage this feat is to reduce your taxable income. That doesn't mean asking your boss for a pay cut -- rather, the idea is to make part of your income exempt from taxation. This strategy really shines when it can drop you into a lower tax bracket, because not only will you pay less in taxes, but you'll also reduce your tax rate for part of your income.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You've probably seen those tax charts with the income ranges on one side and a series of percentages -- 10%, 15%, 25%, etc. -- on the other side. Many people jump to the conclusion that having an income in a particular range means all of their income is taxed at that bracket's rate. Actually, tax brackets are marginal, rather than absolute. That means only the part of your income within each range is taxed at the corresponding tax rate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Take a look at this 2017 tax bracket report to get an idea of what that means. If your filing status is single, and you made $50,000 in 2017, then the first $9,325 of your income would be taxed at a 10% rate (in other words, you'd owe $932.50 in taxes on that chunk of income). Your income between $9,325 and $37,950 would be taxed at a 15% rate, and the rest of your income for the year would be taxed at a 25% rate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In this example, the income that the IRS hits the hardest is the bit above $37,950. But if you could turn all your income above $37,950 into nontaxable income, then the IRS would keep its hands off everything in the 25% tax bracket, and your top tax rate for the year would be 15% -- a much nicer number.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So if you wanted to drop into a lower tax bracket, your goal for 2017 would be to get at least $12,050 (that's $50,000 minus $37,950) of your income declared off-limits for tax purposes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The IRS actually provides quite a few ways to transform taxable income into nontaxable income. They're called deductions. Yes, that's what a deduction really is -- a way to flag a piece of income as nontaxable. It's how the federal government rewards you for spending money in ways that it deems beneficial to society.

But your income likely would be $5 less as a result. You'd still end up with the same $95 either way. And your employer's costs would still be $100 but your company could deduct the $5, since the payroll tax is a deductible employer expense.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Millions of Americans have tax time bombs lurking among their assets. Often, it's a smart strategy to put these investments to good use, as long as you don't forget about their potential downsides.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Here are three of the most common tax time bombs that you'll find and what you can do to keep them from doing irreparable damage to your finances.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "1. Traditional IRAs and qualified retirement plan accounts", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Perhaps the largest ticking time bomb from a tax perspective comes from the money that Americans have in IRAs, 401(k) plans, and other qualified retirement plans. 401(k)s have about $5.3 trillion in assets, according to the Investment Company Institute, and total retirement assets amount to $27.2 trillion. That second number includes annuities and traditional pensions, and both figures consist of both traditional and Roth-style IRAs and 401(k) plans. Nevertheless, it's fair to assume that there's somewhere between $10 trillion and $20 trillion in pre-tax assets held in retirement plans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The problem with traditional IRAs, 401(k)s, and similar retirement accounts is that when you withdraw money from them, you have to pay income tax on what you pull out, and that reduces the size of your effective after-tax nest egg.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Even if you don't want to withdraw your pre-tax retirement money, these accounts are almost universally subject to required minimum distribution rules that kick in at age 70 1/2. Once you reach that age, you have no choice: You must start withdrawing a portion of your account and paying taxes on it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What's more, the withdrawals you have to include in taxable income can subject other sources of income to tax. The most common example is Social Security, where benefits become taxable if your outside income lifts you over certain threshold amounts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "One solution is to make greater use of Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k) plan options. Roth accounts let you save after-tax money, with distributions being tax-free in retirement. Not all employers offer Roth 401(k)s, but conversions of existing traditional retirement assets to Roths are generally available.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Many people own savings bonds without even knowing it. As popular gifts from older generations to children, savings bonds differ from most bonds in that they accumulate interest on a tax-deferred basis. You don't have to pay taxes on the income that they generate each year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The price you'll pay, though, is that you have to pay tax when you cash in your bonds. Because currently issued savings bonds stop earning interest after 30 years, you either have to cash them in and suffer the tax consequences or allow them to sit without earning any interest at all after their final maturity date.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Fortunately, one solution is to take the money from maturing bonds and transfer it into a 529 college savings plan account. Doing so lets you exclude the accumulated interest from taxation. Otherwise, you'll have to pay tax on the entire increase in value from what you paid for the bond and what you received when you cashed it in.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Finally, your personal residence can be a ticking tax time bomb. Most homeowners get the benefit of one of the most lucrative tax breaks on the books: the capital gains exclusion of up to $250,000 for singles or $500,000 for joint filers. What that means is that if a couple saw their home rise in value from $300,000 to $800,000 over their lifetimes, they can sell it and pay no tax at all.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So how is this a tax trap? The potential problem is that the exclusion is available only for property that's been used as your principal residence during at least two of the five years preceding the sale. There are special rules that reduce that requirement to just one year if you need to leave your home for long-term care in a nursing home or other institution, but failing to meet the requirement can eliminate the exclusion entirely. Moreover, if you decide to change the nature of the home to a nonqualified use -- such as renting it out -- then capital gain that's attributed to the period of nonqualified use can be taxable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The solution is to sell your home long before there's any danger of losing the personal residence exclusion. Otherwise, you could turn the most profitable investment of your life into a major tax hassle.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "(CNN) President-elect Joe Biden is inheriting a national crisis that has built up over 40 years. On January 20, 1981, former President Ronald Reagan took the US on a radical course when he declared in his inaugural address , In the present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. He set out to weaken the federal government by slashing taxes on the rich, dismantling regulations , cutting back on public programs and turning many of the nation's problems back to the states.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Reagan won the presidency in 1980, in part, because of two actions by Democratic presidents that had brought an end to the national consensus in favor of activist government that began with Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal of the 1930s and lasted through the 1960s.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The first action that ended the consensus was profoundly moral. Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B.

They did so in the face of intense opposition by segregationist Southern Democrats -- and knowing that their actions could split their own party.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The result was a furious backlash of White working-class voters that swept Richard Nixon into office in 1968 with the help of the  Southern Strategy,  a new Republican strategy to court disgruntled Southern White voters. These White voters thereafter strongly supported politicians like Nixon and Reagan who promised to cutback the enforcement powers of the federal government and stop federal programs on jobs, housing and community development that would undermine continued segregation at the local level.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "The second action was profoundly immoral. Johnson escalated the Vietnam War even though he knew the war was conducted on the basis of lies and deception . Johnson's decision was also politically disastrous because the war spending ramped up inflation and bitterly divided the nation. During his first term, Nixon further escalated the war and the inflation and unleashed years of monetary instability that lasted through the presidency of Jimmy Carter. When inflation reach 13.5% in 1980, Carter was defeated by Reagan in November that year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Reagan claimed that he wanted to stop deficit spending, but his 1981 tax cuts increased the deficits (from 2.5% of GDP in 1981 to 5.9% of GDP in 1983), as did the 2001 tax cut under former President George W. Bush and the 2017 tax cut under Trump. Over time, the various tax cuts were not matched by offsetting spending cuts, since broad areas of federal spending were -- and continue to be -- very strongly backed by the public. In fact, according to the Pew Research Center, in 2019, there were strong majorities supporting increased government spending on many domestic priorities, including education, infrastructure and the environment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The result has been a massive buildup of federal government debt, which was also stoked by the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. The federal debt owed to the public was 25% of GDP when Reagan took office. It was around 98% of GDP at the end of 2020, and will likely soar further because of further urgent spending related to Covid-19.", "augmented": []}

The wealthy funders of both parties -- Wall Street financiers, big oilmen, Silicon Valley gurus, real estate developers, private-prison owners, etc. -- couldn't believe their good fortunes in receiving repeated tax breaks and even the deregulation of their polluting activities. The rich got richer year after year, while working class Whites and African Americans, social conservatives and social liberals, evangelicals and atheists, waged the pitched battle for the nation's soul.", "augmented": []}

Student debts are $1.68 trillion , owed by an astounding 44.7 million borrowers.

{"original": "After all, we're already woefully behind on our retirement savings — according to a recent study by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies, the median Millennial household only has $37,000 in retirement savings, and the median Baby Boomer household only has $164,000. Raiding your 401(k) fund has the effect of making that situation worse.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Nonetheless, every now and then, a situation crops up where taking out a 401(k) loan may be the least worst option. Here are two.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Of the roughly 29% of Americans who report having taken some kind of early withdrawal or loan from their retirement plan, over half report having done so to pay off credit card debt. The average credit card charges a roughly 12.5% annual interest rate, and the average American household has $7,136 in credit card debt.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The average 401(k) loan, by contrast, usually charges an interest rate a percentage point or two above the prime rate — currently at 4.5%, so assume 6% or so. Even though withdrawing the money means you miss out on the potential compounding of that money in the stock market — historically speaking, between 6% and 7% after inflation — you can see that it's basically a wash between slowly chipping away at a credit card at 12.5% APR versus paying it off in one fell swoop with a 401(k) loan. Plus, the interest you pay on your 401(k) loan is deposited into your 401(k) — so at least those interest payments are going to you and not the bank.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Paying off credit card debt with a 401(k) loan still isn't a good option, but if you're caught in a spiral of high-interest credit card debt that you'll struggle to pay off (perhaps a scenario in which you have twice the average household credit card debt), a 401(k) loan could give you the ability to do a needed reset if you aren't able to take advantage of other, better debt consolidation strategies. You would still have to pay all of the money back with after-tax dollars (meaning that you'd lose out on one of the key benefits to the 401(k) — its tax-deferred status), and if you exit your job, you may be forced to pay the entire balance back immediately. Taking out a loan on your 401(k) isn't an attractive strategy, but it may make sense if you're in a tough spot.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The IRS specifies the circumstances under which a 401(k) provider may (but is not required to) allow for hardship withdrawals by noting that they could be allowed when there is an immediate and heavy financial need of the employee — and the amount withdrawn must be necessary to satisfy the financial need. Put a different way, you have to need money quickly, and there must be no other way you can get that money.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "To clarify just how up against a wall you have to be to qualify, the IRS further stipulates that you must have already tapped all other currently available distributions and loans under the plan and all other plans maintained by the employer — meaning you have to have already taken out the maximum possible 401(k) loan (which is the lesser of 50% of the vested balance or $50,000).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This should be the true last resort, and not just because it's required by tax law. The money you withdraw for financial hardship is fully taxed and may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty. The money may also not be paid back to your 401(k) (unlike in the 401(k) loan example above), and you will be barred from contributing to the 401(k) plan for six months.

Long-term investors know they don't have to pay capital gains on stock positions until they sell them, providing a lot of control over tax costs.

{"original": "There are ways to smooth out your taxable income so that you don't miss out on tax-saving opportunities. When taxable income is high, make greater contributions to retirement accounts that give you deductions. When it's low, consider selling investments at a gain or converting traditional retirement accounts to Roth accounts. Both of these things will raise your taxable income, but when low tax rates prevail, it's often smarter to pay lower tax now rather than higher tax at some point in the future.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "(CNN) -- The presidency of the United States hinged on fewer than 1,000 votes in Florida early today, as what may be the closest presidential race in American history kept either Texas Gov. George W. Bush or Vice President Al Gore from declaring victory. The latest CNN vote count gave Bush a lead of only 926 votes in Florida, a margin well within the one-half of one percent that triggers a recount under state law. Gore, meanwhile, led the popular vote nationwide by slightly more than 60,000 votes out of 94 million-plus ballots cast. Shortly after 2 a.m. EST, CNN and other news organizations projected Bush the winner in Florida, with its 25 electoral votes taking his total to 271 -- one more than the 270 needed to win a majority in the Electoral College. But questions about the Florida count prompted the networks to place Florida back in the too close to call category, leaving Bush with only 246. In this story:", "augmented": []}

{"original": "We hope and believe we have elected the next president of the United States, Bush campaign chairman Don Evans said about 4:30 a.m. EST. The latest count in the state of Florida shows Gov. Bush winning that state by more than 1,200 votes. They're still counting. They're still counting, and I'm confident when all is said and done, we will prevail. Gore was projected to have 249 electoral votes, with at least two states -- Oregon and Wisconsin -- remaining too close to call this morning. CNN's count of the race showed Bush had received 2,905,033 votes in Florida; Gore had 2,904,107. I would caution both candidates not to make any definitive statements, Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth said in a statement issued early today. CNN's Jeff Greenfield reported that Butterworth, a Democrat who served as Gore's campaign chairman in Florida, called Gore and told him to put off a concession speech until a recount could be performed. Butterworth promised the recount would be done in a relatively short period of time, but said county election supervisors should give their poll workers a chance to rest first. We owe this to the people of this country, because we're talkng about one vote for every five or six precincts in this state, he said. With thousands of Gore supporters standing in the predawn rain in Nashville, Tennessee, campaign chairman William Daley announced Gore would not yet concede the race.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Without being certain of the results in Florida, we simply cannot be certain of the results of the national election, Daley announced shortly after 4 a.m. EST. Gore already had called Bush to congratulate him on his win, when the tightening numbers in Florida prompted him to call again and retract those comments. Daley said Gore and his running mate, Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, were prepared to concede and support Bush if he is officially elected. But this race is simply too close to call, and until the recount is concluded and the results in Florida become official, our campaign continues, Daley said as the crowd roared its approval. Daley said about 5,000 votes remained to be counted in Florida in addition to a recount. I've been in politics a long time, and I don't think there's ever been a night like this one, Daley said. Meanwhile, in the nationwide popular vote, with 97 percent of precincts in, Gore led Bush by 49 to 48 percent. Gore had collected 47,744,437 votes across the country, while Bush had 47,480,638, according to CNN's count. The white-knuckle race appeared to lean Gore's way early in the night, as news organizations projected Gore the winner in Florida based on exit polling. Along with Gore victories in Pennsylvania, Michigan, New York and Illinois, that gave the vice president a large lead in the Electoral College count.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But Bush took a lead in early returns in Florida, and the news organizations that had called Florida for Gore -- including CNN -- quickly switched it back to a toss-up. Watching the returns with his wife and parents, former President George Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush, the GOP nominee said he was not prepared to concede major Eastern states that exit polls indicated were leaning to Gore -- including Pennsylvania and Florida. Both states are led by Republican governors, including the nominee's brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The networks are calling this thing awfully early, but the people counting the votes have a different perspective, the Texas governor said. By 1 a.m., it became clear that both men needed to win Florida to claim the White House -- and about two-thirds of the votes remaining to be counted in Florida came from the Democratic bastions of south Florida, in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas. Late into the night, Gore's deputy campaign manager Mark Fabiani still held out hope of a victory. Bush is slightly ahead now, but that's because the Democratic strongholds in the state -- Dade County and Broward County -- have not had their votes counted yet, Fabiani said. Both campaigns had scrambled to turn out the vote, not only in major states in the Electoral College, but in smaller states where the races were expected to be tight.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Heavy turnout in St. Louis, a Democratic stronghold in the battleground state of Missouri, prompted a judge to extend polling there by three hours. He was overruled later by a state appellate judge after Republicans appealed the decision. An official in the New York borough of Manhattan said he was calling in more volunteers to get help because turnout was greater than he had expected. In the Atlanta, Georgia, area, voters waited as long as three hours to enter voting booths. In the Chicago suburb of Lake Forest, Illinois, poll workers reported the turnout was much better than anything we've seen before. Gore's campaign deployed the Rev. Jesse Jackson in Pennsylvania on Tuesday afternoon and called on Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy's organization to send volunteers to New Hampshire for get-out-the-vote efforts there. I believe we have the best ground troops in America knocking on doors, getting on phones for Gore, Donna Brazile, the vice president's campaign manager, said Tuesday evening. The Gore campaign estimated that it put about 50,000 volunteers into the field during the campaign, sent 50 million pieces of direct mail, made 40 million phone calls and sent 30 million pieces of e-mail by the time polls closed Tuesday. Bush strategist Karl Rove said Monday the Bush campaign sent as many as 243,000 volunteers onto the streets in 28 battleground states, making up to 70 million phone calls and sending out 110 million pieces of mail.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The last days Gore wound up a 30-hour final blitz of campaign stops in Florida before flying home to Tennessee early Tuesday. Al and Tipper Gore voted at a school in Elmwood, near their home in Carthage, before the vice president gave fifth-grade students a civics lesson on the importance of voting. I voted for my husband Al Gore and it was a thrill, Tipper Gore said after casting her ballot. It was wonderful. It was very exciting. Bush voted Tuesday in Austin, telling reporters, We had a long day yesterday, but I feel great. I've been making some phone calls this morning, he said. I've called my parents first thing when I woke up to assure them that I'm feeling pretty good about it ... that we've done all we can do, and it's up to the people of the country to make up their mind. Both candidates spent their last day of campaigning hammering home themes they stressed throughout the past year and a half on the stump. Gore cast the election as a referendum on the prosperity of the past few years, warning that Bush's plans for a $1 trillion-plus tax cut would undercut the foundations of the economic boom.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He criticized Bush's proposal to partially privatize Social Security, saying Bush has promised about $1 trillion from the Social Security Trust Fund to two groups of people: younger workers, who would be allowed to privately invest a share of their payroll taxes; and older Americans who need that money to pay current benefits. Gore promised to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, the federal medical insurance program for seniors --- and he has tried to cast doubts upon the Texas governor's ability to handle the complexities of the job. Gore and President Clinton credited their administration's eight-year federal budgeting strategy for turning the recession of the early 1990s into an atmosphere that has brought about the balanced budget agreement, some 22 million new jobs, and low rates of unemployment in most regions of the country. Bush -- whose father was ousted by Clinton in 1992 in the wake of the last national economic downturn -- argues that though the economy has shown improvement since his father left office, the reasons have little -- to nothing at all -- to do with Gore or Clinton. But with voters unlikely to want broad economic reforms, Bush chose instead to focus on other sensitive areas for overhaul. Those include the public education system; the armed forces; the 35-year-old Medicare health insurance program; and Social Security.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Bush also called for a new era of responsibility in Washington and promised to ease the partisan rancor that has characterized much of American politics in recent years, citing his ability to work with legislators on both sides of the aisle in Texas. And he included a call to restore honor to the White House in nearly every campaign appearance -- a not-so-subtle reference to Clinton's affair with a former White House intern, which led to his 1998 impeachment and acquittal by the Senate the following year. Third parties seek to influence future races While Bush and Gore sprinted around the country hoping to secure the winning margin in the upper Midwest and along the East Coast, minor-party candidates Nader and Pat Buchanan vowed their movements would remain active into the next election cycle. Gore had to spend more time and money in some states that normally would be considered reliably Democratic because of Green Party candidate Nader's challenge from his left. Democrats worried a strong turnout for Nader -- he ended up with about 2.4 million votes, or 3 percent nationwide -- could take votes from Gore and throw the election to Bush. The Greens failed to get the 5 percent of the popular vote they need to qualify for federal matching funds in the 2004 presidential race, but Nader declared the night a win for the party anyway. We're coming out of this election with millions of votes -- with the third-largest political party in America, replacing the Reform Party, he said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We become a viable watchdog party on the two parties, telling them they need to shape up or they're going to lose votes in the future. Meanwhile, Reform Party candidate Buchanan -- who secured $12.6 million in federal matching funds after the party's raucous convention in August -- said Monday he would be around to serve as a conservative watchdog over a Republican administration. Buchanan earned less than 1 percent of the popular vote after inheriting the mantle of Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who won 8 percent in 1996 and 19 percent in 1992. Buchanan had challenged Bush's father in the 1992 Republican primaries. Asked about the likelihood of a Bush win, Buchanan said, If there is another Bush in the White House, there will be another Buchanan watchdog right outside the White House.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you earn money, whether in the form of wages, interest, or even gambling winnings, among other things, you are required to pay taxes on that money. And there are very few exceptions to those tax laws.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But one particular exception to that rule stands out: The tax treatment of earnings within a Roth IRA. And that special tax treatment leads to four reasons you should love saving for retirement in a Roth account.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In general, when you contribute to a traditional IRA, you do so on a pre-tax basis. Your money then has the advantage of being able to grow tax-deferred. But it's important to remember that when you withdraw that money -- consisting of both principal and earnings -- you will owe ordinary income taxes on your distributions. And when you are in retirement and no longer bringing in income, you will be responsible for paying those taxes either from your retirement accounts or from other sources of funds.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "However, with a Roth IRA, the money you contribute into the account has already been taxed. Then, as long as you follow some basic account requirements, including having a Roth account open for at least five years, everything you earn within the account will grow tax-free and remain tax-free even when you take a distribution. So, if you put in $5 and it grows to $10 -- that $5 of growth is yours, tax-free.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "No one knows what the tax rates will be in the future, nor do we know what tax bracket we will be in when we retire. What we do know is the current tax rate and our current tax bracket. And if you save in a Roth today, you generally don't need to worry about future taxes. Whatever you have saved in your Roth IRA will be yours, free and clear.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "2. You can leave your Roth untouched throughout your lifetime", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In order to encourage individuals to save for retirement, the government allows us to save in tax-favored retirement accounts. But it won't let you avoid paying taxes on your savings forever.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For traditional IRAs and 401(k) accounts, at age 70 1/2, you typically must begin taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your tax-deferred accounts, at which time you will owe ordinary income taxes. And since you are required to begin drawing down your accounts, you are no longer able to continue contributing money into traditional IRAs past age 70 1/2.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "However, these requirements do not apply to the Roth IRA. In fact, you are never required to take distributions from your Roth. Also, you can continue contributing to your account as long as you have taxable compensation, even past age 70 1/2. Ultimately, that allows you to keep your account untouched and intact for your entire lifetime. Which leads us to the next point.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "3. You can pass tax-free money to heirs", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Another special feature of the Roth IRA is that you can pass the tax-free benefits of the account to your heirs. Like other retirement accounts, if your spouse inherits your Roth IRA, they can treat the account as if it were their own. Therefore, they can continue holding the Roth and are not required to take distributions from it during their lifetime either, thereby allowing it to grow tax-free for even longer if they wish.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you leave your Roth IRA to someone other than a spouse (and you've had the account open for the required five-year period), then that beneficiary can also enjoy tax-free withdrawals -- however, one note of difference is that they will be required to take minimum distributions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Because contributions to a Roth IRA are made with money that has already been taxed, of course, original contributions are always accessible on a tax-free and penalty-free basis. (Again, see here to learn about when your earnings will also be tax-free and penalty-free.) Keep in mind, though, that this money should be earmarked for your future retirement and should only be used as a last resort in case of a true emergency.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Beyond mortgage interest, rent and utility payments, the loan now may be used to cover the costs of personal protective equipment and other expenses incurred to meet Covid restrictions, as well as certain operations, property damage and supplier costs.", "augmented": []}

In order to have a PPP loan forgiven, businesses that borrowed $150,000 or less will simply need to submit a one-page certification that includes the number of employees the business retained as a result of the loan, an estimate of how much of the loan was spent on payroll and the total loan amount. Borrowers must also attest that the information is accurate and that they complied with loan requirements.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "The charge that Zionists and Nazis were in cahoots is not new. Holocaust deniers, anti-Israel extremists, and neo-Nazis, but generally not MPs, have long made it. They insist that Zionists and Nazis shared a goal of a Jew-free Europe and a Jewish homeland.

{"original": "04:11 - Source: CNN Israel marks Holocaust Remembrance Day", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This accusation is ludicrous in its historical inaccuracy. Hitler considered a Jewish homeland a threat to humanity. The Nazis believed that the Jews did not need a state, because they were more powerful than any state; the Zionists believed that the Jews needed a state, because they were powerless without one.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It is also completely historically wrong to argue, as Livingstone did, that until Hitler went mad, he was a compatriot of the Jews. Already in Mein Kampf, published in 1925 before he became chancellor in 1933, he warned of a Jewish virus, described Jews as vile and a pestilence, and called for their expulsion from society.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "From the outset of the Third Reich under Hitler's leadership, Germany made life difficult for Jews. They were forced out of jobs, physically harassed, and expelled from universities. Their stores were boycotted. Jewish schoolchildren were humiliated. In 1935 the Nuremberg Laws deprived Jews of their citizenship. A relentless propaganda campaign reinforced these legal maneuvers: posters, cartoons, children's books, and newspaper articles depicted Jews as Germany and the world's misfortune.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "03:33 - Source: CNN A Holocaust survivor bears witness at trials in Germany", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In Livingstone's case, he has distorted the fact that in August 1933, German Zionists, desperate to help Jews get out of the Reich, concluded the Ha'avara or Transfer agreement, the only formal contract between Nazi Germany and a Zionist organization. Under its provisions, Jews, after paying an increasingly debilitating emigration tax, could deposit a sum of money with the Zionist organization and then, upon arrival in Palestine, use credit on those funds to buy property.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The agreement was of tremendous financial benefit to the Germans, because under the agreement Jewish emigrants often had to forfeit many of their possessions before leaving the country. And it was hardly a negotiation between equals. There was no finding of common ground. The Nazis held the power and the Jews only had ideas to try to blunt the assault directed at them. While no Jews celebrated this interaction with the Nazis, it nonetheless saved approximately 60,000 lives.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So Livingstone credits his knowledge to a book by an American Marxist that is so far outside the historical mainstream as to be dismissed as irrelevant by virtually all Holocaust scholars. The book contends that the Nazis and the Zionists worked in collaboration with one another and that, therefore, Israel has its roots in Nazism with all its attendant evils. One of the few entities to embrace it is the Institute for Historical Review, the home of Holocaust denial activities in the United States.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's important to note, though, that Livingstone isn't an edge case; his comments are indicative of a broader assault on history that has a contemporary objective: to tarnish the reputations of German Jews and Zionists alike. Today, when Hitler and Nazism are two of the remaining terms about which there is a general sense of opprobrium, to claim that the Zionists worked with the Nazis or, in Livingstone's terms, that Hitler was a Zionist and wanted Jews to go to Israel, which did not even exist at the time, is to link the terms Zionism and Israel with Hitler and Nazism and to generate disgust by association.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Lenni Brenner, the author of Zionism in the Age of the Dictators, the book to which Livingstone credits all his knowledge on the topic, and these other critics from the left are suggesting that no truly ethical or moral entity would ever have considered cooperating with Hitler.

{"original": "The current Collective Bargaining Agreement was agreed to in November 2016. One of the chief issues since has been the $197 million competitive balance tax (better known as luxury tax) on each club's payroll that this winter effectively acted as a salary cap. Clubs exceeding $197 million for three or more seasons are subject to a 50 percent payroll tax, as opposed to 20 percent (for exceeding it for one year) or 30 percent (for exceeding it a second year). That's no small part of the reason stars such as Eric Hosmer (Padres), J.D.

Hardy remain unsigned even after Opening Day.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "One of the biggest criticisms of the players union is that while it negotiated increases to the payroll threshold, they weren't enough. From 2014-16, the CBT threshold on player payrolls was $189 million. The current CBA calls for increases over each of the next five years to an eventual $210 million in 2021.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "First instituted in 2003, the CBT is an attempt to level the playing field—at least to a degree—between smaller-market clubs and Goliaths like the Yankees, Dodgers and Red Sox. But with MLB revenues reaching record proportions of more than $10 billion in 2017, there are those who believe the gap between the CBT threshold and each club's individual record revenues has become so great that clubs now are incentivized to protect their record revenues—from TV rights, sponsorships, etc.—in no small part because the threshold is too low.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Obviously, you want the threshold as high as it can be, Clark said. The CBT has been around for 20 years. We know there are some teams that historically respond to it one way, and we know there have been other teams that have responded to it a completely different way. And we know the vast majority of the league is not affected by it because they're not close enough to it.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "It's one thing not to look to sign a number of guys, Clark said.

{"original": "He was the handpicked choice of his predecessor, Michael Weiner, who died in November 2013, following a protracted battle with brain cancer. Weiner was an attorney, as was Don Fehr, the union boss from 1985-2009. Before them, the first head of the players' union, starting in 1966, was Marvin Miller, who was an economist for the International Association of Machinists, United Auto Workers and United Steelworkers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For Clark, accepting Weiner's offer was the culmination of two decades of involvement in union labor issues. He started as the Detroit Tigers' player representative in 1997, just his second full season in the majors. His interest was piqued when he spent a full day at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, when he was in the Class A New York-Penn League in the early 1990s. He spent most of his time that day in the Negro Leagues area of the museum, which, he said, helped me understand, as a black player, the opportunity I had and the responsibility that I had.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Lines between management and labor were clear when Clark came up as a young player: The 1994-95 strike at the time was the fifth work stoppage in 22 years, and it was the mother of them all, lasting 232 days, longest in MLB history. Clark debuted as a rookie for the Tigers late in the '95 season after the players came back earlier that spring.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "It is the players, he emphasized, who drive the strategies. It is their union. His job simply is to understand their disposition on the issues and make judgments accordingly. And as Clark made the rounds this spring, he sensed strengthening resolve from a new generation of players who are fed up with what they view as the owners' duplicity following a long era of peace.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Frustrated as some players are, some of the rhetoric is a little—or a lot—overheated.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For one thing, because players are in the middle of a negotiated contract, it is illegal for them to strike. That would have to wait until the current agreement expires after the '21 season.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Another is the idea that, in the last talks, the union fumbled some key issues such as payroll tax thresholds and compensatory draft picks tied to free agency to win luxury items such as extra seats on the team bus and a chef in every clubhouse. While it is true that the players wanted—and ultimately won—the bus and chef items, the union says that to portray negotiating away the big stuff in exchange for those luxury items is absurd.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's one of the most ridiculous things I heard all offseason, Clark said. Sure, there are things that didn't exist before [such as the chefs]. But it did not come at the expense of not paying attention to the other pieces. Any number of folks are going to look at any number of items differently.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Those who are trying to keep score likely haven't been in a bargaining room.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Ideally, we want everybody to get to free agency earlier and we want the competitive balance tax to be incredibly high, Andrew Miller, the Cleveland reliever and a key union figure as an association representative, said. But the reality is you have to negotiate these things and find a way to make them work for you. The game is in a really good place, and the agreement didn't actually change that much from 2011 to 2016.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "As for the luxury items criticism, Miller said: Players get engaged in that because it's something we know and can relate to. The reality is, a lot of the big stuff, we trust economists and lawyers on that. They drive that conversation. Certainly, players are engaged in on-field issues, whether it's pace of play, things to do with uniforms, things we understand.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Several players and even a few union officials recalled former Commissioner Bud Selig's mantra, that all MLB markets should contain hope and faith heading into each Opening Day. While that always was a naive goal (see: Cleveland, from about 1969-93, among many other clubs), never before has the game seen this sort of behavior by so many clubs looking long term instead of short term.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Everything about the CBA is grounded in the ability for teams to compete every year, Clark said. Whether it's revenue sharing, how those dollars are distributed, the flexibility in the system on how to use those dollars, it was always done against the backdrop of each team doing everything it can with the resources it has to put itself in a position to be the last team standing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When there are professed interests by upwards of a third of the clubs [to rebuild instead of compete in 2018], if some of what we're seeing and hearing is to be believed, that's a concern. It's a concern because we all have a vested interest in the excitement around Opening Day, around the excitement, around the possibilities that exist because the ball does bounce funny ways sometimes. And so when that many teams say, intimate or suggest a salary dump, you just hope there isn't an adverse effect on the industry as a whole.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Said Miller: It's easy to see why these organizations want to copy what the Cubs and Astros did. I don't think either side, players or owners, ever thought in the offseason of 2017-2018 it would be acceptable to the fans to tank. But now it's not hard to go read a message board or look at comments on FanGraphs or TradeRumors when the Pirates or Rays start dumping guys and seeing that people are OK with rebuilds. … I don't think we saw that coming, and it needs to be addressed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A big test will come next winter when high-impact free agents Bryce Harper, Manny Machado, Josh Donaldson and others—Clayton Kershaw, if he opts out of his contract—come onto the market. It is possible that the Yankees, Dodgers and others sat out this winter's free-agent market in anticipation of that. And it's among the reasons Cleveland's Miller said he is taking a bigger-picture view than many others.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Free agency is supposed to be a reward for players who have paid their dues, and it didn't work this year. That does not mean this deal is bad or irredeemable.

Things aren't always going to be sunshine and rainbows. … We have to find a way to get through all this, and I think he's the right guy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Clark, who took the position over several other opportunities within the game—broadcasting, coaching, managing and front office work—said he made this move because he felt it would connect him to former, current and future fraternity members. There was no other job or opportunity that provided that significant a touch point for the group that I was most concerned about or believed in the most.", "augmented": []}

The back window is also made from interesting curved glass with a sunken channel running down the middle. It's an interesting look, but with the downside that the Prius Prime doesn't have a rear wiper like other hatchbacks. The dip in the center makes that window un-wipable.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Forbes pulls the plug after five years, bows out of GOP presidential race Millionaire publisher heads back to 'Forbes' magazine By Ian Christopher McCaleb/CNN WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Steve Forbes traded in the keys of his presidential campaign bus on Thursday for a return trip to his editing desk at 'Forbes' magazine, by opting to end his self-financed, five year-tenure as a Republican presidential candidate. At an appearance in Washington, Forbes made the expected announcement that he would abandon his GOP presidential bid. As my father once said when he lost a governor's race in New Jersey: 'We were nosed out by a landslide,' quipped Forbes, who was flanked by his wife Sabina, two of his five daughters, national campaign manager Ken Blackwell, and Georgia Republican Rep. Bob Barr, a staunch supporter. I have no regrets, and you shouldn't either, Forbes told the boisterous group of supporters that attended his departure announcement at a Washington hotel. I am withdrawing from the presidential contest but I am not withdrawing from the public square, Forbes said, adding after being pressed by reporters that he plans, for the time being, to return to 'Forbes' magazine, where he is chief executive officer and editor-in-chief. I will be going back to 'Forbes' magazine, he said. As a matter of fact, tomorrow I have to write some editorials. Deadlines are deadlines. Forbes did say, however, that he has not ruled out running for elective office at a later date. I'm not ruling anything out, he said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The well-heeled publishing heir, who poured an estimated $66 million of his personal fortune into the 1996 and 2000 presidential races, decided to toss in the towel on his 2000 bid after a disastrous third-place showing in Tuesday's Delaware GOP primary. His departure from the race essentially narrows the Republican field of hopefuls to two -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who won Delaware with 51 percent of the vote, and Arizona Sen. John McCain. Talk show host Alan Keyes still stands as a candidate, but his ability to make a dent in the support accorded to Bush and McCain seems questionable at best. Standing by an earlier guarantee, Forbes refused to endorse any of the three Republicans left in the race for the 2000 nomination, though he threw each measured compliments throughout his news conference. John McCain, Gov. Bush and Alan Keyes are good people, he said. I've gotten to know them. ... But endorsements have become a debased currency in the presidential arena. What I need to do now is wind down my campaign. An endorsement, if I make one, may come in a few weeks. Forbes credited his 2000 campaign, which in effect was launched with the end of his 1996 candidacy, with elevating the dialogue among the full Republican field -- which stood at 10 some months ago, before being whittled down to three by Thursday. Our new conservative agenda will come to pass, mark my words, he said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Among the issues he raised to prominence, Forbes insisted, were tax reform; abortion; fair, equitable treatment of those serving in the military and proper benefit distribution to veterans; school choice; greater consumer latitude in dealing with health insurance companies; and the ability of every American to manipulate their Social Security retirement funds as they see fit. Who will now pick up the banner of freedom and march to victory this year, I do not know, Forbes said. The beginning of the end Forbes, who had been in Michigan for a series of campaign events, canceled those appearances Wednesday and flew home to New Jersey to huddle with his family and his campaign advisors after his unexpected third-place showing in Delaware. His defeat there, where he enjoys high name recognition -- he won the state's primary in 1996 -- and where he campaigned vigorously in the course of the last week, solidified a decision to withdraw that Forbes had reportedly bandied about since last weekend. After not winning there (this year), I had to ask myself if we could make this thing work, he said Thursday. With reluctance, I had to decide that the opportunity did just not appear to be there. To stay in the race any longer, Forbes continued, would be to do damage to the party, because (the press) would focus on things like, 'when is he going to get out.'", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Forbes burst on the political scene with his radical, 17 percent flat-tax proposal in 1996, and a series of negative ads that wounded the eventual Republican nominee, former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole. But Forbes failed to expand his base or organize in key states, and his candidacy failed. With the end of the 1996 presidential election cycle, Forbes opted to begin his 2000 effort with a few new twists, long before Republican establishment favorite Bush and the dark horse McCain tipped their hands and made their intentions to run known. The publishing heir -- chided from all sides for his background of privilege during the 1996 race -- first moved to retool his campaign operation by building his organization from local offices on up to provide a more grass roots feel. As the 2000 campaign heated up, Forbes chose to look past trends showing that many Republican voters were adopting a moderate lean, and while promoting his flat tax plan, he sharpened his social agenda to include calls against legalized abortion, as well as a series of so-called pro-family, morally based pronouncements. But the conservative voting bloc Forbes hoped to appeal to was split by a crowded field of right-leaning candidates that included Keyes, Gary Bauer and Sen. Orrin Hatch. The latter two men have left the race. The messenger may have gotten tripped up, but if the message is good, he can't regret doing it, he said Thursday.", "augmented": []}

The commission could be run out of the Oval Office, perhaps overseen by senior domestic adviser Susan Rice, and have a staff that included a congressional liaison to help pursue legislative programs while simultaneously using executive authority wherever possible to achieve its objective.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "First, the new administration should organize a diverse group of scholars who will be charged with offering a comprehensive and holistic portrait of America's racial history. The Pulitzer Prize-winning 1619 Project by Nikole Hannah-Jones offers an important template in this regard, but one that -- even as it has been debated among historians -- has also been attacked on ideological grounds by conservatives and neo-Confederates for being overly critical of the nation's long political and cultural embrace of White supremacy.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "America's racial history remains, now more than ever, deeply contested. President Donald Trump's appointment of a 1776 Commission to teach patriotic education in our school systems attests to this. It is past time for national leadership that helps us clearly establish our past in all of its complexity. Understanding, for instance, racial slavery's expansive reach -- North and South -- into the creation of American capitalism gives students, citizens and leaders a more holistic appreciation of the stubborn afterlife of structural racism . The stickiness of America's current racial divide is rooted in a history that we continue to distort, gloss over or ignore at our very nation's peril.", "augmented": []}

But we are long past the time for policy tinkering with the health of Americans. Of those who insist that Medicare For All is unaffordable we should ask another question: How can we afford not to?

{"original": "1. You shouldn't necessarily want a fat tax refund.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For starters, while it's wonderful to get a hefty check from Uncle Sam after filing your tax return, that's not really such a great thing. After all, it's technically your own money that you're getting back, and the government has been hanging onto it until you filed your return. Modest refunds are common and not a problem, but big refunds generally happen when we have too much withheld from our paychecks. You can adjust your withholding by submitting another W-4 form to your employer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "2. Tax credits are more valuable than tax deductions", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Tax credits and deductions aren't the same thing. Both offer tax breaks, but tax credits are more powerful.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A deduction reduces your taxable income. Have gross income of $70,000 and a $4,000 deduction? Your taxable income is now $66,000. If you're in the 25% tax bracket, you avoid being taxed on that $4,000 and save $1,000. If you have taxable income of $70,000 and a $4,000 tax credit, however, the credit reduces your tax dollar-for-dollar. It's worth a full $4,000.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Credits are available for all kinds of things, such as education expenses, the adoption of children, and the care of children and dependents. A particularly valuable credit, if your income is low enough to qualify, is the Earned Income Tax Credit, which might shrink your taxable income by more than $6,000. The Child and Dependent Care Credit offers a credit of up to $3,000 for the care of one eligible dependent and up to $6,000, total, for two or more.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "3. You do have to report all income", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It can be easy to think that you only have to report income to the IRS that you get documentation for in the mail -- such as via a W-2 form or a 1099 form. Not true. You need to report all income, from rental income to prize money to gambling winnings. If you get paid in cash for some or all of the work you do, that, too, needs to be reported.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You should report all income because it's the right thing to do, but also because the IRS may already know about some income you're not reporting, and it will wonder why you're not reporting it. After all, entities that pay you will very often be reporting that expense to the IRS.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "4. You can't get an extension for paying your taxes", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Many people misunderstand the nature of a tax extension. When you file IRS Form 4868 for an extension, you are only postponing the filing of your return. You can't postpone paying the taxes that are due. That might sound tricky, as you may not know exactly how much you owe if you haven't yet completed your return, but the IRS expects you to make a good-faith estimate and pay that amount. (If you think your total taxes due will be around $15,000 and $12,000 was withheld by your employer, you would send in the difference, $3,000.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The IRS imposes penalties for filing a late return and for paying taxes late. Penalties can be as much as 25% of the tax owed and the unpaid tax. Even if you can't pay, file your return. And if you can pay at least some of what you owe, do so, to minimize the penalty hit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "5. You can reduce your chances of being audited", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Your chances of being audited are very low -- and were recently less than 1 in 100. Don't think it's all a matter of chance, though, because there are factors that can make an audit more likely. For example, if you have earnings that are well above average, you'll be more likely to have your return audited. If you're self-employed, you'll be more likely to be audited, as well, because it can be easier for a self-employed person to fudge numbers than it is for a salaried person.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Factors more under your control that can keep your audit odds low include being neat and legible when filling out your return, reporting all income on it (including all dividends and interest that's reported on 1099 forms), and not having math errors on it that will draw the attention of the IRS. If you report having no income at all, the IRS might question that -- which is not a problem if you really did have no income. It may also question bigger-than-usual deductions such as for charitable donations or business expenses. Again, such deductions might get you audited, but they won't cause much trouble if they're legitimate and you have documentation to back them up.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "6. You have rights as a taxpayer", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You might feel powerless against the IRS, but you do have rights. There is a Taxpayer Bill of Rights that was adopted by the IRS in 2014, assuring us the right to be informed, the right to quality service, the right to pay no more than the correct amount of tax, and the right to challenge the IRS, among others", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There's even a Taxpayer Advocate Service, headed by our National Taxpayer Advocate, Nina Olson. Ms. Olson regularly informs Congress of problems she sees in our tax system and makes recommendations for fixing them. Her office also helps thousands of taxpayers with various problems every year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "7. The IRS will not phone you", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Finally, the IRS is never going to call you out of the blue -- and it won't send out unsolicited email, either. If you receive a phone call, as many people have, from someone saying they're with the IRS and that they need you to make a payment immediately or they need your Social Security number or bank account or credit card numbers, don't believe them. There are many tax scams out there bilking taxpayers out of money.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Getting your personal information can help a scammer engage in identity theft -- filing a tax return in your name and collecting a refund. The IRS is aware of and has been tackling this problem, and in fiscal year 2015, it initiated 776 identity theft related investigations, resulting in 774 sentencings. Working behind the scenes, in the first nine months of 2016, it reduced the number of people who filed affidavits with the IRS saying they were victims of identity theft by almost half, compared to 2015 -- with affadavits dropping from 512,278 to 237,750.

In addition to his Covid-19 response and the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, Trump's handling of his first impeachment Senate trial, racial justice protests following the death of George Floyd and other Black Americans and his challenge to the 2020 election represents his time in office boiled down to a year, they said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Trump has set himself apart for his style of communication, including freewheeling speeches and speaking off the cuff in an informal manner.

{"original": "1. Create an emergency fund first", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The first step is to create an emergency fund that will cover three to six months of expenses, even before you start saving for retirement.

{"original": "2. Look to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Once you've got emergecy funds covered, it's time to move onto retirement savings. Without the option to invest in a 401(k), the next best tax-advantaged way to do this is through an IRA. There are two main types of IRAs: A Roth IRA and a traditional IRA.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For Roth IRAs, contributions are made with after-tax dollars and future withdrawals are tax free. It's a pretty sweet deal, but in order to qualify, you need to be earning less than $133,000 ($196,000 if your married). Traditional IRAs are tax-deductible in the year you make the contribution, but most withdrawals are taxed at ordinary income tax rates.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So which one is right for you? If you're very young and far from retirement, there's a good chance you don't earn very much so you're in a lower tax bracket. If that's the case, the Roth IRA may make more sense.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If he/she invests aggressively, they could benefit from decades of tax-free growth, said James H. Saulnier, a certified financial planner based in Fort Collins, Colorado.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But if you're salary is pretty high and you're in a higher tax bracket, or you just make too much to qualify for a Roth, the traditional IRA is the way to go, says Sean M. Pearson, a certified financial planner and associate vice president at Ameriprise Financial Services.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The downside is that no matter which IRA you go for, you're limited to contributing no more than $5,500 for the year (you can throw in an extra $1,000 once you turn 50). That's significantly less than what employer-sponsored plans like 401(k)s allow.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "It's a great way to open what I call a 'starter' Roth IRA, says Saulnier.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "4. Don't forget about the Health Savings Account (HSA)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Some financial planners say a health savings account is the best-kept secret of retirement savings. That's because HSAs are the only savings vehicles that offer a triple tax benefit. Contributions you make are pre-tax, which means they lower your taxable income. The money grows tax-deferred while it's in the account, and withdrawals you make are tax-free as long as the funds are used for medical expenses.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The drawback of an HSA is that you must have a high-deductible health insurance plan to be eligible to contribute to one. But if you are, think of an HSA as a great tool to boost your retirement savings.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "No matter where you save your money, the most important thing is that you're saving.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A good rule of thumb is to save 10% of your income for retirement, says Pearson. If 10% is too high for you, start by saving every penny you can.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "There's no way to put a happy face on this. You are way short of the amount of savings someone of your age and with your income should have in order to be able to retire anytime in the near future and maintain your current standard of living.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Still, you can definitely improve your chance of having a more secure retirement than if you continue along your current path, although doing so will require you to put retirement planning at the very top of your list of financial priorities. You'll also have to commit to some significant lifestyle changes in years before you retire, and possibly afterwards.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Related: Do you need $1 million to retire? Maybe", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The two most important things you need to do are no secret. You know what I'm going to suggest, as does anyone who understands the basic dynamics of how retirement works.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The first thing is you've got to start shoveling money into retirement savings accounts like you've never done before. I'm talking big-time savings here. The second thing you'll have to do is stay on the job for quite a while, at the very least into your late 60s, longer if you can manage it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Because the fact is that, short of winning the lottery, coming into an inheritance or being on the receiving end of some other windfall, the combination of ratcheting up your savings rate and remaining on the job is your best shot at achieving a relatively secure and comfortable retirement. And even if you do those two things (as well as the others I'll suggest) you'll still probably have to scale back your standard of living somewhat.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Normally, someone who's been saving throughout his career and is now in the home stretch to retirement would be stashing between 10% and 15% of pay into retirement accounts. Since you don't have the accumulated savings someone in that position would have, you need to get to the upper end of that 10%-to-15% range at the very least, and preferably push yourself to save even more.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So let's take a look at how much you might be able to accumulate. Assuming you save 15% a year, get 2% annual pay raises and earn a 5% yearly rate of return on your original $75,000 plus your annual savings, you would end up with a nest egg at age 65 of roughly $166,000. If you manage to put away 20% of your salary, you could be looking at a nest egg of about $190,000.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Clearly, that puts you in a lot better position than you're in now, but hardly on easy street. Assuming a 4% initial withdrawal subsequently adjusted for inflation, a nest egg of $190,000 would generate about $7,600 a year of sustainable retirement income, or about $633 a month. Certainly not enough to allow for living large.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The picture improves dramatically, however, if you continue to work and save beyond age 65. For example, save 15% a year and work until you're 70, and you could be looking at a nest egg of roughly $290,000. Save at a 20%-a-year rate, and you're talking about entering retirement with roughly $345,000 in savings.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Figure on an initial withdrawal rate of, say, 4.5% (higher than the age-65 withdrawal rate to allow for the fact that your money doesn't have to last as long), and a nest egg that size might produce annual income of just over $15,000, or nearly $1,300 a month, or about double the amount you would have saving 20% to age 65.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Working longer has another benefit besides allowing you to boost the size of your nest egg: It allows you to qualify for a larger Social Security check. Generally, your Social Security benefit increases roughly 7% to 8% for each year you postpone Social Security between the ages of 62 and 70. (You get no increase for postponing benefits after reaching age 70.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In your case, taking Social Security at 70 rather than, say, 65, would boost your Social Security benefit by more than 40%. In fact, you'd probably end up with an even larger increase after also taking into account the extra years of pay you earned (and paid Social Security payroll tax on) during that period. You can see how the combination of saving more and working longer can improve your outlook for retirement by going to this retirement income calculator.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Of course, saying you can save more and work longer and actually doing it are two different things. You clearly haven't been saving regularly throughout your career, so starting now, especially at a high rate, will be quite a shock. You've been living a lifestyle that depends on spending most of what you earn. You're going to have to exercise some willpower to make the transition to being a serious saver.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Similarly, even if you're willing, you may not be able to stay on the job as long as you prefer. For example, nearly four in 10 workers said they don't plan to retire until after age 65, according to a recent Gallup poll. At the same time, though, the Employee Benefit Research Institute's 2017 Retirement Confidence Survey shows that nearly half of retirees said they retired earlier than they planned, often because they had a health problem or had to care for a spouse or other relative or because they were simply ousted from their job.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Given the reality that you may not be able to continue working and saving as long you'd like, it's all the more important to push yourself to save as much as you can as long as you still have the opportunity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Related: How do I figure out how much to save for retirement?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There are other steps you may also want to take. For example, if you own a home, you might consider downsizing and/or taking out a reverse mortgage as a way to turn home equity into spendable cash that can supplement Social Security and draws from your savings.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You might also combine either or both of those moves with relocating to an area of the country that has lower living costs. This cost of living calculator can help you compare the cost of living in more than 200 U.S. cities.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "One caution: Investing aggressively to earn higher gains may seem like a reasonable strategy to boost the size of your nest egg, especially since many pros expect investment returns will be lower in the years ahead than in the past. But such a move could backfire, leaving you vulnerable to big losses that may be difficult to bounce back from at your age. You're better off focusing on saving more and maintaining a reasonable balance between growth and safety in your retirement portfolio.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I'm sure you've gathered by now that improving your retirement prospects isn't going to be easy. But I have one final suggestion that may provide some motivation. Go to Social Security's Retirement Estimator tool and see what your projected Social Security benefit will be at various ages. And then ask yourself how you would feel having to live solely or even mostly on that monthly income after you retire. Ideally, the answer will spur you to take action to improve your retirement outlook as much as you can.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "GOP rivals point fingers in South Carolina debate Candidate face-off is last before Saturday primary COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN) -- The final debate before Saturday's South Carolina GOP primary was marked Tuesday by accusations of negative campaigning, and the three remaining rivals answered questions on such stalwart Republican issues as tax cuts, the death penalty, abortion and nuclear arms. The free-flowing format of the debate, which was moderated by CNN's Larry King, led to several lively repartees between Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Arizona Sen. John McCain and former Ambassador Alan Keyes, who, when they were not taking aim at one another, fired shots at President Bill Clinton. It's kind of politics, Bush said of the negative turn the South Carolina campaign has taken. Saying he had let the other candidates define him in the campaign's early days, Bush vowed: I'm not going to let it happen again. And unfortunately you ran an ad that equated me to Bill Clinton, he said to McCain. That's about as low a blow that you can give in a Republican primary. There was an ad run against me, we ran a counter ad in New Hampshire, McCain shot back. Then I was beat up pretty bad by his surrogates comparing me to Clinton, 'Clinton lite,'  McCain said, running through the campaign's negative twists and turns. This is an attack piece, Bush said as he held up a flyer he said was placed on a voter's windshield. That's not by my campaign, McCain insisted.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Well it says 'paid for by Sen. John McCain,' Bush said. You can disagree with me on issues, John, but do not question my trustworthiness and do not compare me with Bill Clinton. Keyes, who badly trails both candidates in the polls, spent much of the night saying that such squabbling was not what voters want. You say this is being transmitted to 200 countries and all I'm sitting here listening to is these two guys going on about their ads? he said. The problem, he said, stemmed from the fact that people are trying so hard to be all things to all people ... so they get into this spitting match over who did what to whom. When asked about tax cuts, both Bush and McCain defended their proposals. The difference between Gov. Bush's proposal and mine is I put a whole lot into shoring up Social Security and paying down the debt, and he puts a whole lot into tax cuts, McCain said. It's not the Washington mentality -- it's the grown-up mentality, McCain said of his $240 billion tax cut plan. The plan, he said, would pay off the debt and provide tax cuts to low- and moderate-income Americans while saving Social Security. If we have a debt, we ought to pay it off, McCain said, vowing to veto any bill that increases spending if elected president. I won't just be a hapless bystander.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I don't trust Congress; I trust people and I want to give people their money back -- grown-up or non-grown-up, Bush said. Either you trust the people or you trust government. His five-year, $483 billion tax cut plan would spend more of the surplus on tax cuts than McCain's. On the same day that Democratic presidential front-runner Al Gore received the endorsement of a major abortion-rights group, the Republican rivals argued over who was the most anti-abortion candidate. The political questions around abortions are these and this is one that's gonna differentiate us from the Democratic nominee, Bush said when McCain questioned him on his pro-life stance and whether he supported the right to an abortion in cases of rape, incest or to preserve a woman's life. I will sign a ban on partial-birth abortion, Bush said of a controversial late-term abortion procedure that Congress has twice passed and the president has twice vetoed. We need to keep the platform the way it is, bush said of the GOP plank that calls for a consitutional amendment banning abortion. The Texas governor reaffirmed his support for the death penalty when asked whether he would follow the lead of Gov. George Ryan (R-Illinois), who suspended executions in the state after 13 death row inmates were found innocent. Bush insisted that every inmate executed on his watch was guilty.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There's no doubt in my mind that each person who has been executed in my state was guilty of their crime, he said, adding that if someone's innocent they shouldn't be put to death. All three candidates support the death penalty, but the Texas governor, by nature of his office, is the only candidate to have presided over executions. When the question was posed to McCain, he said that DNA technology would provoke a review of certain cases, but I certainly wouldn't abandon the death penalty. The death penalty is appropriate punishment as penalty for some crimes, McCain said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Living on a fixed income poses a significant challenge for many retirees. Unless you're willing to work part-time in retirement, once you leave your career behind, your options for generating extra cash will be limited at best.

{"original": "That large house and yard undoubtedly served you well when you had kids living under your roof, but if you're an empty-nester with more space than you know what to do with, it may be time to consider downsizing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The average homeowner spends 1% to 4% of his or her home's value on annual maintenance and repairs, but if you trade in your current home for a smaller one, you might slash your expenses in half. After all, it's cheaper to heat and cool a 1,500-square-foot house than a home twice that size, and maintaining a modest backyard is far easier than mowing and trimming a much larger property.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Remember, while you may be used to tackling home maintenance yourself, thus keeping your costs to a minimum, as you age, your ability to do so might decline. Furthermore, as homes age, they tend to require additional maintenance, thus adding to your overall expense. If you move to a smaller space and manage to find one better in better condition, you might save yourself thousands of dollars in upkeep year after year.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Though coverage under Medicare begins at age 65, your initial enrollment window opens three months before the month of your 65th birthday and ends three months after the month you turn 65. But if you fail to sign up during that seven-month window, you could end up paying more than you need to for Medicare Part B, which covers doctor visits and diagnostic services. Specifically, for every 12-month period you go without coverage upon becoming eligible, you'll be penalized in the form of a 10% increase in your Part B premiums.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Signing up late for Medicare Part D, which covers prescription drugs, can also cost you. If you go 63 days or more without coverage, you'll face a penalty equal to 1% of the national base beneficiary premium -- which is currently $35.63 -- times the number of months you go without coverage. Signing up 20 months late, for example, will add $7.10 per month to your Part D premiums. It pays to arrange for Medicare coverage in advance so that you don't wind up paying more than you need to.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Tempting as it may be to take advantage of those early-bird specials, if you're looking to save money in retirement, dining at home is a good way to do it. The typical restaurant charges a 300% markup for the food it serves, which means a $15 entree can usually be prepared for a mere $5 at home. While dining out on occasion can be a worthwhile treat, the more you cook at home, the less you'll spend on food overall.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When we think about living expenses, we tend to consider everyday necessities like groceries, electricity, and clothing. But taxes can be a significant expense for seniors as well. Thankfully, there are a number of tax breaks available to seniors that can result in some serious savings.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you're still working, contributing to a Roth IRA is one of the best ways to lower your taxes in retirement. That's because Roth IRA withdrawals aren't subject to taxes, nor are you required to take them at any given point in time. Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, by contrast, impose required minimum distributions starting at age 70 1/2, and once you're forced to remove funds from a non-Roth account, you'll be subject to the taxes that go along with them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Another good option for lowering your taxes is taking advantage of the medical expense deduction. Currently, you can deduct out-of-pocket medical costs that exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income (AGI). This means that if you spend $10,000 a year on healthcare and have an AGI of $60,000, you can deduct any amount above $6,000 -- which, in this case, is $4,000. Since medical care is the one expense that tends to universally go up among seniors, it pays to track your spending and keep impeccable records so that you know what sort of deduction to claim.", "augmented": []}

The process also requires that proposals have no impact on social security and that the impacts on the budget do not stretch beyond a 10-year window if the changes are permanent.

She's not guided by either clear legal principles, because she changes them over time, or by precedent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It also tells us that the courts, as subject to elite opinion, as fellow elites in the culture, the public really doesn't like racial preferences. They support affirmative action, but not race preferences, although the elites do. And they, of course, upheld race preferences in the Michigan case, not affirmative action. And it also says that if something becomes controversial, like the antisodomy laws, they'll change their precedent, in just 17 years ago. They're not content to leave that to the democratic process. People have changed their minds, which is why only 13 states have such laws, and they're largely unenforced.

{"original": "CARLSON: Jim, by the time the United States took action against Iraq, there were U.N. resolutions that had been violated, Iraq had invaded Kuwait, and Iran, for that matter.

{"original": "WALSH: Well, it's a good question, Margaret. You know, where is the U.S. leverage here? And it's certainly not in something like trade sanctions, because we don't do a lot of trade with Iran, and we don't recognize them as a country. It's really the nonproliferation regime where we have the most leverage.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Why? Because we can request inspections of undeclared facilities. We can require that the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, go police and keep an eye on Iran.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So I think that's a powerful tool. And I think we also want to be trying to strengthen the nonproliferation constituencies within Iran. Iran is nothing but a giant argument.

There are thousand divisions, a thousand factions, and we want to make sure the factions that oppose nuclear weapons are stronger than those that want nuclear weapons.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "O'BEIRNE: Jim, beyond being persuaded of the value of having a nuclear capability, what lessons do you think Iran drew from the recent action in Iraq, that they can count on a divided world to stall around until they do develop a capacity?

{"original": "WALSH: Well, it's a great question. I can't really get into the minds of the Iranians.

{"original": "Whole life insurance is a type of permanent life insurance that's meant to last until the day you die, regardless of age. According to the Insurance Information Institute, whole life is the most common type of permanent life insurance purchased — other types of permanent coverage include variable life insurance and universal life.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "With most whole life insurance policies, consumers pay the same premium for the duration of their policy. Meanwhile, the death benefit typically also stays the same, regardless of how long you live. Obviously, this means that while whole life insurance premiums don't become more expensive as you age, the overall total cost of your whole life policy gets larger and larger as you get older and have to continue submitting another premium payment each month.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But your family will receive the death benefit of your policy no matter how long you live, unlike term life insurance that only lasts for a set period of time.

Well, there are many advantages that come with buying whole life insurance, starting with the fact that the death benefit is guaranteed as long as you pay your premiums.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you worry that your loved ones will struggle financially or not have enough money for your final expenses when you die, then having a guaranteed death benefit for your entire life is a huge advantage that may be worth the added cost.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Also, while your premiums may seem expensive when you're young and in good health, they could be relatively affordable in relation to your death benefit once you reach an advanced age. That's another big advantage of whole life — your premiums will always remain the same, even as your age increases and your health declines.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And don't forget that whole life comes with a savings component that builds cash value. The cash value of your policy grows each month that you pay for whole life insurance, since a part of your premium is set aside. In most cases, this amount becomes accessible for you to use for any reason.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Meanwhile, some whole life companies also pay dividends. Any dividends you receive can add to the cash value of your policy. Depending on the insurer, you may even be able to use your dividends to pay for part or all of your insurance premiums.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Finally, whole life insurance comes with tax benefits, including the fact that your beneficiaries will likely receive your death benefit without having to pay income tax on it. If you're a high-net-worth individual who wants to pass on tax-free money to your heirs, a whole life insurance policy can help you do that.", "augmented": []}

Many customers also borrow against the cash value of their whole life insurance policies, which they can do without paying income taxes. However, the rules regarding how and when you access the cash value in your policy can vary, so you'll need to check the details with your insurer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Also, you're never stuck with a whole life insurance policy. You can surrender your policy at any time, stop paying your premiums and in most cases take out the cash value that's accrued. However, you'll likely owe income tax on any amounts you receive this way, so make sure to speak with your whole life agent or a tax adviser before you take this step.", "augmented": []}

Compare whole life premiums with at least three different life insurance companies, and find out what it would cost for a similar amount of term life insurance coverage as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "At the end of the day, whole life insurance is more likely to be utilized by higher-net-worth individuals since the premiums are so much more expensive, but it can be an asset for anyone who wants to make sure money is left behind for their heirs.

Why is this not such a big deal?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Kelton: Few people understand what the national debt is, and most people tend to conflate government deficits with the national debt. So let's start by clarifying these terms. The national debt is nothing more than a historical record of all the dollars that were spent by government but not taxed back. When the government spends more than it collects in the form of taxes (and other payments), we label it deficit spending. But that's only part of the story. To complete the picture, suppose the government spends $100 into the economy but only taxes $90 back out. The result is a surplus equal to $10 that shows up somewhere in the non-government part of the economy. In other words, the government's red ink becomes our black ink. Their deficits are our financial surpluses. So where does the debt come into play? Whenever the government runs a deficit, it sells government bonds called U.S. Treasuries. This is usually referred to as borrowing, but that's actually misleading. What's really happening is that the government is allowing people to trade in their dollars for a bond that pays some interest. A pretty good deal if you happen to be lucky enough to hold some of that $22 trillion.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CNN: What size annual deficit would worry you and why?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Kelton: Inflation is the relevant risk, not the size of the annual deficit. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, budget deficits rose to more than 10 percent of GDP. They were big, by historic standards, but they were nothing to worry about. In fact, most economists seem to agree that bigger (and better targeted) deficits would have helped the economy recover much more quickly. Today, the government is running annual budget deficits that are expected to reach $1 trillion. That's a lot of zeros, but so what? Remember, their red ink is our black ink. What worries me about the deficits we're running today is not their size but their nature. A big part of the reason the government is running bigger deficits right now is because Republicans voted for tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the richest Americans and large corporations. Income and wealth inequality—already at alarming levels—will only widen. So I worry about the way these deficits are being used to funnel resources to the people who least need the help.", "augmented": []}

What keeps politicians in check with what they can promise to voters. Or should there be a brake?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Kelton: The brake is inflation. If policymakers run wild, cutting taxes and pumping money into the economy with reckless abandon, inflation will spike and voters will (presumably) check those politicians at the ballot box. So, in a sense, democracy is the thing that keeps politicians in check. But that doesn't mean we can't pass Medicare-for-All or make public colleges and universities tuition-free, even with the tax cuts in place. The debt is not the constraining factor (except, perhaps, politically). The point is this: the economic constraint is inflation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CNN: Part of what you argue is that if inflation gets out of hand, that's a good time for Congress to raise taxes. But the political momentum is in the opposite direction, as we saw last year with the tax cuts. What's your thinking on where political reality runs into economic theory?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Kelton: I believe the government should use the federal budgeting process to maintain a balanced economy. That means balancing the risks of inflation against the benefits of full employment. It means embarking on new spending programs only if those programs can be implemented without causing excessive inflation. It might be necessary to raise taxes in order to prevent, say, a massive infrastructure program from pushing the economy beyond its limit. But taxes aren't the only way to curb inflation. The most important thing is to understand what's actually driving the inflation. Historically, the big drivers of inflation have been: energy, housing, and health care. So even if the political reality means you can't raise taxes, you can still fight inflation with policies that increase the supply of available housing units, promote energy efficiency, and lower health care costs. I also wouldn't discount the possibility that our political realities might evolve rather quickly with an MMT-informed Congress.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CNN: Is MMT a socialist idea or is it a free market idea? Explain.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Kelton: Neither. MMT is mostly a descriptive project. It provides a lens that can be used to understand how a modern, capitalist economy works.

{"original": "In other words, the first $X you earn would be taxed at 0%. And that 0% is possibly the fourth bracket to which Trump alluded.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But here's the thing: Under today's code, the standard deduction effectively serves as a 0% rate, said Len Burman, a former deputy assistant secretary for tax analysis at Treasury.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That is, your adjusted gross income is automatically reduced by $6,300 if you're single, or by $12,600 if you're married filing jointly. So it removes that amount from your federal taxable income.", "augmented": []}

Or maybe he was merely emphasizing the effect a larger standard deduction would have for those who don't earn much. Or maybe he was just hinting that his next plan will do a better job of not increasing taxes for some low- and moderate income parents, who might be hurt by various other changes he called for, such as a repeal of certain exemptions and the head of household status.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Retirement investing is mostly contextual. So much depends on your risk tolerance, how much time you have before you retire, and how much you can save.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "However, there are a few best practices that are nearly universal. So keep these in mind, whether you're a few years from retirement or still have decades to go.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Uncle Sam wants you saving for retirement, so the U.S. tax code has all kinds of incentives to sock away money for your golden years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Your workplace retirement plan (whether 401(k), 403(b), TSP, etc.) comes with specific tax benefits. If it's a traditional 401(k) (or equivalent plan), you get to reduce your taxable income by a dollar for every dollar you put in. So if you save $18,500 (the limit for 2018 if you're under 50 years old; it's $24,500 if you're age 50 or older) in a 401(k), your taxable income will be reduced by $18,500 that year. That means you'd get to pocket a rather nice tax savings that year and not have to pay taxes on any of that money until you withdraw it in retirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Many workplace retirement plans also come in the Roth flavor -- which means you don't get to save on taxes this year, but that money won't be taxed at all in retirement. IRAs (which you can open on your own, and fund with up to $5,500 per year -- or $6,500 if you're age 55 or older) also come in both flavors. There are arguments for both, so learn more about Roth vs. Traditional accounts if you're unsure where you stand.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's not just Uncle Sam who's trying to help you retire. Chances are good that, if your employer offers you access to a retirement plan like a 401(k), they also offer you some incentives to participate. Usually these incentives take the form of matching funds, whereby if you put a certain amount aside in your retirement plan, your employer will contribute some cash on top to help boost your account balance. For example, employers often offer a 50% match on contributions of up to 6% of an employee's salary. In that case, if you're setting aside 6% of your salary in your 401(k), your employer will contribute an additional amount equal to 3% of your salary.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In that example, you wouldn't get anything extra from your employer for anything you contribute above 6%, but you'd still get the tax benefits. Anyway, bottom line: At the very least, if at all possible, make sure you max out your employer match. Think about it this way: If you make $50,000 a year and contribute 6% for a 50% employer match, you're putting in $3,000 annually -- and your employer pays you an extra $1,500 in your 401(k) as a thank-you for doing that. That's a nice chunk of change.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A study published in 2015 estimated that American workers were leaving $24 billion in matching funds on the table each year (an average of $1,336 per worker who failed to take full advantage) by not maxing out their employer match. That's free money. Claim it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Fees are one of the two great killers of investing returns -- second only to making bad investments. It can be difficult to predict how great or terrible an investment will be, but fortunately, fees are a lot easier to identify. And the savings are potentially huge. In fact, a 1-percentage-point reduction in fees could net you an extra $43,000 or more. How?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Let's say you invested $3,000 per year for 30 years into a fund that tracks the S&P 500, returns 6% annually (a little less than historical stock market returns), and has a 1.14% expense ratio. At the end of 30 years, you'll have a little over $201,000. That's a nice chunk of change.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now let's say you put the same amounts into the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFINX) over the same time period at the same hypothetical annual return. The Vanguard fund, however, has a 0.14% expense ratio -- that's 1 percentage point lower than the other fund's, all for the same exact investments. You'd end 30 years with a little over $244,000 -- an extra $43,000 -- by tracking the same underlying investment.", "augmented": []}

It doesn't want you to be able to hang on to that money forever; after a certain point, it wants to be able to start collecting taxes on the money in these accounts. Thus, you'll be forced to take distributions (and pay taxes on them) whether or not you actually need the income. And because the distributions are taxed as income, this can cause all kinds of other tax complications such as raising your tax bracket (and your capital gains rate as a result), and making your Social Security benefits partially taxable.", "augmented": []}

I'm always inspired by young men and women who grew up in the South when segregation was still taking place, when, you know, the transformations that are still incomplete but at least had begun had not yet begun.

{"original": "So we are passionate about our cause, our candidacy, what we believe, what we want to do for America. And it is a great privilege for me to be part of this.

Because that's what it's about for me.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Politics is not a game. It is the most serious of business. We have seen that over the last seven years. We have seen what a difference it makes when we have a president who is indifferent to and insensitive about the real-life struggles of Americans, and I want to be the champion that once again gives Americans the feeling that they have a president who cares about them and can produce results for them.

{"original": "And, as I've said before, I do not at all begrudge -- I would expect that Bill Clinton would campaign vigorously on your behalf. Obviously, he's the ex-president, so that means that the gets a lot of outsized attention and there's nothing long with that. That's, as you said, an asset to the campaign.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I have been troubled, and we already had this discussion, so I don't want to go over it again, the degree to which my record is not accurately portrayed. But that's standard practice in some of our political battles.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What I do want to focus on, though, is how important it is, when you talked about taking on the Republicans, how important it is I think to redraw the political map in this country. And the reason I say that is that we have gone through the 2000 election, the 2004 election, both of which were disappointing elections.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But the truth is that we as Democrats have not had a working majority in a very long time. And what I mean by that is a working majority that could push through the kinds of bold initiatives that all of us have proposed. And one of the reasons that I am running for president is because I believe that I can inspire new people to get involved in the process, that I can reach out to independents and, yes, some Republicans who have also lost trust in their government and want to see something new.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When you look at Bush and Cheney and their record, the one good thing they've done for us is they have given their party a very bad name.", "augmented": []}

We want to expand the scope of the electorate so that we can start getting a 60 percent majority, more folks in the House, more folks in the Senate, and I think that's something I can do.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: And that's why we've seen record turnout in every election so far. I'm not taking all the credit for it. I think people are voting against George Bush. But I also think that we've inspired people who had not previously voted before, and that's what the Democratic Party has to do.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "EDWARDS: I would just add on it's just really important for primary voters in South Carolina and all the other subsequent primaries to understand they're not just voting in a primary.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "They're voting to establish what we're going to be doing next November and who our candidate will be next November. And it's becoming increasingly likely, I think, that John McCain is going to be the Republican candidate.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "We do well in the big urban areas. The question is: Are we competitive in the rural areas, in the tougher places for Democrats to compete?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And the only thing I would say -- and I think it has nothing to do with race and gender. Let me be really clear about that. It's amazing now that being the white male...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: You're feeling all defensive about it, John. It's all right, man.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What I was going to say, though, is being able to go everywhere in America and campaign and to compete -- and I grew up in the rural south, in small towns all across the rural south, and I think I can go everywhere and compete head-to-head with John McCain.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And, actually, the last time I saw one of your polls that had all three of us against John McCain, I was the one that beat John McCain everywhere in America.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I think we need to be able to have a candidate when people are voting -- it's not the only consideration. Lord knows, if you don't agree with what we stand for, and you don't believe in us, our character and our ability to lead this country, you should not vote for us, no matter what it means for the general election.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But if you believe in our passion, our strength, our toughness, our independence from these special interests -- I've never taken money from a Washington lobbyist or a special interest PAC, which is different than these two guys, over our whole career.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But what I would say that I think what that means is I can go anywhere in America and compete against John McCain and win.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BLITZER: We have to take a quick break, but we have a lot more to talk about, much more of this presidential debate here in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, when we come back.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: ... where in northern Nevada, in places like Elko, I won by 30 points. And we were attracting Independents and some Republicans. You know, this is the same way that I was able to win the election in Illinois, going to downstate Illinois. So, I think it's important for us not to assume that we can't reach out to people of all -- of all persuasions, and I want to just take one last example on this, and that is on the issue of faith.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: You know, I am a proud Christian. And the...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I think there have been times -- there have been times where our Democratic Party did not reach out as aggressively as we could to evangelicals, for example, because the assumption was, well, they don't agree with us on choice, or they don't agree with us on gay rights, and so we just shouldn't show up. And when you don't show up, if you're not going to church, then you're not talking to church folk. And that means that people have a very right-wing perspective in terms of what faith means and of defining our faith.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: And as somebody who believes deeply in the precepts of Jesus Christ, particularly treating the least of these in a way that he would, that it is important for us to not concede that ground. Because I think we can go after those folks and get them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BLITZER: All right. Suzanne has a question on faith to all of you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: ... let me just get in here, because there are a lot of polls showing that I'm beating them higher than anybody else. I don't think that has -- I don't think, frankly, that has much to recommend this far from an election.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If John is right and Senator McCain is the Republican nominee, we know that once again we will have a general election about national security. That is what will happen.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I believe of any one of us, I am better positioned and better able to take on John McCain or any Republican when it comes to issues about protecting and defending our country and promoting our interest in the world. And if it is indeed the classic Republican campaign, I've been there. I've done that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "They've been after me for 16 years, and much to their dismay I am still here. And I intend to be still here when that election comes around and we win in November 2008.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "EDWARDS: I just want to add that I think it's about -- I don't think it's about polls either, Hillary, by the way. But I do think it is about fundamental differences between us and them. And this is a difference that you and I have.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You know, I think that John McCain has made central to his time in public life, in his campaign, campaign finance reform and cleaning up the money in politics. And I think it's dangerous for us to send somebody against him who presents a contrast to what he represents. And I'm proud of the fact that I've never taken money from a Washington lobbyist or a special interest PAC.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "EDWARDS: And I have a question -- I have a question that I'm interested in hearing you respond to. You've talked a lot about day one. I've committed -- I don't know what Barack has said about this -- but I've committed not to have any corporate lobbyists working in my White House on the first day that I'm president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Will you make the same commitment?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, you know, John, I will make the commitment to have people in the White House who are honest and trustworthy and put the interests of the United States first. But I think...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: You know what? I don't know.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I don't know, because I'm not in favor of corporate lobbyists, but you keep drawing these artificial distinctions. You take money from people who employ lobbyists, who are married to lobbyists, who are the children of lobbyists.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And, you know, at some point this gets really hard to take, because if you are someone like I am, who has withstood the full force of corporate lobbyists, starting with the health insurance companies, and the drug companies, and the oil companies, and everybody that I've taken on for all of these years, you know, I think I'm independent and tough enough to be able to deal with anybody. And that's what I intend to do.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "EDWARDS: Those people, though -- here's the problem, Hillary. Everybody is listening. They can make their own judgment about this. They don't have to depend on us. When somebody gives you millions and millions of dollars, I think they expect something. I don't think they're doing it for nothing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, John, trial lawyers have given you millions and millions of dollars. So...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "EDWARDS: And what they expect from me is they expect me to stand up for democracy, for the right to jury trial, for the right for little people to be heard in the courtroom. And that is exactly what I stand up for.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That is not the same thing. That is not the same thing as corporate lobbyists who are in there every single day lobbying against the interests of middle-class Americans. And I think we need a president who can stand up.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We have a difference about this. You're entitled to your view. But we have a real difference about it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: No, we don't have a real difference. Where we stand is -- where I stand is for public financing. I'm going to do everything I can to get public financing, to get the money out of American politics.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But, you know, Barack has a lot of lobbyists who are leading his campaign here in South Carolina. John has had lobbyists who've been working hard for him all of these years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The point is that you've got to say no. You've got to say no.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: And, yes, I think that we will say no consistently in order to have a positive agenda that is actually going to make a difference. Do you have to stand up to the lobbyists? Yes. But the lobbyists represent the interests that are paying the lobbyists. So to go and focus on the lobbyists, you know, kind of misses the point.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: Let me just interject on this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Hillary, you're right. Nobody's hands are perfectly clean in politics. That is true. I mean, there a distinction, though, between not taking PAC and federal lobbyist money and having that as a major way of driving your campaign and having some ancillary involvement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But, you know, I don't want to go down that route. What I want to really focus on is this issue of national security, because I think you've repeated this a number of times. You are the person best prepared on national security issues on day one, and so if you're running against John McCain, that you can go toe-to-toe.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I fundamentally disagree with that. And I want to tell you why, because I believe that the way we are going to take on somebody like a John McCain on national security is not that we're sort of -- we've been sort of like John McCain, but not completely, you know, we voted for the war, but we had reservations.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I think it's going to be somebody who can serve a strong contrast and say, We've got to overcome the politics of fear in this country. As commander-in-chief...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As commander-in-chief, all of us would have a responsibility to keep the American people safe. That's our first responsibility. And I would not hesitate to strike against anybody who would do Americans or American interests' harm.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: Wait, Wolf, let me finish. I was listening to these folks quite some time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What I do believe is that we have to describe a new foreign policy that says, for example, I will meet not just with our friends, but with our enemies, because I remember what John F. Kennedy said, that we should never negotiate out of fear, but we should never fear to negotiate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Having that kind of posture is the way I think we effectively debate the Republicans on this issue. Because if we just play into the same fear-mongering that they have been engaged in since 9/11, then we are playing on their battlefield, but, more importantly, we are not doing what's right in order to rebuild our alliances, repair our relationships around the world, and actually make us more safe in the long term.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "BLITZER: All right, 30 seconds, please.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "EDWARDS: What it requires is having something beyond a short- term foreign policy of convenience. I mean, Bush has done extraordinary damage to us.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "EDWARDS: But if we have a visionary foreign policy, where we re- establish America as a moral leader in the world, where we do the things that we need to do to combat global poverty, to deal with the spread of HIV/AIDS, the spread of disease at large, economic development, what it does is it takes an entire generation of young people who are sitting on the fence as I speak and on one side is Al Qaeda and Bin Laden, Islamic jihad, and on the other side is the United States of America, which way do they go?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That depends entirely on us. If they continue to see this foreign policy of belligerence, selfishness, only interested in the expansion of American power, we will drive them in the other direction.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If, on the other hand, they see America as the light, the source of hope and opportunity, it will pull them to us like a magnet. We need to be that light again.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We are completely out of time, but we have time for one final question that I'd like to ask all three of you to respond and, if possible, within one minute or less, and it's an important question on this important day.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And, Senator Edwards, let me start with you. If Dr. Martin Luther King were alive today, unfortunately, he's not, but if he were alive today, why do you think he would or why should he endorse you?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "EDWARDS: For two reasons. One is that -- we've talked about this a great deal already -- I met with Martin III in Atlanta on Saturday and he was very kind about me pushing the single biggest issue -- two biggest issues that Dr. King stood for, which are the issues of equality and ending poverty in America.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I've been on at least part of his poor people's campaign. I was in Marks, Mississippi, among other places. I mean, I have been pushing this issue as aggressively and as loudly as I possibly can and I will do it as long as I'm alive, because it is central to what I believe.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He also worked very hard for the Voting Rights Act and he would look at an America today where almost half of our people don't vote. They're disenchanted. They -- Barack's spoken about this. They feel disengaged.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And what we need is a president of the United States who actually believes to their core in equality, who's willing to fight for that equality, who's willing to do things that may not be politically popular. And fighting to end poverty in America may not get you any votes, but it is the right thing to do.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: Well, I don't think Dr. King would endorse any of us. I think what he would call upon the American people to do is to hold us accountable, and this goes to the core differences, I think, in this campaign.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I believe change does not happen from the top down. It happens from the bottom up. Dr. King understood that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It was those women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus, union workers who are willing to take on violence and intimidation to get the right to organize. It was women who decided, I'm as smart as my husband. I'd better get the right to vote.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "OBAMA: them arguing, mobilizing, agitating, and ultimately forcing elected officials to be accountable, I think that's the key.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So that has been a hallmark of my career, transparency and accountability, getting the American people involved. That's how we're going to bring about change. That's why I want to be president of the United States, to respect the power of the American people to bring about change.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, there is no doubt that change comes from the extraordinary efforts of the American people. I've seen it in my life. I'm sitting here as a result of that change.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It is also true -- and Dr. King understood this. He campaigned for political leaders. He lobbied them. He pushed them. He cajoled. He did everything he could to get them over the line so that they would be part of the movement that he gave his life for.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There are people sitting in this audience right now, John Lewis, Jim Clyburn, they were part of those kinds of efforts, going so far as they could to make it clear that we had to live up to our values and our ideals.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And then there was a meeting of morality and politics. And the political leaders finally responded.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The American people should not have to work so hard to get leaders who will actually help them and recognize we are strongest when we lead by our values. Dr. King transformed the lives of so many of us, and I intend to do whatever I can to make his legacy real in the lives of Americans.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "A bit of travel is required to go here—driving or getting a taxi/Uber will be the easiest and fastest option—but, especially if it's a weekend, it's worth making the trip to Bukit Brown Cemetery. It's the largest Chinese cemetery outside of China, and it's a depository of history and heritage for Singapore. It's also home to a wide range of flora and fauna.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Most weekends, the Brownies, of the volunteer group All Things Bukit Brown, host free guided tours around the cemetery. (Check out their event page for more information.) There are introductory tours, which provide you with an overview of the culture and stories on offer in the cemetery, highlighting the tombs of notable figures and their contributions to Singapore. There are also themed tours that focus on more specific aspects of the site, such as the edible plants that grow in Bukit Brown.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Keep in mind, though, that Bukit Brown isn't quite what it used to be: More than 3,700 of over 100,000 graves have been exhumed to make way for an eight-lane highway that will cut the cemetery in half. The imminent change is why the Brownies' mission is so important and why I'm so insistent that Bukit Brown is worth the detour. As urbanization encroaches upon this historic and natural space, the need to learn, preserve, and understand its value has never been so urgent. Public awareness and care for Bukit Brown might one day be the only thing that stands between the cemetery and a top-down master plan to destroy it completely.", "augmented": []}

The compound is open from 8 a.m., but the museum opens at 10 a.m., and free tours kick off at 11 a.m. Wander down Arab Street and stop at Toko Aljunied, a friendly store offering gorgeous Peranakan kebayas, batik sarongs, jewelry, and other trinkets.", "augmented": []}

Of particular interest is the section on the Nanyang Style, referring to a group of Chinese artists who were active in Malaya in the 1950s. Trained in both Chinese and Western traditions, these artists were inspired by Southeast Asian life; the Indonesian island of Bali, for instance, provided plenty of inspiration.

More businesses would certainly have closed; more homes would have surely been lost.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So I supported the last administration's efforts to create the financial rescue program. And when we took that program over, we made it more transparent and more accountable.

{"original": "That's why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million Americans, made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their coverage through COBRA, and passed 25 different tax cuts.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "I thought I'd get some applause on that one.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As a result, millions of Americans had more to spend on gas and food and other necessities, all of which helped businesses keep more workers. And we haven't raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person, not a single dime.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, because of the steps we took, there are about 2 million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "There are stories like this all across America. And after two years of recession, the economy is growing again. Retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value. Businesses are beginning to invest again, and slowly, some are starting to hire again.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But I realize that, for every success story, there are other stories, of men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from, who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That is why jobs must be our No. 1 focus in 2010, and that's why I'm calling for a new jobs bill tonight.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, the true engine of job creation in this country will always be America's businesses...", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Through sheer grit and determination, these companies have weathered the recession and are ready to grow. But when you talk to small-business owners in places like Allentown, Pennsylvania, or Elyria, Ohio, you find out that even though banks on Wall Street are lending again, they're mostly lending to bigger companies. Financing remains difficult for small-business owners across the country, even though they're making a profit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So tonight, I'm proposing that we take $30 billion of the money Wall Street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "As the first order of business this year, I urge the Senate to do the same, and I know they will. They will.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "People are out of work. They're hurting. They need our help. And I want a jobs bill on my desk without delay.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But -- but the truth is, these steps won't make up for the 7 million jobs that we've lost over the last two years. The only way to move to full employment is to lay a new foundation for long- term economic growth and finally address the problems that America's families have confronted for years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We can't afford another so-called economic expansion like the one from last decade, what some call the lost decade, where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion, where the income of the average American household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs, where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "From the day I took office, I've been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious, such effort would be too contentious. I've been told that our political system is too gridlocked and that we should just put things on hold for a while.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For those who make these claims, I have one simple question: How long should we wait? How long should America put its future on hold? You see...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You see, Washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the problems have grown worse. Meanwhile, China's not waiting to revamp its economy; Germany's not waiting; India's not waiting.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "These nations, they're not standing still. These nations aren't playing for second place. They're putting more emphasis on math and science. They're rebuilding their infrastructure. They're making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Well, I do not accept second place for the United States of America.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As hard as it may be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become, it's time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, one place to start is serious financial reform. Look, I'm not interested in punishing banks. I'm interested in protecting our economy. A strong, healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs. It channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes. But that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We need to make sure consumers and middle-class families have the information they need to make financial decisions. We can't allow financial institutions, including those that take your deposits, to take risks that threaten the whole economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, the House has already passed financial reform with many of these changes. And -- and the lobbyists are trying to kill it. Well, we cannot let them win this fight. And if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform, I will send it back until we get it right. We've got to get it right.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Next, we need to encourage American innovation. Last year, we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history, an investment -- an investment that could lead to the world's cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy. You can see the results of last year's investments in clean energy in the North Carolina company that will create 1,200 jobs nationwide, helping to make advanced batteries, or in the California business that will put 1,000 people to work making solar panels.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But to create more of these clean-energy jobs, we need more production, more efficiency, more incentives, and that means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean-coal technologies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And, yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I'm grateful to the House for passing such a bill last year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And this year -- this year, I'm eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy. I know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But -- but here's the thing. Even if you doubt the evidence, providing incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future, because the nation that leads the clean-energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy, and America must be that nation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Third, we need to export more of our goods.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Because the more products we make and sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right here in America. So...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So tonight, we set a new goal: We will double our exports over the next five years, an increase that will support 2 million jobs in America.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "To help meet this goal, we're launching a National Export Initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports and reform export controls consistent with national security.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We have to seek new markets aggressively, just as our competitors are. If America sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals, we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the rules.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And that's why we'll continue to shape a Doha trade agreement that opens global markets and why we will strengthen our trade relations in Asia and with key partners like South Korea, and Panama, and Colombia.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Fourth, we need to invest in the skills and education of our people. Now, this year -- this year, we've broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And the idea here is simple: Instead of rewarding failure, we only reward success. Instead of funding the status quo, we only invest in reform, reform that raises student achievement, inspires students to excel in math and science, and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young Americans, from rural communities to the inner city.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In the 21st century, the best anti-poverty program around is a world-class education.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And in this country, the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than on their potential. When we renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will work with Congress to expand these reforms to all 50 states.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Still, in this economy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job. That's why I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges, which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "To make college more affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans. Instead, let's take that money and give families a $10,000 tax credit for four years of college and increase Pell Grants.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And let's tell another 1 million students that, when they graduate, they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans, and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 years, and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they chose to go to college.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And, by the way, it's time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs, because they, too, have a responsibility to help solve this problem.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle class. That's why last year I asked Vice President Biden to chair a task force on middle-class families.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's why we're nearly doubling the childcare tax credit and making it easier to save for retirement by giving access to every worker a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg. That's why we're working to lift the value of a family's single largest investment, their home.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The steps we took last year to shore up the housing market have allowed millions of Americans to take out new loans and save an average of $1,500 on mortgage payments. This year, we will step up refinancing so that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages. And...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle-class families that we still need health insurance reform.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, let's clear a few things up.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I didn't choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt. And by now, it should be fairly obvious that I didn't take on health care because it was good politics.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I took on health care because of the stories I've heard, from Americans with pre-existing conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage, patients who've been denied coverage, families, even those with insurance, who are just one illness away from financial ruin.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "After nearly a century of trying -- Democratic administrations, Republican administrations -- we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many Americans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The approach we've taken would protect every American from the worst practices of the insurance industry. It would give small businesses and uninsured Americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care. And by the way, I want to acknowledge our first lady, Michelle Obama, who this year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make kids healthier.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Our approach would preserve the right of Americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan. It would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And according to the Congressional Budget Office, the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for Congress, our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Still, this is a complex issue. And the longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became. I take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the American people. And I know that with all the lobbying and horse-trading, this process left most Americans wondering, What's in it for me?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But I also know this problem is not going away. By the time I'm finished speaking tonight, more Americans will have lost their health insurance. Millions will lose it this year. Our deficit will grow. Premiums will go up. Patients will be denied the care they need. Small-business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I will not walk away from these Americans, and neither should the people in this chamber.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As temperatures cool, I want everyone to take another look at the plan we've proposed. There's a reason why many doctors, nurses and health care experts who know our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen Medicare for seniors, and stop insurance company abuses, let me know.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Let me know. Let me know.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Here's what I ask Congress, though: Don't walk away from reform, not now, not when we are so close. Let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the American people. Let's get it done.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, even as health care reform would reduce our deficit, it's not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves. It's a challenge that makes all others that much harder to solve and one that's been subject to a lot of political posturing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So let me start the discussion of government spending by setting the record straight. At the beginning of the last decade, the year 2000, America had a budget surplus of over $200 billion.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "By -- by the time I took office, we had a one-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade. Most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription drug program.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "On top of that, the effects of the recession put a $3 trillion hole in our budget. All this was before I walked in the door.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now -- just stating the facts. Now, if we had taken office in ordinary times, I would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit. But we took office amid a crisis, and our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another $1 trillion to our national debt. That, too, is a fact.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I'm absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do, but families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions. The federal government should do the same.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So tonight, I'm proposing specific steps to pay for the $1 trillion that it took to rescue the economy last year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Starting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze government spending for three years. Spending related to our national security, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security will not be affected, but all other discretionary government programs will.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Like any cash-strapped family, we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don't. And if I have to enforce this discipline by veto, I will.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We will continue to go through the budget line by line, page by page, to eliminate programs that we can't afford and don't work. We've already identified $20 billion in savings for next year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "To help working families, we'll extend our middle-class tax cuts. But at a time of record deficits, we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies, for investment fund managers, and for those making over $250,000 a year. We just can't afford it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we'll still face the massive deficit we had when I took office. More importantly, the cost of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will continue to skyrocket.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's why I've called for a bipartisan Fiscal Commission, modeled on a proposal by Republican Judd Gregg and Democrat Kent Conrad.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This can't be one of those Washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solved a problem. The commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain deadline.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, yesterday, the Senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission. So I'll issue an executive order that will allow us to go forward, because I refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of Americans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And when the vote comes tomorrow, the Senate should restore the pay-as-you-go law that was a big reason for why we had record surpluses in the 1990s.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, I know that some in my own party will argue that we can't address the deficit or freeze government spending when so many are still hurting. And I agree, which is why this freeze won't take effect until next year, when the economy is stronger. That's how budgeting works.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But understand -- understand, if we don't take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery, all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "From some on the right, I expect we'll hear a different argument, that if we just make fewer investments in our people, extend tax cuts, including those for the wealthier Americans, eliminate more regulations, maintain the status quo on health care, our deficits will go away.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The problem is, that's what we did for eight years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's what helped us into this crisis. It's what helped lead to these deficits. We can't do it again.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Rather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated Washington for decades, it's time to try something new. Let's invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of debt. Let's meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here. Let's try common sense, a novel concept.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, to do that, we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now. We face a deficit of trust, deep and corrosive doubts about how Washington works that have been growing for years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "To close that credibility gap, we have to take action on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, to end the outsized influence of lobbyists, to do our work openly, to give our people the government they deserve.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's what I came to Washington to do. That's why, for the first time in history, my administration posts our White House visitors online. That's why we've excluded lobbyists from policy-making jobs or seats on federal boards and commissions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But we can't stop there. It's time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client with my administration or with Congress. It's time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for federal office.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "With all due deference to separation of powers, last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests or, worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people. And I urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps correct some of these problems.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I'm also calling on Congress to continue down the path of earmark reform, Democrats and Republicans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Democrats and Republicans, you've trimmed some of this spending. You've embraced some meaningful change, but restoring the public trust demands more. For example, some members of Congress post some earmark requests online.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Tonight, I'm calling on Congress to publish all earmark requests on a single Web site before there's a vote so that the American people can see how their money is being spent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Of course, none of these reforms will even happen if we don't also reform how we work with one another. Now, I'm not naive. I never thought that the mere fact of my election would usher in peace and harmony and some post-partisan era.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I knew that both parties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched. And on some issues, there are simply philosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways. These disagreements, about the role of government in our lives, about our national priorities and our national security, they've been taking place for over 200 years. They're the very essence of our democracy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But what frustrates the American people is a Washington where every day is Election Day. We can't wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side, a belief that if you lose, I win. Neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I'm speaking of both parties now. The confirmation of well-qualified public servants shouldn't be held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few individual senators.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Washington may think that saying anything about the other side, no matter how false, no matter how malicious, is just part of the game. But it's precisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the American people. Worse yet -- worse yet, it's sowing further division among our citizens, further distrust in our government.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, no, I will not give up on trying to change the tone of our politics. I know it's an election year. And after last week, it's clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual. But we still need to govern.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "To Democrats, I would remind you that we still have the largest majority in decades and the people expect us to solve problems, not run for the hills.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And if the Republican leadership is going to insist that 60 votes in the Senate are required to do any business at all in this town, a supermajority, then the responsibility to govern is now yours, as well. Just saying no to everything may be good short-term politics, but it's not leadership. We were sent here to serve our citizens, not our ambitions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So let's show the American people that we can do it together.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This week -- this week, I'll be addressing a meeting of the House Republicans. I'd like to begin monthly meetings with both Democratic and Republican leadership. I know you can't wait.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, throughout our history, no issue has united this country more than our security. Sadly, some of the unity we felt after 9/11 has dissipated. And we can argue all we want about who's to blame for this, but I'm not interested in re-litigating the past.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I know that all of us love this country. All of us are committed to its defense. So let's put aside the schoolyard taunts about who's tough. Let's reject the false choice between protecting our people and upholding our values. Let's leave behind the fear and division and do what it takes to defend our nation and forge a more hopeful future, for America and for the world.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's the work we began last year. Since the day I took office, we renewed our focus on the terrorists who threaten our nation. We've made substantial investments in our homeland security and disrupted plots that threatened to take American lives.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We are filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed Christmas attack with better airline security and swifter action on our intelligence. We've prohibited torture and strengthened partnerships from the Pacific to South Asia to the Arabian Peninsula.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And in the last year, hundreds of Al Qaeda's fighters and affiliates, including many senior leaders, have been captured or killed, far more than in 2008.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And in Afghanistan, we're increasing our troops and training Afghan security forces so they can begin to take the lead in July of 2011 and our troops can begin to come home.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We will reward good governance, work to reduce corruption, and support the rights of all Afghans, men and women alike. We're joined by allies and partners who have increased their own commitment and who'll come together tomorrow in London to reaffirm our common purpose. There will be difficult days ahead, but I am absolutely confident we will succeed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As we take the fight to Al Qaeda, we are responsibly leaving Iraq to its people. As a candidate, I promised that I would end this war, and that is what I am doing as president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We will have all of our combat troops out of Iraq by the end of this August.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We will support -- we will support the Iraqi government -- we will support the Iraqi government as they hold elections, and we will continue to partner with the Iraqi people to promote regional peace and prosperity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But make no mistake: This war is ending, and all of our troops are coming home.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Tonight, all of our men and women in uniform -- in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and around the world -- they have to know that we -- that they have our respect, our gratitude, our full support. And just as they must have the resources they need in war, we all have a responsibility to support them when they come home.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's why we made the largest increase in investments for veterans in decades last year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's why we're building a 21st-century [Veterans Affairs]. And that's why Michelle has joined with Jill Biden to forge a national commitment to support military families.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, even as we prosecute two wars, we're also confronting perhaps the greatest danger to the American people, the threat of nuclear weapons. I've embraced the vision of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these weapons and seeks a world without them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "To reduce our stockpiles and launchers, while ensuring our deterrent, the United States and Russia are completing negotiations on the farthest-reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Now, these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of nuclear weapons. That's why North Korea now faces increased isolation and stronger sanctions, sanctions that are being vigorously enforced.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's why the international community is more united and the Islamic Republic of Iran is more isolated. And as Iran's leaders continue to ignore their obligations, there should be no doubt: They, too, will face growing consequences. That is a promise.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's the leadership we are providing: engagement that advances the common security and prosperity of all people. We're working through the G-20 to sustain a lasting global recovery. We're working with Muslim communities around the world to promote science and education and innovation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We have gone from a bystander to a leader in the fight against climate change. We're helping developing countries to feed themselves and continuing the fight against HIV/AIDS.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "That's why, as we meet here tonight, over 10,000 Americans are working with many nations to help the people of Haiti recover and rebuild.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's why we stand with the girl who yearns to go to school in Afghanistan, why we support the human rights of the women marching through the streets of Iran, why we advocate for the young man denied a job by corruption in Guinea, for America must always stand on the side of freedom and human dignity, always.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Abroad, America's greatest source of strength has always been our ideals. The same is true at home. We find unity in our incredible diversity, drawing on the promise enshrined in our Constitution, the notion that we're all created equal, that no matter who you are or what you look like, if you abide by the law, you should be protected by it, if you adhere to our common values, you should be treated no different than anyone else.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Unfortunately, too many of our citizens have lost faith that our biggest institutions -- our corporations, our media, and, yes, our government -- still reflect these same values.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Each of these institutions are full of honorable men and women doing important work that helps our country prosper. But each time a CEO rewards himself for failure or a banker puts the rest of us at risk for his own selfish gain, people's doubts grow.

{"original": "But remember this: I never suggested that change would be easy or that I could do it alone. Democracy in a nation of 300 million people can be noisy and messy and complicated. And when you try to do big things and make big changes, it stirs passions and controversy. That's just how it is.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Those of us in public office can respond to this reality by playing it safe and avoid telling hard truths and pointing fingers. We can do what's necessary to keep our poll numbers high and get through the next election instead of doing what's best for the next generation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But I also know this: If people had made that decision 50 years ago or 100 years ago or 200 years ago, we wouldn't be here tonight.

Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's important to note that the economy has been expanding for a decade, starting under President Barack Obama. And the rate of growth is not any greater for Trump.

And for all these reasons, I say to the people of our great country, and to the Members of Congress before me: The State of our Union is stronger than ever before!", "augmented": []}

We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting high our citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Again, it's debatable that the economy needed reviving when he took office. It's been growing for more than a decade. He did move to cut many regulations — but there are serious environmental impacts for those moves. Further, that tax cut bill, which permanently cut corporate rates and temporarily cut individual rates, has made the national deficit skyrocket to more than $1 trillion per year.

{"original": "While Cohen did not provide any details about the subjects of his testimony, saying only that he wanted to cooperate and provide the American people with answers by providing a full and credible account of the events which have transpired, there are at least three avenues of inquiry that could be pursued by committee members or volunteered by Cohen that could potentially cause President Trump and his three eldest children a whole heap of trouble.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "None of these likely areas relates to topics in the heartland of Mueller's Russia probe, which will be handled by a different committee, likely in secret session, because of the ongoing nature of that investigation.

{"original": "To date, Cohen has said only that Trump directed him to make the payments and that he made the payments for the principal purpose of influencing the election. I expect that we will hear much more specific testimony about how Trump ordered Cohen to pay off these women in exchange for their silence, and Trump's comments establishing the reason behind the payoffs. And we also are likely to learn who else was in on the scheme, both at the Trump Organization and in the campaign.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "All of this information is important because it provides the evidence behind the accusation that Trump was involved. First, Cohen may identify other witnesses to Trump's actions in addition to the two we know have already received immunity for their testimony, namely Allen Weisselberg, Trump Organization CFO, and David Pecker, CEO of AMI, the media company involved in the McDougal payoff.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Cohen may also reveal the existence of other corroborating evidence in addition to what we already know, like the tape recording he famously made of his and Trump's conversations. So, on February 7 we should all have a much fuller picture of the evidence to support the notion that President Trump has committed a felony campaign finance offense. Trump has denied violating the law, though his version of events has changed repeatedly and dramatically since the payoff allegations surfaced.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Second, there is a whole category of evidence that Cohen could provide to Congress regarding possible wrongdoing at the Trump Organization which could spell trouble not only for Trump, but for three of his children who are or have been Trump Organization executives.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Cohen is in the position, having been a high-level Trump Organization executive for 10 years, acting as a lawyer and a fixer, to provide testimony about a whole host of areas, to include tax and accounting matters, issues relating to immigration (note the recent reporting that Trump employees at a New Jersey golf property allegedly provided false documents to illegal workers) and more.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "To be clear, there is not currently in the public realm solid proof of misconduct along these lines by Trump Organization officials, but to the extent such misconduct has occurred, Cohen would almost certainly know about it. President Trump's claims otherwise, for example his statement that Cohen did very low-level work at the Trump Organization, are inconsistent with Cohen's longevity and role in the organization, and with his significant access to Trump.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That said, there are two possible reasons why Cohen may not testify about Trump Organization misdeeds on February 7. It appears that, at least as of the date of his sentencing in December, Cohen refused to cooperate on matters other than the campaign finance crimes with prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, according to SDNY's sentencing submission. This would presumably include information related to potential criminal conduct at the Trump Organization aside from the campaign finance crime.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If the reason for this is that describing such conduct exposes Cohen to additional criminal liability, he may refuse to answer questions about it. There is also a less likely scenario under which Cohen has since sentencing decided to cooperate with an SDNY investigation into the Trump Organization, and that SDNY has asked him not to discuss this ongoing investigation in a public setting.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A final way in which Cohen's testimony could be valuable is in adding evidence to civil actions that are ongoing or anticipated. He may provide more public information on the alleged violations of law committed by the Trump Foundation, currently the subject of a civil action by the New York Attorney General as well as the factual basis for numerous suspected conflicts of interest.", "augmented": []}

Information on what deals the Trump Organization was pursuing in these countries could be very enlightening and helpful to the state attorneys general and good government groups seeking to shine a light on these potential conflicts. Cohen should know; he was still working for Trump, according to Trump, as recently as April 2018.", "augmented": []}

But Volcker's rate hikes and Reagan's corporate tax cuts eventually broke the back of inflation, setting the stage for rapid economic growth. Under Reagan, America drastically ramped up defense spending in a successful bid to bring down the Soviet Union. Despite the strong economy, Wall Street suffered its worst day ever under Reagan. The Dow plunged an astonishing 22.6% on Black Monday — equaling about 5,500 points today.

This clears the way for an invasion by Turkey and leaves behind the Kurdish fighters who fought alongside the U.S. to defeat ISIS. That is incredibly important, we'll get to that in just a moment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Let's go to Capitol Hill. Let's start with our congressional reporter Lauren Fox.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "LAUREN FOX, CNN POLITICS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's right. And that really undercuts the Republican talking point we have heard up here on Capitol Hill, Poppy, that this person, this first whistleblower did not have firsthand knowledge of the phone call that has now become the centerpiece of Democrats' impeachment inquiry. So one of the biggest points about this new whistleblower, of course, is that this person did have firsthand knowledge. Of course, they are working through the whistleblower protection system. That's, of course, very key. Democrats are arguing that this is an important new development.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Meanwhile, Republicans are arguing that basically nothing has changed. And I think that that is going to be the tenor for which we go into this week in which we have two State Department officials coming up to Capitol Hill for closed-doors depositions with three committees, the Oversight Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and, of course, the Foreign Relations Committee. So all of that happening this week.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We have Gordon Sondland coming tomorrow. Then we have the former ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, who's coming on Friday. She will talk to lawmakers behind closed doors.

{"original": "SCIUTTO: And of course those are two officials with firsthand direct knowledge.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCIUTTO: Of the events leading up to that decision.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "So, even though some of the circumstances here are different, again, a firsthand knowledge being one of them, still being dismissed by the administration?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Right. Well, the bottom line from Stephanie Grisham over here at the White House is that the president did nothing wrong, so it doesn't matter how many whistleblowers there are out there. But also important to say the president tweeted just this morning once again, discrediting this second whistleblower. You know he has a history of that, it goes all the way back even before Robert Mueller who he went after with a vengeance. The president this morning writing, The partisan whistleblower, apparently referring to the first whistleblower to come forward, was very wrong. The president writes what his, quote, perfect no pressure call with the Ukrainian president was and then apparently referring to the second person, he writes, Bring in another whistleblower from the bench.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So now you got the president once again going after the first whistleblower, the second whistleblower. We don't know any of their names at all and we can certainly expect this to continue over the weekend as well. The president also referring to an attorney for the whistleblowers as the same for both, and also indicating that that person is a Democrat supporting both Hillary Clinton and Obama. That's apparently -- apparently a reference to attorney Andrew Bakaj who in fact was an intern for Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer, the two New York senators back in 2001. Back to you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HARLOW: All right. Joe Johns, thank you very much for laying all of that out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCIUTTO: Well, 90 former National Security officials who we should note worked for both Republican and Democratic administrations have come together, signed an open letter in support of the first whistleblower. That letter says, and we're quoting, Simply put, he or she has done what our law demands. Now he or she deserves our protection.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Former director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, is one of the officials who signed that letter. He joins me now live from Washington.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Director Clapper, tell us why you and these other officials felt the need to come out publicly in support of this whistleblower's right here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "JAMES CLAPPER, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, Jim, I think it stems first with my involvement with the intelligence community whistleblower protection program when I served as director of National Intelligence and I was a strong proponent of it for the simple reason that people in the intelligence community must have, should have a legitimate conduit for expressing concerns about wrongdoing and be able to do it in such a way that they are protected and the information they are conveying is protected.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So when I was approached about signing such a letter, open letter to the public, about the importance of whistleblowers and the importance of protecting them, I signed on in a heartbeat.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCIUTTO: That's right. As you know, the president has called for this whistleblower to be outed and you've heard it from some of the president's surrogates, Senator Lindsey Graham as well, and I want to play a short comment from him on FOX News and then ask you a question. Have a listen.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "SCIUTTO: Now Senator Graham, as well as you and I, know that the whistleblower law is designed expressly to protect the identity of whistleblowers so they feel secure in coming and exposing the possibility of wrongdoing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Do you see a deliberate effort here by the president and his supporters to discourage future whistleblowers? To make it clear to them that there will be public consequences if they come forward?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLAPPER: Well, yes, absolutely. I think, in fact, the statements such as Senator Graham's and certainly the president's about outing the whistleblower is I think casts -- creates a chilling effect on others to come forward if, in fact, the law is going to be summarily violated. I think that would cause others to pause about coming forward. Now it appears that may not have applied here, which is a good thing in the case of this second whistleblower complainant.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCIUTTO: As you know, the president now has sitting members of this government. You have the attorney general, traveling the world now, meeting with U.S. intelligence partners, trying to find out in his view whether they participated in some sort of Obama administration- led effort to undermine President Trump in the last election here. You also know that John Durham, who is a former prosecutor, senior Justice Department official, he's pursuing his own investigation on the origins of that probe.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "CLAPPER: Well, I don't -- I don't know. I don't think there was any wrongdoing. I think at the time all of us were trying to navigate a very, very difficult, politically fraught, highly charged situation. I know from my part my main concern was -- were the Russians and the threat posed by the Russians to our very political fabric. And the message I'm getting from all this is, apparently what we were supposed to have done was to ignore the Russian interference, ignore the Russian meddling and the threat that it poses to us, and oh, by the way, mulling off what the then commander-in-chief, President Obama, told us to do, which was to assemble all the reporting that we could, that we had available to us, and put it in one report that the president could pass on to the Congress and to the next administration, and while we're at it, declassify as much as we possibly could to make it public and that's what we did. And --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLAPPER: It's kind of disconcerting now to be investigated for, you know, having done our duty and done what we were told to do by the president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCIUTTO: Fair enough. And as you know we're just a little more than a year away from another election which the intelligence community is concerned, and others, Republicans and Democrats concerned that Russia will interfere again, and other officials.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I wonder, as you see the president, as you see the attorney general, as you see, for instance, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee in the Senate, Ron Johnson, talking about all these possible conspiracies in 2016, who's minding the store now for 2020?", "augmented": []}

And those great, you know, men and women of those organizations continue to be vigilant and continue to try to keep the nation safe and secure, particularly as we approach the 2020 election. And I anticipate not only the Russians will be trying to interfere, meddle and influence, but other countries as well who went to school on what the Russians did and the success they enjoyed in 2016.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "HARLOW: OK. We have a lot ahead. Coming up, we'll speak with Congressman Jamie Raskin. He, of course, sits on both the Intelligence and Oversight Committees. Will one or both of the whistleblowers testify? What are they expecting? We'll ask him next. Plus, more on the Trump administration's stunning move overnight, withdrawing troops from northern Syria. What does this mean for the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in the region?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCIUTTO: Well, they're abandoned again. And talks between United Autoworkers Union and General Motors have taken a turn for the worse, according to a chief negotiator.

What is your response to your Republican colleagues who say the president is just joking?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): Well, do they think he was joking when he withheld $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine, and then sent people over there including Rudy Giuliani, to shake them down to extract from them a commitment to investigate Joe Biden to unleash prosecutors and investigators on Joe Biden? Was that a joke too?", "augmented": []}

What is your reaction to Senator Graham saying they have --their identity has to be made public?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "RASKIN: Well, the desperation of some of the Republicans is quite extraordinary at this point. It used to be a bipartisan commitment that we protect whistleblowers because we want them to come forward with the truth of the conduct of our elected officials. But we don't have to depend on just this one whistleblower, not only is there another whistleblower who is about to come forward, but everything that the whistleblower said has been corroborated by independent objective evidence including the contemporaneous transcript of -- or memorandum about the phone call that took place on July 25th between President Trump and President Zelensky.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We also have objective, verifiable evidence that the president's withholding of the military assistance at the same time in order to create coercive leverage over this vulnerable ally resisting Russian aggression. So, everything the whistleblower has said has been objectively borne out by the testimony of other witnesses and more are coming forward every day.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And you can see already the contradiction in what they're saying. On the one hand, they're saying there's absolutely nothing wrong with what they did, as President Trump puts it, it was a perfect call, it was a perfect strategy.

{"original": "HARLOW: Congressman, on the impeachment question, obviously you're leading on this front, and you've said that you think articles of impeachment are inevitable at this point, you said that to our Manu Raju.

{"original": "Those of you who are aged 50 or older have probably been working for a few decades, and you may be thinking about what comes next. Most of us dream of eventually leaving the workforce for good -- but what if you haven't even started saving for retirement yet?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "First off, know you're not alone. In fact, a recent GOBankingrates.com survey found that 28% of people over age 55 have no retirement savings at all, while 26% report that they have under $50,000 saved for retirement.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "If you're in your 50s and still haven't put anything away for your golden years, you should consider working until at least your Social Security full retirement age -- the age at which you can receive the full Social Security benefit you're entitled to based on your work history. The later you retire, the longer you can live on earned income and build up your savings, rather than drawing those savings down in order to get by.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Over the next 10 to 15 years, you'll need to turbocharge your savings. Generally, a savings rate of 15% of gross annual salary is recommended for people who have decades to prepare for retirement. But if you're in your 50s and haven't really been saving, then you need to dig as deep as possible. Ideally, you'll save 30% or more of your salary in order to get your savings on track to meet your needs in retirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you're unable to save that much, then try to start at 15% and look for ways to make small increases over time. For example, every time you get a raise, put it directly toward your savings contributions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now that you know how much you should be saving, let's address where you should be saving. Tax-sheltered retirement accounts can offer you current and future tax benefits. If you have an employer-sponsored 401(k) or 403(b), you can contribute up to $18,000 this year, plus a $6,000 catch-up contribution if you're aged 50 or older, for a total of $24,000. If you can max out your retirement account and possibly earn an employer match, then you'll make up for some lost time.", "augmented": []}

If you're in a position to do so, make sure you reach to get these catch-up contributions in order to bridge the gap between what you have and what you need in savings. In fact, saving the full $6,500 for the next 15 years in an account earning 5% would yield a nest egg of about $150,000.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Look to sources of guaranteed income", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Social Security was never intended to be your only source of retirement income -- or even the primary source.

{"original": "Most employers who offer a 401(k) plan will match at least some of your contributions.

Different employers offer different levels of matching; check with your HR representative to find out what your own company offers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Typically, employers will match your contributions up to a certain amount -- say, 5% of your salary. Once you find out how much your employer will match, make sure you're contributing at least that much each year. If you don't, you're throwing that free money away.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs allow you to contribute money tax-free. With a 401(k), the contributions come out of your paycheck before they're taxed, and with an IRA, you get to deduct your contributions, which means you don't have to pay taxes on that amount. However, you do have to pay taxes when you eventually withdraw the money to pay for expenses in retirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A Roth IRA works the other way around: The money you put into the account is taxed, but when you withdraw it, you don't have to pay taxes on it (assuming you meet all the qualifications). That makes a Roth account ideal for those who are just starting their career, because they're probably earning less now (and therefore paying a lower tax rate) then they will be when they withdraw the money. That means they could save a bundle in income taxes.", "augmented": []}

You won't actually need the money for decades, so it won't matter if your portfolio tanks in value this year; it'll likely rebound in the next. That can lead to some pretty heart-palpitating moments as your investments see-saw up and down, but just grit your teeth and remind yourself that it doesn't matter how much those stocks are worth today; what matters is how much they'll be worth when you approach retirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When you're young, there's nothing wrong with living life spontaneously and occasionally flying by the seat of your pants. But maybe make an exception when it comes to saving money. You don't have to micromanage your investments -- just learn the basics of asset allocation and tweak your holdings about once a year so they don't get out of wack. If a mutual fund you own is going gangbusters, then it will take up a bigger and bigger percentage of your portfolio. If that mutual fund later tanks, you don't want it to drag your portfolio down with it, so do some occasional buying and selling to keep your investments in check.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "When it comes to cost, a basic trust plan may run anywhere from $1,600 to $3,000, or possibly more depending on the complexity of the trust. Such a plan should include the trust setup, a will, a living will and a health-care proxy. You will also pay fees to amend the trust if it's revocable and to administer the trust after you die.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "One caveat: Assets you want protected by the trust must be retitled in the name of the trust. Anything that is not so titled when you die will have to be probated and may not go to the heir you intended but to one the probate court chooses.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For a trust in which you want to put the majority of your assets -- known as a revocable living trust -- you also have to have a pour-over will to cover any of your holdings that might be outside of your trust if you die unexpectedly. A pour-over will essentially directs that any assets outside of the trust at the time of your death be put into it so they can go to the heirs you choose.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "With a credit-shelter trust (also called a bypass or family trust), you write a will bequeathing an amount to the trust up to the estate-tax exemption. Then you pass the rest of your estate to your spouse tax-free. You also specify how you want the trust to be used -- for example, you may stipulate that income from the trust after you die goes to your spouse and that when he or she dies, the principal will be distributed tax-free among your children.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Since your spouse is also entitled to an estate-tax exemption, the two of you can effectively double (or more than double) that portion of your kids' inheritance that is shielded from estate taxes by using this strategy.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Of course, you can pass an amount equal to the estate-tax exemption directly to your kids when you die, but the reason for a bypass trust is to protect your spouse financially in the event he or she has need for income from the trust or in the event you think your children will squander their inheritance before the surviving parent dies.", "augmented": []}

In order for the trust to be valid, you must outlive it, and then either move out of your home or pay your children fair market rent to continue living there, Janko says. While that may not seem ideal, the upside is that the rent you pay will reduce your estate further, Levine notes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "An irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT) can remove your life insurance from your taxable estate, help pay estate costs, and provide your heirs with cash for a variety of purposes. To remove the policy from your estate, you surrender ownership rights, which means you may no longer borrow against it or change beneficiaries. In return, the proceeds from the policy may be used to pay any estate costs after you die and provide your beneficiaries with tax-free income.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That can be useful in cases where you leave heirs an illiquid asset such as a business. The business might take a while to sell, and in the meantime your heirs will have to pay operating expenses.

{"original": "One nit worth picking is that Darvish does give up a lot of home runs. But his strikeout habit isn't the only thing he has to downplay that.

{"original": "As for Darvish's postseason track record, it's a bad look that he has a 5.81 ERA in six career October starts. It's a worse look that he got absolutely shelled in the two starts he made for the Los Angeles Dodgers in last year's World Series.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But according to Tom Verducci of Sports Illustrated, that may have been because Darvish was tipping his pitches. Assuming he's learned his lesson, he's not necessarily doomed to additional October struggles.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Even before the Cubs signed Darvish, it was possible to have faith in Lester and Hendricks bouncing back and combining with Quintana and Chatwood to form one of MLB's best starting rotations in 2018.

{"original": "I'm 48 years old and would like to retire by the time I'm 55. What do I need to do make that happen? -- V.M.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Many people dream of making an early exit from the work-a-day routine. But making that dream a reality can be a challenge. The reason is simple. By retiring at 55 instead of, say, 65, you not only have 10 fewer years of saving and investing to build a nest egg, that nest egg also has to support you through an extra 10 years of retirement. That double-whammy of fewer working years to save and more retirement years to spend is what makes early retirement so tough to pull off.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But while calling it a career a good decade before you reach a more traditional retirement age may be daunting, it's not impossible. It will, however, take some serious, disciplined planning. Here are the four most important things you should do to improve your chances of success.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "1. Ramp up your savings rate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "To maintain an acceptable lifestyle throughout a retirement that could last upwards of 40 years, you're going to need a sizable savings stash to support you. For example, let's say that in addition to the income you'll eventually receive from Social Security and any other sources, you'll need an inflation-adjusted $50,000 a year from savings in order to maintain your standard of living in retirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "To have a reasonable shot at being able to pull that amount from savings year after year without too high a risk of running out of money too soon, you'll likely need a savings stash somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 to 35 times the annual income you wish to withdraw, or in this example a nest egg of roughly $1.5 million to $1.8 million.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You can get by with a much smaller nest egg, of course, if you'll be depending on it for significantly less income. But the point is that to accumulate enough savings during your working years to support yourself over an extra long retirement, you're going to have to do some heavy-duty saving.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Related: How much can I expect to earn on my retirement savings?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The savings rate you should shoot for will depend on how much you've managed to tuck away already, how many years you have until you retire and how much income you'll need your nest egg to generate. But the standard recommendation of 15% or so a year isn't likely to do it. To have a realistic chance of throwing off the shackles of your 9-to-5 in your mid-50s, you may have to have to sock away upwards of 25% to 30% a year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You can get a decent estimate of what sort of savings effort will be required by going to a good retirement income calculator and plugging in the age at which you hope to retire, the amount you already have saved and how income you think you'll need when you retire. By running several scenarios with different savings rates, you should be able to come away with a sense of how much you'll need to ratchet up your savings rate to have a reasonable shot at success.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "2. Get a handle on your retirement expenses.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Many people assume their expenses will drop once they retire, but that's not necessarily true. Indeed, a 2015 study that examined changes in household spending in retirement found that nearly half of retirees actually spent more after leaving their jobs, at least in the initial years after retiring. So if want to accurately gauge whether you'll have enough income to cover your retirement living costs if you leave your job early, you need to have a realistic fix on what you're actually likely to spend.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Related: The best way to get guaranteed income in retirement", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The best way to do that is to create a detailed retirement budget. There are a number of free online interactive budgeting tools out there, but I like BlackRock's Retirement Expense Worksheet because it easily allows you to enter some 50 different expenses in eight broad categories. The worksheet also separates essential living expenses (housing, food, etc.) from discretionary ones (travel, entertainment, hobbies) so you can easily see how much room you'll have to cut expenses if necessary in the future without eliminating necessary expenditures.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Don't worry if you're not certain what your eventual retirement expenses will be. Do the best you can for now, and then make sure to update and refine your estimates as you get closer to your planned departure date.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For many people aspiring to retire early, getting and maintaining health insurance can be a major stumbling block. The reason: You're not eligible for Medicare until you hit 65. So if you retire before that date and don't have coverage through a former employer (or, if you're married, through a spouse's current or former employer), you'll have to buy health care coverage on your own. That can be a budget wrecker, which is why it's imperative you have a good idea of what the tab for health insurance will be before you actually leave your job.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Related: 3 things to know about health savings accounts", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Unfortunately, estimating what you'll pay for health insurance in the years ahead is a bit of a guessing game at the moment, what with the effort to repeal and replace Obamacare still a work in progress. But you can at least get a sense of what you might need to budget for coverage now by going to sites like eHealthInsurance.com and HealthPocket.com. You can then re-visit these sites as more details about health insurance costs emerge.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But make no mistake. You shouldn't even think of pulling the trigger on early retirement unless you're confident you'll have the resources to cover the cost of medical insurance as well as your potential health care costs overall.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Lifestyle planning, or thinking seriously about how you actually want to spend your time once you leave your job behind, is an important part of any retirement plan. It's especially crucial, however, if you're contemplating early retirement. After all, by retiring early you could easily be looking at a post-career life that will last as long, if not longer, than your career. Thus, if for no other reason than to avoid boredom or the feeling that you're just marking time, you'll want to do all you can to make this stage of your life rewarding and fulfilling.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Research shows that retirees who have a wide circle of friends tend to be happier in retirement. So in the years leading up your planned exit date, you'll want to consider a variety of ways to remain socially connected, such as reconnecting with old friends, making an effort to stay in touch with colleagues from work and even cultivating a new network of friends and acquaintances, say, by volunteering at a local charity or enrolling in adult-education classes. Starting a new hobby or throwing yourself into a new project --writing a book, launching a blog, learning a new language or musical instrument, etc.-- can also help engender a sense of purpose during a lengthy retirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Related: How to retire if you're going to live to 100", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Lifestyle planning can also help with the financial side of preparing for your early retirement, as the way you live in retirement can directly affect how much you'll spend and thus how large a nest egg you'll require. So as you're working on your retirement budget and gauging how much you need to save, you'll want to think about such issues as whether you plan to travel a lot or stick close to home and whether you intend to remain in your current house or downsize to smaller, less expensive digs in an effort to free up home equity and lower housing costs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's also important to remember that some lifestyle decisions have both social and financial dimensions. For example, choosing to work part-time can not only be a good way to earn a few extra bucks and reduce withdrawals from your nest egg, but an effective strategy for remaining socially engaged.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Clearly, there are other topics you'll have to address as you prepare to make your early exit. You'll want to be sure you're following a consistent investing strategy that jibes with your tolerance for risk, balances growth and downside protection and keeps expenses to a minimum. If you won't have enough savings in taxable accounts to fund the initial years of your retirement, then you'll also want to look into ways of tapping tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA while avoiding or minimizing early-withdrawal penalties. And you'll want to monitor your progress as you near your planned retirement date to gauge whether leaving your job at 55 is still realistic or whether you might be better off delaying a year or two.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But this much is certain: The sooner you create a plan and put it into action, the better the chance your early retirement dream will become a reality.", "augmented": []}

Daley.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In 1970, Madigan was elected to the Illinois House, where he has served ever since.

{"original": "The year Madigan first became speaker also was the first year of the  Cutback Amendmen t , a voter-approved state constitutional amendment which created single-member House districts and reduced the size of the chamber by one-third.

{"original": "Governors both Republican and Democrat have acknowledged Madigan as the real power in Illinois politics -- through his ability to singularly control the fate of legislation and dictate the vote of his members being key to any politician's agenda. He would quash measures sought by Chicago mayors until he was able to extract concessions in return or punish them if they weren't offered. He made the local share of the state income tax temporary so that Mayor Richard M. Daley had to come back to him for help, allowing him to extract more from Daley.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Madigan also is a property tax assessment attorney, which has proved to be a lucrative business. In addition to representing major city businesses in appealing property taxes, getting a cut of any reduction, business leaders also know of Madigan's clout and offer property tax business as recognition.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Madigan also has further concentrated his power by holding the position of chairman of the Illinois Democratic Party, a post he was elected to in 1998. But unlike other states' party organizations which strive to be publicly active and take a role in national affairs, Madigan cared little about national politics -- even before Illinois turned into a reliably Democratic state on the presidential scene. Instead, he used the party as a closed operation to help further his Democratic majorities in areas that had been traditionally Republican -- such as the suburban collar counties which surround Chicago and Cook County.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "But Madigan has also lasted because of his ability to change. At one time, citing his Roman Catholic faith, Madigan was opposed to abortion and his ideology could be viewed almost as a Blue Dog centrist-to-conservative Democrat. But with his ability to adapt, Madigan eventually oversaw progressive legislation making Illinois a leader in abortion rights, one of the first states to enact same-sex marriage before the US Supreme Court ruled and the 11th state to legalize recreational adult use of marijuana.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Cillizza: Has Madigan ever faced a real threat to his power? When and why?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Pearson: Previously, the only threat Madigan faced to his power, aside from the two years when Republicans held the Illinois House, came under Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich and recently defeated one-term Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Blagojevich sought to build alliances with then-Democratic Illinois Senate President Emil Jones to try to advance his agenda, though it was widely viewed as damaging to the state's economy and unaffordable. Blagojevich would tell Jones that no one viewed him as a power or respected him as Senate president because Madigan was widely regarded as the power in Illinois. This created tensions between Madigan and Jones, and Madigan ultimately used the House to kill off most of Blagojevich's ill-conceived initiatives. Those feelings were beneath the obvious issues that included trying to shake down a children's hospital and sell a US Senate seat that led to Blagojevich's eventual impeachment, removal from office and federal conviction.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Under Rauner, a wealthy equity investor, Madigan faced his toughest battles. Rauner used his cash to bankroll Republican legislative candidates, using ads calling Madigan corrupt and blaming Madigan for all of the perceived ills that had befallen Illinois. Rauner also backed a pro-business, anti-union agenda that sought to weaken one of Madigan's greatest sources of financial support — organized labor.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The ideological clash between the two led to Illinois going two years without a state budget with government funded through court orders that far outstripped available cash. Ultimately, Madigan won support from some Republicans for a budget and income tax increase in an attempt to repair the wreckage caused to social service agencies and places like Illinois colleges and universities.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Bush, Gore kick off fall campaign season with appeal to working families Candidates trade jabs over debate schedule NAPERVILLE, Illinois (CNN) -- The major presidential candidates kicked off the fall campaign season Monday with appeals to working Americans as they again accused each other of ducking presidential debates. Democratic nominee Al Gore marked Labor Day with unionized workers during a round-the-clock campaign blitz and Republican rival George W. Bush touted his tax-cut plan while stumping through Midwestern states Monday. As we come down to the stretch, we're ready for the contest. We feel great about our chances, Bush said during a rally Monday in Naperville, Illinois. Bush and his running mate, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, arrived in the GOP-friendly Chicago suburb early Monday to take part in the town's Labor Day parade. The duo then parted ways, with Bush heading to Romeo, Michigan, for the state's annual peach festival and Cheney attending a Polish food fair in Chicago. Deadlocked in the polls with Gore, Bush plans to visit nine cities this week in Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Indiana and Ohio -- states that represent 107 electoral votes, and which polls indicate are up for grabs.

It's time to get rid of all those words like 'no controlling legal authority.' Gore used the phrase to defend the practice of making telephone fund-raising calls from his White House office during the 1996 presidential campaign. The vice president charged the calls to a private credit card, and said there was no controlling legal authority that forbid raising political donations from government property. Bush focused on familiar stump themes such as education and military readiness during his Labor Day speech, and described his across-the-board tax-cut proposals as aimed at helping working-class families. The surplus doesn't exist because of the ingenuity and hard work of the federal government. The surplus exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American working people, Bush said, countering Gore claims that his 10-year, $1.3 trillion plan is too costly. He said that Gore's targeted tax cut proposals, aimed at helping low- and middle-class Americans through deductions for education, health care, and child care expenses, would likely by forgotten after the November election. If you remember in 1992, they said give us a chance, we will have targeted tax cuts for the middle class. And now they have to say it again, Bush said.

When asked about the exchange, Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said that Bush comment was meant to be a whispered aside to his running mate. It was not intended to be a public comment. Gore rallies steel workers Gore continued a six-day, 27-hour frenzy of campaigning designed to reach out to core Democratic supporters with a pitch to union workers during an outdoor rally in Pittsburgh. Continuing his populist message, Gore renewed his pledge to raise the minimum wage, build more public schools, secure passage of a patients' bill of rights and provide prescription drug coverage for seniors under the government's Medicare program. Speaking to thousands of steelworkers, Gore tried to label Bush's tax-cut plans as a boon for the wealthiest Americans. What it all comes down to is whether or not we're going to fight for those who most need the help, Gore told the cheering crowd. Also on hand at the rally were civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and AFL-CIO leader John Sweeney.

It's the final stop on a non-stop tour that began yesterday in Philadelphia. After late night stop in Michigan, Gore and running mate Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut arrived in Florida in the pre-dawn hours of Monday. The vice president headed to an all-night coffee shop to chat with waitresses while Lieberman visited a bakery. We decided that in the wee hours of Labor Day ... we'd reconnect with our roots, Gore told a dawn rally. It was very moving for me. Gore and Lieberman later had breakfast with firefighters at a Hispanic neighborhood fire station in one of the city's busiest districts. This crowd is a crowd that looks like America, said Gore. As Gore headed for Pittsburgh, Lieberman returned to Michigan to attend a Labor Day festival in Detroit. If you ever wondered whether Michigan is central to what happens in this election, I've been here three times in the last week and twice in the last 10 hours, Lieberman told cheering union workers.

Bush or what is best for Al Gore. It's about what's best for the American people, said Gore, who argued that commission debates will reach the widest possible viewing audience. Under the Bush camp's proposals, presidential debates would take place on NBC's Meet the Press, hosted by Tim Russert, and CNN's Larry King Live. The third would be hosted by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which has organized the quadrennial face-offs since 1988. On Monday, the Bush campaign emphasized that Gore, regarded by many as a skilled and seasoned debater, had already accepted the CNN and NBC offers among dozens of others. My opponent said he would debate me anyplace, anytime, anywhere, Bush said. I said, 'Fine. Why don't we just show up ... and discuss our differences?' All of a sudden the words 'anytime, anywhere' don't mean anything. In addition to the three debates featuring the presidential candidates, Bush's campaign proposed two between their running mates.

{"original": "BLITZER: And what would be the People's Liberation Army, the Chinese military, how presumably, will they respond to that kind of stuff?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SHAMBAUGH: I doubt that they would challenge and intercept the flights, certainly not in as provocative a way as they apparently have been doing. If they were escorted, I think they would stay some ways away, but you know, it's really unpredictable. It's hard to say.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BLITZER: Are the Chinese -- is the Chinese leadership firmly convinced, as they say they are, that it was the U.S. fault for this collision?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SHAMBAUGH: Well, there is some evidence that this is the story that the Chinese military told the Chinese leadership, indeed that the local Guangdong Chinese military region sent up the line. And once the Chinese leadership received that story, they put it out to their own people and to the world. And once you do that, you can't back down. Now they obviously have diametrically opposed information from the American side.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BLITZER: And some speculation the Chinese may even ask the U.S. for reparations for the family?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "BLITZER: How in the big picture will all this affect U.S.- Chinese relations in the short term?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SHAMBAUGH: Well, in the short term, I think it's going to leave a lot of scar tissue, if you want to call it that, on the relationship. Both sides were deeply suspicious of each other going into these last two weeks. Now I think the suspicions have hardened a bit, and we have Taiwan arms sales decisions coming up shortly and a number of other really very sensitive and delicate questions in the relationship. So, right now, it is a very fragile and suspicious time.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "BLITZER: So, do you have a message to them right now, what you want to see them do as these negotiation begin on Wednesday in Beijing, how to avoid these kinds of collision down the road?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ROBERTSON: Well, I'm a friend of China, but the Chinese must realize that they can't lay claim to the entire South China Sea, that they don't have hegemony all the way to Japan, that they don't own the Spratley islands, et cetera. And that the United States has a perfect right to patrol off the coast there in international waters, and they can't keep us from doing it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The big thing is they must understand the United States has no hostile intentions toward China whatsoever, but we do have to monitor North Korea and we do have to protect our vital interests.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BLITZER: You know, some of the conservatives write -- like Bill Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard here in Washington -- insist that the Bush administration, in effect, allowed the United States to be humiliated with the letter, the expression of regrets, the very sorry twice reference. You don't necessarily agree with Bill Kristol?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ROBERTSON: No, I really don't. I mean, listen, I've been over to China a number of times. I have some activity there and I have some spiritual activity in China, and, Wolf, there are 80 million Christians in China right now. There is a tremendous religious revival, and I have seen an emerging middle class come on in China that ultimately is going to win the day.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Granted, there are some old people that are still in power that look back to a previous age, but there's just too much that has been said in place by Deng Xiaoping that can't be reversed. And so, I think we need to encourage that, not stifle it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BLITZER: How do you balance your historic support for closer relation with China, improved trade relations with China, with what many conservatives complain about, specifically the so-called forced abortions in China?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ROBERTSON: Well, you know, I don't agree with it. But at the same time, they've got 1.2 billion people, and they don't know what to do. If every family over there was allowed to have three or four children, the population would be completely unsustainable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Right now, they run the risk of a tremendous unemployment. There are some antiquated factories that the government owns that have to be shut down that is going to put hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people out of work. And the leadership is like on a teeter-totter board, they can fall off if the population gets too restive.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, I think that right now they're doing what they have to do. I don't agree with the forced abortion, but I don't think the United States needs to interfere with what they're doing internally in this regard.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BLITZER: But in effect, won't your critics on the right be saying that Pat Robertson is justifying abortions in China?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ROBERTSON: Well, I just think they need to get involved in what's happening.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But I'll tell you what the Chinese are doing, and it's going to be a demographic catastrophe. When they're having abortions, they're picking the girl babies for the slaughter, and they're allowing only the males to be born. And in another, say, 10 or 20 years, there's going to be a critical shortage of wives. The young men won't have any women to marry, so it will, in a sense, dilute the -- what they consider the racial purity of the Han Chinese.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And that to them will be a great tragedy, because then they will have to be importing wives from Indonesia and others countries in order to fill up the population.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BLITZER: Some also said that you're letting China off the hook too easily. They're pointing to what you said the other day on LARRY KING LIVE in the midst of the standoff. Let me read to you one of the statements that you did say then: What we ought to do is to say this was a wind draft, and blame it on the wind. Say it's an unfortunate thing. Find some fig leaf that both sides can put on and get on with life. It is too important to both countries to continue some sort of comity to blow it up on the basis of this one plane.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And the argument is that you're letting the Chinese simply off the hook?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ROBERTSON: Wolf, I believe that's what it was. The pilot's name, interestingly enough, was Wang Wei. I mean, of all the ironies, Wang Wei, and he was a hot-dog pilot, and he crashed their plane. But the Chinese, in order to save face, don't want to admit it. So why not blame it on the wind, say it was a wind sheer? And then, both countries can continue their business, and we get our plane back, we get our pilots and our crew back, and we can continue some sort of a relationship.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I think to blow this incident into a potential war would be tragic, and that is what could happen.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BLITZER: What kind of grade would you give President Bush for his first 100 days in office?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ROBERTSON: I would say a B-plus, A-minus, something like that. I think he's done quite well in most of the issues.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BLITZER: One of the issues that you've had some complaints about, some problems is the so-called faith-based initiative that he's put forward that would allow federal tax dollars to go to various religious organizations to provide social services. Do you still have a serious problem with that still?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ROBERTSON: Wolf, I agree with the concept. It's a wonderful, noble concept that faith-based organization should have the same treatment as secular organizations. I mean, that goes without saying. They do a superb job.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The problem is the implementation. If the government forces these faith-based institutions to give up their unique distinctives and no longer preach the Gospel or read the Bible or have prayer or use spiritual counseling, if that's denied them, then of course the government will ruin the organizations.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So I just want to make sure that they're protected and I'm not sure that the Bush administration has fully thought through all the ramifications of current federal law in that regard.", "augmented": []}

And if you overextend yourself financially to buy that house, it may end up being a pretty lousy investment.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Setting aside a reasonable chunk of your income on a regular basis can reap huge rewards for you. First, buying investments that have decades to grow will get you an enormous return thanks to compound interest. Second, having a savings account with a few months' worth of expenses can spare you from having to rely on credit cards during emergencies, which means you'll save a fortune on interest and other debt-related charges. And third, having money saved up gives you more flexibility in your lifestyle choices. For example, if you want to pursue a career in a field that has great earning potential in the future but pays very little today, having some cushion in the bank will make it a lot safer and easier to go for the dream job.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "If you just stick all your money in your savings account, your bank will love you -- but inflation will eat away at that money over time until you have nothing left. Because inflation averages about 3% over the long term, you need to make at least a 3% return on your money just to break even.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And it's safe to say that there is no savings account in existence that pays 3% interest.

Then direct the rest toward retirement and/or brokerage account investments.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As a quick example, if you left $10,000 in a savings account paying 1% interest for 20 years, you'd end up with $12,202. If you left that same $10,000 in a tax-deferred retirement account that earned an average of 7% annually for 20 years, you'd have $38,697.", "augmented": []}

That question, which sounds like the plot for some second-rate geopolitical thriller, was on everybody's lips this past weekend after a pair of bombshell stories from The New York Times and The Washington Post. The Times reported that law enforcement officials became so concerned about President Trump's behavior after he fired ex-FBI Director James Comey that the FBI started an investigation into whether Trump was secretly working on Russia's behalf.", "augmented": []}

In case you're wondering, no, that's not normal behavior for a US President. The White House called the stories inaccurate, without ever pointing out specifically what was not right about the articles. But here's the craziest thing. Trump was asked the question directly by Fox News host Jeanine Pirro. He said that was the most insulting thing he'd ever been asked. But he didn't say no and that just lit up the Twitterverse.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "MOORE: First of all, I like him as a human being. I think he's a very decent and honorable person. I trust him. He seems very down to earth. And I like where he comes from.

And the rich are going to have to pay an extra 5 percent.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "President Trump promised last week that he would present his new tax reform plan on Wednesday.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Actually, it's more likely to be a preview of his plan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "(LATEST NEWS: Trump to propose 15% top business tax rate)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In the wake of Trump's promise, the White House walked back expectations that a comprehensive plan would be ready. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has only said that more details of the plan will be revealed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In any case, what the White House does put out tomorrow will offer some guideposts to where Trump will start negotiations with tax writers on the Hill, who have been busy for months working on their own tax reform proposals.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So here's what to look for.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "1. Just how different will Trump's new guidelines be?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The president already put out broad outlines for tax reform at least twice on the campaign trail. In them he called for much lower tax rates for businesses and individuals and tax simplification.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Trump also outlined how much he'd like to cut rates. In the most recent iteration he proposed reducing the number of tax brackets for individuals from seven to just three: 12%, 25% and 33%.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He also proposed lowering the top tax rate for all businesses -- both corporations and so-called pass-throughs -- to 15%.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Yesterday, White House sources suggested he may come out tomorrow and again call for a 15% corporate tax rate, although no mention was made of a rate cut for so-called pass-through businesses, which include everything from small businesses to big law firms and investment partnerships.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "2. Will he call for real tax reform or just tax cuts?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Tax cuts are easy. Comprehensive, permanent tax reform is hard, because it would restructure the tax code and involve tough political tradeoffs to pay for any tax cuts that might be proposed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Given that nearly half the year is over and progress has been slow, getting comprehensive reform done in 2017 is virtually impossible.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So the question is will Trump simply propose tax cuts, with promises to do real reform later?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And if he opts for tax cuts, how will he propose paying for them? What tradeoffs, if any, is he willing to make? Experts have already thrown cold water on assertions from Mnuchin that Trump's tax plan will be paid for by economic growth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If Trump doesn't mind adding substantially to deficits, that will undercut efforts by Republican leaders in Congress to make the changes permanent because of complicated legislative rules.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The concern for deficit hawks, meanwhile, is that if tax cuts add a lot to the country's debt, that could end up hurting growth and making it that much harder to put the country on a sustainable fiscal path.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "3. Will Trump kill chances for a border adjustment tax?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "House Republicans' tax reform proposal would be paid for in large part by a so-called border adjustment tax, which would fundamentally alter how imports and exports are taxed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The idea has divided the business community. A large swath is vociferously opposed, arguing it will hurt American consumers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And the president has hardly given the BAT much of an endorsement. He's suggested he'd prefer something different that would tax imports, and even mentioned something called a reciprocal tax without much explanation as what a reciprocal tax is or how it would work.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Policy observers will look to his outline on Wednesday to see if it includes a BAT at all -- and if so, how it would be structured differently than the BAT proposed by the House GOP.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "4. Will he focus first on corporate tax cuts?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Some have suggested that Trump and Congress do reform piecemeal, and focus on corporate tax reform first.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If that's what Trump proposes, expect big pushback from pass-through entities, which make up the majority of U.S. businesses. While they use many of the same tax breaks as corporations, they are taxed through the individual tax code, where the top rate is 39.6%.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Small businesses, which include a lot of pass-throughs, worry that Congress will reduce their tax breaks to pay for lower corporate tax rates, but won't lower the top rate for pass through owners and shareholders much, if at all.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "5. What's in it for the middle class?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Mnuchin has said repeatedly that a top priority of Trump's tax plan will be tax relief for the middle class.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "On the campaign trail, Trump talked about big tax cuts for everyone, though distributional analyses of his proposals showed the top 1% would benefit the most by far.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It will also be interesting to see whether Trump's new outline will call for tax breaks to help families with child care costs. Late in the campaign he proposed two, but an independent analysis found that such breaks -- coupled with a few other of Trump's tax proposals -- could unintentionally raise taxes on millions of low- to middle-income families.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Netanyahu slammed the latest investigation, in which a member of his inner circle has been arrested, while denying any involvement in the case. It comes less than a week after police said they had enough evidence to indict Netanyahu on charges of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust in two corruption cases and hours after members of his inner circle were arrested.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "In late 2015, the suspects approached Judge Hila Gerstel, offering to make her attorney general in exchange for inquiring about her position regarding investigations of Sara Netanyahu, the wife of the Israeli Prime Minister. No agreement ever materialized. Gerstel approached Supreme Court Justice Esther Hayut, explaining what had happened, but Hayut, in a statement, said she never passed on the information because Gerstel left out key details.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Details of the latest case come from Hayut's statement as well as a police statement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Although police didn't identify the suspects, Netanyahu named one of the two as Nir Hefetz, his former family spokesperson.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "A lawyer for Hefetz denied all the allegations against him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Hefetz was arrested in a separate case revealed one day earlier, known locally as Case 4000, on suspicion of bribery and obstruction of justice.

{"original": "In recent weeks, Alsheich has come under attack from Netanyahu, who has accused the investigation of harboring conspiracy theories driven by media pressure. In a Facebook post earlier his month, he said police investigators believe ludicrous thoughts, and that they can no longer work in an objective manner.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The attacks have increased following a police statement last week that they have enough evidence to indict Netanyahu on corruption charges in two separate investigations. Netanyahu has said a shadow has fallen under the police investigation, and insisted the police cases have holes like Swiss cheese.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Alsheich appeared to take issue with Netanyahu's increasing attacks coming on social media. In the age of internet, the opportunities are endless. The ability to transmit information is infinite. Every action which can be presented as a mistake by police officers becomes the potential for a media campaign against the police, Alsheich said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Defending the work of police investigators, Alsheich added, We don't want to be on the left side, on the right side. We want to be on the side of the law.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Netanyahu still has the support of key coalition partners, who have said they will wait for the Attorney General to make a decision about whether or not to indict the Prime Minister, which could take months. One key partner, Education Minister Naftali Bennett, did say that Netanyahu was not acting up to the standards of his office.", "augmented": []}

It's an incredibly difficult job, maybe the second hardest in the world, and we need a Prime Minister who is focused on this. In a democracy, the way to change the government is in the polls but I don't think he can give the country the attention it needs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Everyone understands there is a problem running the country because the PM is so pre-occupied with his own problems, Lapid added.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Lapid, a witness in one of the cases against Netanyahu, served as Finance Minister when investigators said Netanyahu tried to advance a bill that would have provided tax benefits to a friend.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Former Vice President Joe Biden responded to questions from Fortune and Time's Up via email. The following transcript of that exchange has been edited for length and clarity.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Fortune/Time's Up: Do you believe that the United States should have comprehensive paid family and medical leave, and if so, what is your proposal to make it happen?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Biden: Absolutely. When I lost my first wife and baby daughter in a car accident, I became a single parent to my two young sons. I've taken care of aging parents. I know how hard it is to raise a family, and what it's like to take care of a sick family member. American workers deserve to know they can keep their families afloat if they have to take care of a sick family member.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's time for our federal government to get its priorities straight, so that workers can care for the people they love when they need it most. I was proud to fight for the Family and Medical Leave Act, landmark legislation that created important workplace protections and granted 12 weeks of [unpaid] leave to working families. But we need to go further—I believe the United States should guarantee 12 weeks of paid sick and family leave for workers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I support the coverage and protections in Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand's (D-N.Y.) FAMILY Act, which recognizes that workers need paid time off to care for newborns or newly adopted children, to take care of themselves or family members with serious health conditions, or to care for military family members and help them prepare for deployments. And it won't just help some workers. Part-time workers, independent contractors, workers who change jobs, and workers at small employers will be able to take the time they need, too. Instead of instituting a payroll tax on employers and employees like the FAMILY Act does, I will pay for this proposal by returning the estate tax to 2009 levels.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "One of the highlights of my career as a public servant has been standing with survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault; they shouldn't be left behind here either. As President, I will guarantee paid leave for survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking who need time to seek physical or mental care, seek counsel, find new housing, or take other action related to the violence they experienced.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "How will you ensure that families who need it have access to safe, affordable childcare?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Ensuring that every family has access to safe, affordable childcare is one of the best things we can do for working parents. Everywhere I go, I meet people who say they can't afford childcare. When I'm President, parents will get up to $8,000 in tax credits to offset the cost of childcare. All 3- and 4-year-olds will be able to attend high-quality, universal prekindergarten at no cost, and after-school programs and community centers will have additional funding to serve kids when school isn't in session.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Do you think institutions—from Congress to Fortune 500 companies—have done enough to address sexual harassment? What have you done, and what will you do, to prevent and address sexual harassment in the workplace?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Women need to feel safe no matter what. No matter where they are—at home, at school, at work, and in their communities. I have spent my entire career fighting for women's safety, starting in 1990, when I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. At the time, domestic violence was considered a private family matter. Because of that landmark legislation, and countless survivors who have spoken out, that is no longer the case today. Women who face violence at home or on campus know that they are not alone—that they have a way forward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I'm proud of what our nation has done to reduce sexual violence, and as President, I'll double down on those efforts to make sure that women are safe at work. First, I'll push Congress to pass the BE HEARD Act. This bill takes a comprehensive approach to workplace harassment. It holds all employers accountable. It funds research so we better understand how to stop harassment in the workplace from the get-go. And, it closes loopholes so that all workers—not just some—are protected.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Second, I'll protect domestic workers from harassment and discrimination by passing the National Domestic Workers Bill of Rights, so that these workers, many of whom are women or people of color, are not left behind, and instead are treated with dignity and respect.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Third, I'll end mandatory arbitration clauses imposed by employers on workers so that workers who experience harassment can have their day in court.

{"original": "The president himself pushed former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to follow through on his plan, according to a source. Why? In part to retaliate against Democrats who opposed his border wall.", "augmented": []}

But the president's worst impulses, his most autocratic and, you know, vengeful impulses.

None have been sent by Stephen Miller, according to The Post, but his name is associated with this. He is thought to be behind some of these notions. And now, more powerful than ever on the issue of immigration.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "AVLON: He has been empowered by the president. He is trying to systematically purge, apparently, policy opponents inside the organization. Again, that word purge. Not one noticeably used in American politics for administrations' on staffers, but that's the degree of the ideological divide.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's the degree of the impulse to say, Break the law on my behalf to punish my political enemies. These are not sentences we say very often in American history. It's happening right now on our watch.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "I heard about it again today here in Nogales. On Tuesday, 4,300 people came across our border illegally along the Southern border in its entirety. The vast majority of those people were families and unaccompanied minors, begin driven by human traffickers and drug cartels that are exploiting these vulnerable families, and they're exploiting loopholes in our laws.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BASH: We have information that the president has been talking about reinstating the zero tolerance policy. Can you vow, standing here at the border, that family separation will never be reinstated?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PENCE: The president made it very clear this week we're not rethinking bringing back family separation. But it's absolutely essential to end a humanitarian crisis that really threatens the security of the American people and is creating hardship on both sides of our border. Congress needs to act.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BASH: The president tweeted last night the following: I think what the Democrats are doing with the border is TREASONOUS, all caps. Their open-border mindset is putting our country at risk. We'll not let that happen.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I know you generally say that the president has his own style of talking, but to to use the word treason, which is supposed to be punished by death, how do you get from that rhetoric to the kind of working across the aisle that you're talking about that's needed to fix things here?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PENCE: I think what you hear the president expressing is the frustration of the American people. That last month alone, more than 100,000 people came across our southern border illegally.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BASH: I just have to ask you about the mayor of South Bend, Pete Buttigieg. He said, I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand that, if you've got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "BASH: Julian Assange. I want to ask you about something that Mike Pompeo, when he was the CIA director, said. He called WikiLeaks a non-state house (ph) intelligence service, often abetted by state actors like Russia. Do you agree with that characterization?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PENCE: Yes, we strongly agree with that. That's why the Justice Department is now seeking extradition. And we're going to bring Julian Assange to justice.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Look, we're working with Chelsea Manning. Julian Assange was involved in one of the greatest compromises of classified information in American history. It literally put American military personnel at risk, and we'll hold him to account in the American justice system.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BASH: What about what he did in 2016? The president, when he was a candidate, welcomed seeing WikiLeaks and the information that they got from Hillary Clinton. Has that changed?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PENCE: Well, I think the president always, as you in the media do, always welcomes information. That was in no way an endorsement.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "But what ahead now for Julian Assange, always a man not to be afraid of the spotlight? Ell, certainly, he has to face a sentencing hearing here in London in probably the next weeks ahead because of the bail he skipped out on here when he hid inside the embassy back in 2012.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And then on May the 2nd, most likely after he's sentenced, he'll have an extradition hearing. That is to face this indictment in the United States, which specifies that he worked with Chelsea Manning to try and crack part of a password that would have enabled Chelsea Manning to masquerade as an administrator in a U.S. computer system during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, classified information here, so she could have downloaded that. Well, he at the time, Bradley Manning, could have downloaded that and then released it through WikiLeaks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But Donald Trump here, President Trump very clear, and we often see this, on how he's very much more ignorant about WikiLeaks than he was simply a matter of years ago. Here's what he said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable. It tells you the inner heart. You've got to read it. It's been amazing what's coming out on WikiLeaks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This WikiLeaks is like a treasure trove.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I know nothing about WikiLeaks. It's not my thing. I know nothing really about them. It's not my deal in life.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALSH: Now, it is the British court system, though, that will decide whether or not Julian Assange goes to the United States. That process could take months. Frankly, it may even be that whatever sentence he has to serve here in the U.K. for violating that bail is, in fact, expended while he's waiting to learn his extradition fate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And then it's possible in the United States he will face further charges. Now, there will be intense political debate here. His pretty substantial defense team already using the open court system to make a very clear case that he's a journalist who published information who's being persecuted. The indictment says he conspired to commit a criminal act. It will be up to U.K. judges to decide his fate -- Alisyn.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: OK, Nick Paton Walsh, thank you very much for all of that reporting.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Let's bring in CNN legal analyst Carrie Cordero. She is the former counsel to U.S. assistant attorney general.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Carrie, great to see you. So yesterday, as John and I were watching this arrest unfold on our air, I kept wondering why that day, why yesterday, after seven years, you know, of him being holed up in that embassy?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "[06:15:06] And I think that we've gotten the answer, which is there was this ticking statute of limitations. I was surprised to hear there is an eight-year statute of limitations for at least one of his charges. And so it sounds like -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- is that why they had to move with alacrity?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: I think it certainly was a factor. And I think it's important to keep in mind that this case against him and the investigations involving him and the process of extradition, this would have been work that was done behind the scenes by law enforcement and prosecutors and diplomats from the U.S., the U.K. and Ecuador, which was housing him for some time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And so I think it was a confluence, perhaps, where you had the statute of limitations. The legal process had been under seal. The indictment had been under seal in the Eastern District of Virginia for some time. And then we needed the other factor -- U.S. Law enforcement needed the other factor in play, which was the government of Ecuador finally making the decision to release him to U.K. authorities. CAMEROTA: Yes, and it sounds like their patience really ran out with him. I mean, certainly, we hear Nick Paton Walsh's reporting about the conditions that he was living in.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Let me read to you the indictment, because I think that it's interesting what we found out that he's being accused of. On or about March 8, 2010, Assange agreed to assist Chelsea Manning in cracking a password stored on United States Department of Defense computers connected to the Secret Internet Protocol Network, a United States government network, used for classified documents and communications.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So that is different, right? That's different than just publishing classified documents. That is taking an active role in getting them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CORDERO: Exactly right, Alisyn. So the passage that you just put up, that's really the crux of this particular indictment and charge against him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Julian Assange is not being charged with publishing classified information. I'll say it again. He's not being charged with publishing classified information. What he's being charged with is being an active participant in a conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In other words, he did a specific thing to try to assist Chelsea Manning to crack a password to get unauthorized access into Department of Defense procedures. And so what the Justice Department is going to argue is that is not traditional journalist behavior.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: Indeed. Carrie Cordero, thank you very much for all of the legal expertise -- John.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BERMAN: Just saying, I prefer posters as wall hangings. Just letting that out there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: That's good. That is more traditional.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BERMAN: Posters more traditional, to be sure.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What a swirl of controversy surrounding attorney Michael Avenatti this morning. He is fighting back against a new string of new charges.

And one of the things in this case that was stunning to a lot of", "augmented": []}
{"original": "people as they listened to it were the five people that the prosecutors say Michael defrauded. Five of them were clients of his, they say, who were defrauded of millions of dollars, including a paraplegic client, a client who had won a $4 million settlement that prosecutors say Michael Avenatti took, put into a trust account, as you are supposed to do for your clients, but then drained that trust account of more than $3.5 million, only giving the client somewhere around $125,000, telling him that the full settlement hadn't come in when he had already spent the money.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Here's a little bit more of what prosecutors had to say.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "NICK HANNA, U.S. ATTORNEY: As it turns out, within months after receiving the settlement proceeds in early 2015, Mr. Avenatti had drained the entire $4 million payment from his trust account, using significant portions of the funds to finance his coffee business, his auto racing enterprise and his own personal lifestyle.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SIDNER: Now, Michael has shot back, saying that he's not guilty of any of the charges against him, and he claims that any moneys owed due to his clients are bogus.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But we should mention that, with all of these charges -- and that's just in this case here in California -- that he faces up to 335 -- 335 years in prison. And that does not include the case that the SDNY has against him, which involves Nike, where they have said that he tried to extort Nike.", "augmented": []}

Truly from nowhere in the polls, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg appears to be breaking out in two early voting states. Look at these numbers from Iowa and New Hampshire. Pete Buttigieg has launched himself into third place behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, and ahead of some pretty big names.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "[06:25:05] I was supporting him for the Democratic National Committee chairmanship, because that's our core base. And he has gotten his message out there, partly on CNN town meetings and things like that. People like him a lot. I'm shocked at the number of people who come up to me and say, What do you think of this guy?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I demur, because I have to stay neutral, because I'm running the data project. And they say, Well, I sent him some money.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You did? These are people my age. So this is real. He's basically, I think, assured him, as barring some scandal or something, that he's going to be in the first cut.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: So Joe, strategically, what has Mayor Pete Buttigieg done better than other people? Why has he leapfrogged?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "JOE LOCKHART, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I agree that it's early. And I think that you've seen several of these candidates get a little bit of a bump around the time of their announcement. It's always the anticipation. Kamala Harris did, certainly. And then settled back down.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: And is that what you think is happening here?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "LOCKHART: I actually think it's a little bit more. I think -- I agree with Governor Dean that he touches constituencies he is, in some ways, touches all of the elements.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you look at Iowa and New Hampshire, the votes he's taking from are from Beto supporters but more than anyone, Bernie Sanders supporters, which was surprising when I looked at the numbers yesterday.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I think what that's about is people tend to look at, like, Sanders as Democrats want an ultra-progressive, a Democratic socialist. I don't think that's it at all. I think the Democratic constituency's much more in the middle.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I think it's -- I think it's people rebelling against incremental politics, the politics that I think Hillary talked about. We've got to go slow, we've got to make change.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And what Buttigieg is doing here is tapping into this idea that we can think big, Obama-like; we can change the system. We don't have to do it incrementally. And he's doing it in a language that young people understand, and they feel an affinity.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: I'm not interested in feuding with the vice president. But if he wanted to clear this out, he could come out today and say he's changed his mind, that it shouldn't be legal to discriminate against anybody in this country for who they are. That's all.", "augmented": []}

I think that even though Pete Buttigieg hasn't made this debate with Pence a central part of his campaign, it definitely helps him. I mean, any time that a Democratic candidate can be seen at odds with either the president or with the vice president, it boosts them. And that could be, also, part of why he's surging in the polls.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "One is to raise a lot of money, and the other is to be on the ground and set up a great network. He's not going to have any trouble setting up a network, and he's raised a lot of money. The problem is the expectations for -- for Beto were much higher than they were for Pete Buttigieg.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But Beto raised $83 million for a Senate race in Texas. Buttigieg, nobody ever heard of. But he's got momentum., and you guys are giving that momentum. I got that ride up, and of course, I got the ride down once I was the frontrunner.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "In one sense, Ames, Iowa, has something any other city might envy: An unemployment rate of 1.5%, the lowest in America.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Buoyed by Iowa State University's main campus, this metropolitan area with about 100,000 people just 40 miles north of Des Moines has long had a tighter-than-average labor market, meaning that almost everyone who wants a job can find one. But there's a downside to having that many jobs: Businesses looking to expand or relocate have a tough time finding employees.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If a company was doing a site search, and were basing it strictly on the unemployment rate, we would be out every time, said Dan Culhane, president of Ames' Chamber of Commerce. They're still able to find the workforce, Culhane explains, but it usually requires luring someone with the promise of higher pay or recruiting from out of town.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Ames' mixed blessing is an extreme version of what the U.S. may face should unemployment sink further past its current 16-year low of 4.1%: An undersupply of workers readily available for the work that needs doing. Economists at Goldman Sachs expect the rate to get as low as 3.3% by 2019, even if wages rise enough to draw people who had given up looking for jobs following the Great Recession back into the workforce.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That wouldn't be as much of a problem, of course, if unemployment were uniform across the country. There are still pockets with much higher unemployment rates, particularly in cities in California and New Jersey, where the housing bust hit hard.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "The very tightest job markets are overwhelmingly concentrated in a small part of the country. Out of the 20 metro areas with the lowest unemployment rates in November 2017, 14 are in Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, and Wisconsin.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Those regions have seen a run of good economic luck. Most of them didn't overheat during the housing bubble, and thus didn't fall too hard during the crash. As the recession wore on, agricultural areas were bolstered by high prices for corn and soybeans. These economies relied on some manufacturing, but few whole towns depended on it or suffered terribly as factories disappeared, like those in Michigan and Ohio. The upper Midwest has also largely managed to escape the opioid epidemic that has swept through the rest of rural America.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Meanwhile, North Dakota's oil-rich Bakken shale formation drew people from its neighboring states during the fracking boom, and many of them stayed even when oil prices declined and the frenzy faded — leaving fewer workers to go around overall.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "However, not all the jobs in the upper Midwest pay as well as working on an oil rig. Of the 1,700 jobs openings on the WorkInAmes.com job site, many are hourly positions in hospitality, transportation, or retail, paying between $10 and $20 an hour.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That can be a good thing. Such jobs don't require as much education, which helps keep unemployment low because the skills of the local labor force fit the work available — unlike in very high-skilled markets like Washington D.C., which have large populations that lack the education necessary to compete for the specialized jobs that exist there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But those middle-skilled jobs don't usually pay enough to convince someone to move from, say, Merced, California or Ocean City, New Jersey. In fact, plenty of cities with low unemployment also have high poverty rates, since the jobs that are available still don't pay enough to live comfortably.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Outside North Dakota, the Upper Midwest has seen relatively slow growth, in part because it also hasn't drawn the immigrant population that settled in border states and big coastal cities.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The Bakken was an interesting anomaly, because wages were so high, it literally just sucked people in, said Ron Wirtz, outreach director at the Minneapolis Federal Reserve. Everywhere else, you have normal labor market migration. And if you're not from the upper Midwest, it's probably a higher hurdle to move there, because of the weather.", "augmented": []}

People of color are no less willing to work there, said Alan Berube, deputy director at the Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Program. There are just fewer of them in the applicant pool to discriminate against. In more diverse places, white hiring managers are more likely to discriminate against people of color, which can keep a large chunk of the population on the sidelines.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In the homogenous upper Midwest, you're just not going to have a lot of labor market discrimination, because the people doing the hiring are going to look like the people applying, Berube said.

{"original": "And it seems like Joe Biden, who said during this interview, I am center left, is sort of staking out a clear position and adding some nuance to show that he's not as far left as the rest of the field, that he is basically trying to win over some of those Trump voters by saying, Listen, we're not going to let people die in the streets.

{"original": "[07:20:06] So is this a case of the Democratic Party moving so far left that it's moved him by? Or is it a case of the far left just having a louder voice than the rank and file?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "REBECCA BUCK, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: You know, I think it's the latter, that right now the progressive wing of the Democratic Party is incredibly vocal, incredibly powerful in Washington.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But when you look at the polling that we've seen throughout this election cycle, looking issue by issue where Democratic voters are and also, do they identify more as moderate, centrist Democrats or liberal Democrats, you actually see that the Democratic voters still are, by and large, quite moderate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And so this is Joe Biden's case that he's been making as to why he is the best candidate to be the Democratic nominee and take the party into the general election, because many Democratic voters out there across the country still are quite moderate. They aren't as far left as some of the conversation we've been hearing in Washington, for example. And he is sort of getting the big share of these moderate voters at this point.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But as we've seen in the polling, his lead is very tenuous, very fragile at this point. And so you have Kamala Harris and others trying to get that moderate piece of the Democratic vote. And that was exactly why she made the play she did in the debate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: He spoke directly to that. So Arlette, we heard the former vice president tell Chris about how, basically, he believes being moderate is the way to go and the winning strategy. So let's listen to that moment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BIDEN: Look who won the races. Look who won last time out. We had -- and by the way, I think -- I think Ocasio-Cortez is a brilliant, bright woman, but she won a primary.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In the general election fights, who won? Mainstream Democrats who were very progressive on social issues and very strong on education, health care.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Look, my north star is the middle class. When the middle class does well, everybody does well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: So Arlette, that sounds like that will be his kind of overarching message for his campaign.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. It really is, Alisyn. And you've now heard Biden basically prescribe these two brands to himself. One, that he's center left, and two, that he's an Obama-Biden Democrat.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And so going forward, and as you have seen throughout this campaign, Biden has really pushed back against that notion that there has been this leftward tilt in the party.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He had also talked about how Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a brilliant and bright woman. But he just doesn't think that the party has gone that far left, as you have heard him also say. He has made that argument, that there are very loud voices in the -- in the Democratic -- on the leftward side of the party.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But going forward, you know, Biden, he has said that he doesn't want to make any of these criticisms personal. But he's also starting to drill in on some of those issues.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You've seen him really keep his focus on President Trump throughout this campaign. But in that interview, he's staking out some very clear policy differences when it Medicare for all. Also decriminalizing border crossing. That's something that former HUD secretary Julian Castro has really led on, that Biden is now pushing back against.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So you're finally starting to see him really trying to make that differentiation between himself and those other Democratic candidates, as he has to get through them first in order to get to President Trump.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "AVLON: That was a fascinating point he kept making. I'm a fighter but without making it personal. A president needs to be a persuader.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Toluse, one of the most fascinating moments of that particular segment of the interview is when he talks about what he might be looking for in a V.P. Let's take a listen.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CUOMO: Do you think you need, if you win the nomination, to have a female V.P.?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BIDEN: I think it would be great to have a female V.P., and if I don't win, it would be great to have a female president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CUOMO: Do you think a Democrat ticket can win without a woman in one of the two slots?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "He had talked about that in the past, and he got a little bit of pushback for that and sort of seeming presumptuous, seeming as if he had already believed himself to be the nominee.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In this case, he sort of stopped himself from going that far and just saying that there are tons of qualified women who could be the vice president. And also even sort of giving a nod, saying that if he did not win the nomination, that he'd love to see a family presidential nominee.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "[07:25:02] So it did seem like he was sort of worried about being seen as being too presumptuous there and decided not to fully engage, and used it as an opportunity to speak to the women voters who are considering him but also considering the history of potentially having the first female president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The president -- or the vice president wanted to show that he supports those voters either choosing him or potentially choosing a woman to -- to be the nominee instead.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: Rebecca, I want to talk about style for a second. There's a lot of substance, obviously, in this interview. But stylistically, not every format is for every candidate. And Joe Biden seems to really come alive in that particular format with Chris Cuomo. He -- his eyes were bright. He looked energetic. He was able to kind of show off his institutional base of knowledge, from NATO to North Korea to Russia, because he has experience with all of those countries.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And he was able to kind of tout that in a way that somehow on stage with ten other people he seemed deferential. You know, he says in this interview he didn't want to engage in the scrum. But some people rose to the occasion of engaging in the scrum, you know. That debate stage was Kamala Harris' format, I would say.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And so what was your impression of how Joe Biden will come off to voters in this interview?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BUCK: Well, you know, he came off, I think, so much better than he did on the debate stage, than he has in some of the early cycles, news cycles of this Democratic primary. And so it begs the question why hasn't he been doing more one on one, sit-down interviews like this? Why hasn't he been going out there to present his story, to explain his positions, to defend his positions in a way that wasn't as confrontational as what you might see on the debate stage? You know, I think this format does him a lot of favors.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And he's been trying, in this race, to sort of, as you suggested, remain above the fray. To present himself as a front-runner return, as a statesman, as someone who's above all of the squabbling of the Democratic primary with two dozen candidates. But we're seeing that he hasn't been succeeding in that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And so I think this shows he needs to engage a little bit more. He needs to get out there.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Though you don't get an immediate federal tax break for contributing to a 529, once you fund an account, that money gets to grow tax-free. As long as you use that money for qualified higher education purposes, you'll get to keep your ending balance in full.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Traditional brokerage accounts, by contrast, require you to pay taxes on your gains year after year. This means that if you sell anything in your account at a profit, you'll lose a chunk of those proceeds to taxes, leaving you less money to reinvest. Along these lines, if you leave your investments alone during your college savings period and only sell them off once the time comes to start tacking those tuition bills, you'll lose a portion of your eventual earnings to taxes as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Then there are savings accounts, which not only impose taxes on interest income but offer very little in the way of returns to begin with. These days, you'll be lucky to get a solid 1% per year out of your savings account, making it a rather inefficient tool.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Imagine you earn $100,000 a year, and sock away 10% of that, or $10,000 annually, for 10 years. With a regular old savings account, you'll grow your college fund to roughly $104,000 -- not all too impressive considering that $100,000 of that stems from principal contributions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "On the other hand, if you save in a traditional brokerage account or 529, your investments might very well generate an average annual 7% return, which would leave you with $138,000 after 10 years' time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Here's the catch though -- if you have a traditional brokerage account whose investments you sell off to access that cash, you'll lose a portion of your earnings to capital gains taxes. Assuming you're in the 25% bracket, those taxes will knock a good $10,000 off your $38,000 in gains. With a 529, however, you'll get to use that $138,000 in full, as long as it's applied to qualified college costs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now one major drawback of opening a 529 is that if you don't end up using that money for qualified purposes, you'll face a 10% penalty on the gains portion of your account.

A panel of scientists warning thousands of Americans could die premature deaths, the economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars if global warming is not addressed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Scientists behind the study didn't just look at climate shifts over one day or even one year. They looked at long term trends here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: And joining us now is CNN's Allison Chinchar and Kim Cobb, climate scientist at Georgia Tech university. Good morning to both of you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Allison, you were on this call. And there was some interesting insight that came out the way questions were either asked or answered or not. ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes. So the main focus of the", "augmented": []}
{"original": "phone call was to talk about the report and the main takeaway from this was to show the direct impacts of climate change on Americans' lives. Usually these reports are from a global standpoint, but this was really a focus on the United States. They talked about the three industries that would be most impacted, real estate, health care, and agriculture being those.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But probably the most interesting thing about that phone call was at the end they did a question and answer segment, and they had numerous people ask about the timeline of this being issued Friday. But one person directly asked, they said this is the official White House climate report, and it says climate change is real. But you have the president of the United States saying it's not. What are we supposed to believe, the White House report or the White House spokesperson? And they refused to answer it. The moderator simply would not allow any of these panelists to answer that question. I just found that odd that these are the scientists, they wrote the report, and they're not even really allowed to answer that simple question.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PAUL: Did you get a sense they wanted to answer the question? Did anybody start to answer?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CHINCHAR: You could hear, things like that where people would start to, but the moderator, and I know that's their job is to decide who gets to answer the question. But I did get the sense that if they were allowed, maybe not all of them, but some of them would have liked to have answered that question.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: What about the question of timing. In other words, you release this at a time when --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CHINCHAR: The moderator shut that one down as well. Their response to that was simply we want the focus of this to be about the content of this, not about the timing of release.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PAUL: So with that said, Kim, just so the viewers know, Kim Cobb, of course, with us now, that you go to Christmas Island every two weeks. This is your area of study. Christmas Island in the Pacific, of course. Is what you heard from this report, does it correlate with what you found in 18 years of research?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "KIM COBB, CLIMATE SCIENTIST, GEORGIA TECH UNIVERSITY: Yes, absolutely. So as a climate scientist, some of us are in the business of digging back into the past to look at climate extremes before the rise of carbon dioxide. And of course what we see locked into records is coming up into the present, things are getting warmer, and the natural climate extremes that I study are getting more extreme, perfectly consistent with the findings of this report.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PAUL: And how -- I'm sorry. Go ahead, Martin.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: I was just going to ask, we've had a number of reports that have been done over the years. What makes this one so important, and why should we carefully look at it? COBB: Yes. I think these reports come out every several years, and", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this one I think caught my eye because it has ratcheted up some impacts that we had bigger uncertainties about in the past, and now with this report they are becoming clearer than ever. And that's unfortunately in the worst direction. So sea level estimates have ticked up. Our attribution of climate extremes has improved since the last report.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And so now we're really facing with a lot more certainty some of the very, very damaging types of climate exchange and impacts. And unfortunately, this report is just another exclamation mark on a year of dizzying records with wildfires, temperature extremes, heat waves, and of course the hurricane season in the southeast.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PAUL: So are we in the thick of this now based on what you ticked down, the list of what we're dealing with, or can you give us, Allison, some sort of a timeline when we're going to see this ratcheted up, or again, are we in it?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "[10:05:01] CHINCHAR: So you have some aspects that are already taking place. You have coastal flooding, places like Florida, the Carolinas, up and down the east coast. They call it sunny day flooding in Florida where it is not raining but they're getting those floods from the tides. It is a great example of that sea level rise.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Other things, it really is, it's going to take several more decades before you really start to notice large scale issues with. But the fact of this report was not just to chalk -- and I think that's what separates this report. This wasn't just the here is the doom and gloom. This specific report actually gave solutions to the problem. Here's how we can fix the ones that are happening now, and here's how we can fix the ones that we know will happen down the road.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CHINCHAR: So they talk about certain things in areas of the west. They have this drought program that's already existed and it is meant for farmers and ranchers on how they can to start to prepare for drought, for heatwaves, and how it would affect their livestock. The Acadiana Group in Louisiana that basically was created to help assess flooding risks for areas along the southeast. So again, you have these programs that are already being established to help look into the future of what can we do to mitigate some of these issues that we know will take place.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: Professor, is it too late? Can we still prevent it?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "COBB: Absolutely not. We have so much work to do. And so, as Allison was saying, some of that work is just reading into those regional reports, the report has region by region what are the expected impacts, and thinking about how scientists can work with people in their communities and policymakers to protect those communities today from the impacts that are coming down the pike today, actually. And so the other bucket of the recommendations that they make is of course to get on top of our emissions and start to make sure that we are not baking in more risk than we need to. It is absolutely not too late and we really have time to get to work.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But this report does stress that the time to do so is now. And it is really important for American health and well-being and economic prosperity that we take this very seriously.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PAUL: Allison Chinchar and Kim Cobb, we appreciate you both being here. Thank you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: Breaking news in Paris. Demonstrators are taking to the streets over rising fuel costs, gathering in the French capital to express frustration with President Emmanuel Macron after tax hikes on diesel and gas. Macron is also pushing incentives to purchase electric vehicles.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PAUL: Police are using tear gas, and, you can see there, water cannons to combat some of the, now we're told 8,000 protesters that have assembled there. Government officials are blaming far right extremists for inflaming the tensions there. CNN senior international correspondent Jim Bittermann is live in Paris for us. And Jim, I know you are standing right above this crowd along the Champs-Elysees. What are you seeing, hearing, feeling at this hour?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We're now six hours into the protest today. I'll just show you a little bit of what's going on right at our doorstep downstairs on the Champs- Elysees. These are yellow vested protesters, people who are protesting the rise in gas prices, but they've been joined by a lot of other people that are protesting all sorts of things, high taxes in France, the high cost of living. There are some pensioners in the crowd worried about their pensions and their retirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And they have been going up and down the avenue, the police have been using the water cannon, you maybe able to see it in the background there in action. And setting barricades out and then setting fire to barricades, which is what we have seen practically all afternoon long here. It does not seem to be at this point that the crowd is dispersing, but on the other hand the overall crowd is substantially smaller than the crowds that gathered in France a week ago. This started with a crowd of 230,000 people across the country. Today according to the interior minister it's about 23,000. So a substantially less number of protesters out, but these on the Champs- Elysees have been far more dramatic than we saw last week, in fact probably as dramatic as I've ever seen on the Champs-Elysees.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Authorities said they were going to try to keep people away from here because of all the high value stores and fashion boutiques and what not, and clearly that did not happen. Christi, Martin?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: Jim, the explosions and sounds that we're hearing in the background, what are they?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BITTERMANN: Well, they're basically -- some of them flash bombs that the police are using, and some tear gas. But also, the other thing is the demonstrators have brought with them fireworks, and we have seen a number of demonstrators set off fireworks, that's really what the explosions are. There's nothing that, as far as I can tell, that has caused much damage, although we did see one demonstrator injured a short while ago who was right next to one of these when they went off. And we have seen, as you can probably hear in the background, a regrouping of the protesters as the police try to move in to push them off the avenue.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "[10:10:08] PAUL: So Jim, we're listening to that as well and we're looking at these pictures, and I am wondering, President Macron has to be watching this as well. You mentioned earlier how low his approval rating is right now. Is there any indication how the government is going to address this?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BITTERMANN: There is some, Christi. In fact, President Macron said that he is going to address the situation on Tuesday. We're not sure what he is going to do. I would suspect there might be a decrease in the gas tax announced or something like that, but he doesn't have a whole lot of room to maneuver here, given the economy in France and that sort of thing. And he's also been very resolute about saying that he is going to carry out government reforms. Some of the protesters today, for example, are against the reforms he announced from the first days in his office, the reforms to the labor laws in this country. He said that's what we have to do to get the economy moving here. That was met very positively by a lot of businessmen in the country, but now two years after those reforms were announced, in fact this is what we are having on the streets as people feel the bite of the reforms and the high taxes and whatnot. Christi?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PAUL: Jim Bittermann, I'll say it again, take good care of yourself and your team there. Thank you, sir. We appreciate it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "All right, so while much of the focus is on climate change right now in Washington, there is a deadline looming there. In a little more than a month, Democrats will take control of the House of Representatives.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: Let's bring in CNN senior White House correspondent Jeff Zeleny. Jeff, President Trump's financial ties to Saudi Arabia is near the top of the Democrats' agenda, but it is not the only thing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good morning. It is not the only thing, Martin. This really is the last month that the president will be enjoying a full Republican control of the House and Senate. And he's already getting early sign of what some Democrats who will be coming into House of Representatives to assume control of their investigations and oversight, of what they're looking at.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And one of the things, Adam Schiff, he's the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he said yesterday that he in fact wants to look at any links between the Trump administration, the Trump Organization, and Saudi Arabia, financial links. Of course one thing else on the list for Democrats is the finances of the Trump Organization, his tax returns, something he has never wanted to give up. So something is going to change in Washington. We'll see how successful Democrats are in getting these from the president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But without question, it is going to be a new era, a new moment for the president when the new year begins. But before that, the president on the golf course here in south Florida, he is thinking about some changes of his cabinet. He says he may have some before too long here. But as of now, sunny day in Florida. I think it's pretty much a vacation weekend for the president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PAUL: Jeff Zeleny, I hope you enjoy a little bit of the sunshine yourself. Thank you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: And breaking news this hour. The gunman in an Alabama mall shooting Thanksgiving night still on the loose.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PAUL: Here's the thing. Authorities now say the 21-year-old man killed by an officer at the mall, quote, likely did not fire the rounds that injured two people. CNN reporter Natasha Chen with us now. So essentially they're saying there was misidentification here of who the culprit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "NATASHA CHEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. So overnight the Hoover police department released this statement on Facebook, and the statement said our department does not typically issue media updates during an internal investigation, but there was information discussed with local media last night that merits update and clarification. The initial report was that two men gotten into a fight of some kind at the mall that resulted in a 21-year-old shooting an unarmed 18-year- old, and that victim was taken to the hospital.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The update now says the 21-year-old identified as Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford may have been involved in some aspect of the altercation, but he likely did not fire the rounds that injured the 18-year-old victim. Police say Bradford did flee the scene and brandished his weapon. That's when an armed Hoover police officer who was working mall security shot and killed him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So if he is not the one who shot the 18-year-old, there's someone out there who did. Police say they now believe there were more than two people involved in the initial fight. They say at least one gunman is still at large who could be responsible for the 18-year-old victim as well as a 12-year-old girl who caught in the crossfire. She was also taken to the hospital.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I reached out to the agency that has taken over this investigation to find out exactly how many suspects they're looking for, and whether they believe Bradford fired any rounds at all. Last we heard the officer involved in the shooting is on administrative leave while they investigate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "[10:15:01] PAUL: Natasha Chen, thank you for the update.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: And still to come, an American was killed during a mission trip to a remote island near India. We talked to a leader of the organization he was affiliated with and got her reaction to the news.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PAUL: So we have some new details this morning about a letter an American missionary wrote just before he was killed on an island near India. John Chau gave the letter to fisherman before he left their boat for the island.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: And it shows that he knew the tribes, people living in isolation there, were dangerous. Chau wrote, You guys might think I am crazy in all this, but I think it is worth it to declare Jesus to these people. Please do not be angry at them or at God if I get killed. CNN's Polo Sandoval has more details.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is one of the oldest and most isolated tribes in the world. Authorities say they're responsible for last week's killing of American missionary John Allen Chau.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "[10:20:06] This archived footage from Survival International provides some of the few existing images of the tribe known as the Sentinelese. They live in complete isolation on the tiny island of North Sentinel. According to Indian officials, Chau illegally paid fisherman to take him to the isolated island hoping to convert the tribe to Christianity. Authorities believe he first canoed to shore on November 16th, deliberately disregarding an established perimeter around the island.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "According to journal entries left with the fisherman and shared with the Washington Post, the 26-years-old wrote, I hollered my name is John. I love you. And Jesus loves you. He was then reportedly shot at by a member of the tribe with an arrow, piercing his bible. The next day, Chau made a second attempt, but never returned.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The fisherman he hired later reported seeing the young man's body buried on the beach by tribe members. Chau's last entry in his journal reads You guys might think I'm crazy in all this, but I think it is worthwhile to declare Jesus to these people. God, I don't want to die. In 2006, the same tribe killed two poachers who had been illegally fishing near their island. Survival Interview, a group advocating for tribal people, believe the natives decision to be remain isolated should be respected.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SOPHIE GRIG, SURVIVAL INTERNATIONAL SENIOR RESEARCHER: They've made it very clear they don't want contact. Somebody comes, they have no idea what he is coming for and why. I think it is far more self- defense than it is murder.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SANDOVAL: On social media, Chau's family wrote their son loved God, life, helping those in need, and had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people, and forgive those reportedly responsible for his death, the wrote. All they can do is wait to do is find out when or if their son's body will be recovered.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: Earlier we spoke to Mary Ho, the international executive leader of the missionary organization John Chau worked for, and we got her perspective on the trip.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "MARY HO, INTERNATIONAL EXECUTIVE LEADER, ALL NATIONS: He has been preparing his whole life for this. We knew he was very well prepared. There were several people who would have been happy to go with him, but this is typical of John. I think he did not want to endanger other people's lives. And so finally he went alone. And that was his decision. But there were others who were willing to go with him.", "augmented": []}

Police have now fired tear gas, water cannons have been brought to bear as well to try to disperse the crowd. This has grown in the level of violence that we have been witnessing, not only the response from authorities but there are fires that are now being set on the streets of Paris. There are the sounds of explosions, a combination of flash bangs that are being used by authorities as well as fireworks that are being used by the protesters.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "All of this was sparked as a result of the government implementation of new taxes on fuel, gasoline and diesel, and this is the result of people in opposition.

{"original": "PAUL: President Trump hasn't responded to the assessment yet of this newest report, but some members of Congress have. Senator Angus King tweeted in part, We're staring a threat in the face. Now is not the time for denials, excuses, or equivocation. Now is the time for action. Democratic strategist Kevin Cate with us, as well as CNN political commentator Scott Jennings. Gentlemen, thank you so much for being here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Scott, I want to ask you, how do people reconcile this report by all of these scientists who are in the Trump administration with the president who continually denies the existence of it?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "[10:30:04] SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I think the president is grappling with a serious issue here, and that is how to deal with what is clearly a real thing. I mean, I don't think climate change is a hoax. The climate is changing. And then on the other end of it you are trying to figure out what actions can we take that would help counteract it, but at the same time not immediately devastate people in economic regions that are more sensitive to it than others, say in Appalachia where the coal industry is still important.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So that's what a U.S. president has to grapple with. That's what policymakers have to grapple with. I do think that some acknowledgment that climate change is real would be a good thing, and then we can have a real debate about how to deal with it without making too many short-term changes that would displace people out of an economy they depend on.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PAUL: Kevin, how hopeful are you that the potency of the report might bring some sort of legislation?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "KEVIN CATE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I'm not optimistic. I appreciate what Scott said because he is acknowledging climate change as a real and urgent threat. And I think what this report does is put it in terms of the pocketbook. It talks about the jobs that we'll lose. It talks about the health care that is going to be lost and the complications that are going to happen. I live in Florida. I know Scott is in Appalachia. It is affecting the coal industry there. It's affecting Florida right now. This is an urgent issue. If you go down to Miami Beach during king tide, this is an urgent issue that is costing jobs, it's costing tourism. I think if the president, if we can get him to care, maybe it's about the electoral math in 2020 and how important Florida is, because if we don't have a candidate who understands how urgent this is in Florida and throughout the country, they're not going to win Florida because this is that important.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PAUL: Scott, talk about that. If there aren't some Republicans getting on board with this, what is the political ramification of that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "JENNINGS: Well, I think if we continue to see weather events that are portrayed as being caused by or made more extreme by climate change, that will be more on the minds of voters in 2020. Of course, any of these issues and their impact on an election really depends on if the candidates themselves make it a top priority. My suspicion is this will be a top priority in the Democratic primary for president. The real issue, of course, would be if either candidate makes it a top priority in the general election.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I do think it is important we look at what the United States has done over the last several years. I think sometimes these stories are portrayed as though nothing has been done. I did note that a report from Agriculture Department said that since 2004, North America's share of fossil fuel emissions has fallen 24 percent down to 17 percent, going up to 2013. So I think there has been some progress made.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PAUL: But without the president's support, can progress continue to be made?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "JENNINGS: Without the president's support, no legislation would be signed into law, if that's what you're looking for. But that doesn't mean the free market can't continue to innovate. Another core issue here is, will consumers demand more environmentally friendly technologies, will they demand more electric cars, for instance. So I think there's two ends to this. There's the government response, but then there is also will the market respond to consumers if they make it a priority in their own spending.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PAUL: Real quickly, switching gears here, Adam Schiff has said that he wants to investigate the president and Saudi Arabia and any business ties that are in existence there. Kevin, is this the way for Democrats to finally get what they have been looking for, the president's tax records?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CATE: Well, I think it is important to get to the truth of any of this. It is certainly concerning that he is coming out, defending the Saudis in relation to what potentially may have happened there and what our intelligence community, the way that we understand it, is leaning towards. So I think it is important to get to the truth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But I don't think Democrats are going to lose focus on the pocketbook issue that got them the majority, which is super important. We know that people don't like President Trump, we know we elected the National Enquirer, some that's womanizing, uses racist language, and denies truths like climate change or the crisis in health care. We know all that. We have to give people a reason to vote for something. So going down the path of why you shouldn't like President Trump, it is probably not a great strategy in the short term or the long term when it comes --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PAUL: Scott, I have 10 seconds. I want to give you a chance to react to that.", "augmented": []}

The AR-15 bullet is much more devastating.", "augmented": []}

You said When doctors make recommendations about salt intake, no one accuses us of being anti- sodium, no one tells us to stay in our lane.

And as I said, I sometimes believe that what America season their TVs is really a sanitized version. The pictures that we see are the Facebook pictures of the victims. And instead I think there was a teachable moment, not being disrespectful at all, but we had a teachable moment to show what those guns and what the gun did to all those kids.

With that loyalty test failed, Trump is also lashing out at Republicans who are refusing to get on board with a dead-end attempt to throw out the election results and erase his loss to President-elect Joe Biden when Congress counts the electoral votes next week.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Over the last 24 hours, Trump has called for a primary challenge to the second-ranking Senate Republican, South Dakota's John Thune, praised GOP Missouri Sen.

Ted Cruz of Texas, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Steve Daines of Montana, John Kennedy of Louisiana, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, and Mike Braun of Indiana, and Sens.-elect Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Roger Marshall of Kansas, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama.", "augmented": []}

The results of those efforts, though, have been uneven. The decision to dash his veto of this year's National Defense Authorization Act, which Trump opposed because it didn't strike legal protections for social media companies and included a provision to rename military bases named after Confederate leaders, marked the first time during Trump's presidency that Republicans openly and materially rejected his desires.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "That's a common occurrence in the American judicial system. Less common is a defendant arguing at a sentencing hearing that head injuries caused mental disabilities that led him to defraud the government. But it's no coincidence that Mitchell's new life is dedicated to those fields.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Mitchell wants to write a book detailing his many ups and downs, but he's deeply interested in prison reform and wants to pursue endeavors that would allow him to advocate in that area. Meanwhile, his primary goal is to establish a mental-health clinic and foundation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "My perception of the NFL is that it was an education, he said, and I learned from it. I learned not everyone is looking out for you, and you have to basically look out for yourself. I forgot that lesson, and going to prison really reinforced it. But it's made me realize how important it is to be there for others.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Mitchell's mental health issues provide his motivation to help others with theirs, but those same issues are also holding him up.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's not good, he said point-blank when asked about his quality of life. I'm raising a child, and I get extreme migraines, so I deal with my disability every day.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "She's very young, and she would love to live her life, he said of his wife, but we can't because of my disability. So it's sad, but we just try to maintain a stable, quality life while we can.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Knowing all of this in hindsight, does he regret playing football?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I don't regret anything, he said, because I understand that I had to make that sacrifice to get out of where I was at [financially]. To try to better my family and the next generation of Mitchells, I was willing to take that sacrifice.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But he realizes there might have been alternatives.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I went to UCLA, he added after reconsidering the question about regrets. I easily could have become a businessman or entrepreneur somewhere else. But not even five years after I was done with football, my brain started slowing down. A lot of things are altered when you just bang your head in since the age of five.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Looking back, Mitchell doesn't like to use the word bitter, but he still spends time stewing about the Eagles and life as an NFL player in general. He says he still won't cheer for Reid in his current role with the Kansas City Chiefs, pointing to the way things ended in the spring of '05.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It just sucks because we're expendable as athletes, he said. Coaches have to learn by going through players, but the players still have a life. It's very depressing, and it just hurts. Because I had a relationship with his son, who passed away, better than anybody around. And it just hurts that after I chose T.O. over McNabb as far as who was right in a situation, he had to go with McNabb. You live and die by your quarterback, and I was expendable—I didn't have a $100 million contract to deal with.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It isn't hard to pick up on the narrative Mitchell has established regarding his NFL demise. The infamous rift between Owens and McNabb was brewing just as the Eagles released Mitchell, and he and Owens were allies. It's possible Reid and the front office considered those politics when they cut Mitchell, but there's little doubt that Owens also rendered Mitchell more expendable on the field in 2004.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "I'm a forgiving person, but if somebody can cost you about $40 million for a second contract, I don't know how forgiving you can be, Mitchell said. I feel like I sacrificed so much to get that big second contract, and he screwed me. It just sucks. And that's how the game goes. And that's my livelihood. This only lasts so long. So the only thing I ended up with is the concussions and the migraines and the disabilities I have now. That's all I have to show for it. That's it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But Mitchell's broader frustration—and particularly his resentment for Reid—appears to regard the system itself, which is evident when he touches on that expendable nature of being a non-star player. Mitchell views the NFL as basically legalized prostitution.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Any time it's a third-down situation or fourth-down situation, then they needed me, he said. Now they want me. So it's just humorous to me because I had to self-promote myself because I was just not getting any love, only because Donovan McNabb wanted all the attention.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I felt used pretty much the whole time, he concluded, because my talents weren't utilized the way I thought they should have been.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Through representatives, both McNabb and Reid declined to comment for this story.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In Mitchell's mind, the Eagles—who also opted not to comment—had an opportunity to redeem their relationship with the star of one of their most memorable plays after Mitchell was released from prison in 2017. It's at that point that a former prisoner returned to his former home and went to his former employer in search of support.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He says he showed up at the team facility on his first day back in Philly, figuring he could lay the foundation for a new chapter in his life. He had a story to tell, having gone from a humble upbringing to 4th-and-26 to the Super Bowl to being in the hole, as he calls it, and having dealt with the debilitating symptoms of concussions along the way.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Why do you hate me like this? he remembers thinking. What did I do to you?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Mitchell says he told the team he'd make appearances for free to let people know I'm in the community, but he says he still hasn't received a call from the organization.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "All they care about is who can make them money and who can win them ballgames, he added. Which it's a business; I get that. But it still hurts to see somebody that you sacrificed for—you go and try to get help from them, and there's just no movement. It's nothing to them to find me a position so I can get back on my feet. It's nothing. But, no. None of that happened.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "While behind bars, Mitchell says he assumed he'd be embraced by a team that in 2009 signed Michael Vick three weeks after the quarterback was released from home confinement following a prison stint. He was wrong, and he was further perturbed when, in September, Lurie hosted popular local hip-hop artist Meek Mill—who was out on bail from a sentence related to a parole violation—at the team's home opener.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Altogether, Mitchell says it caused him to fall back into a deep depression.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's funny that Jeffrey Lurie was out there with Meek Mill, paying him hundreds of thousands of dollars [to appear or perform at team events], and he's in the owner's box and he's balling and stuff after he got out of prison, he said. Jeffrey Lurie and the organization loved him. And yet a player that sacrificed his well-being, his life, his everything for them—they never gave me any opportunities. I couldn't even get invited to make a $500 appearance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "According to a source with knowledge of Mill's dealings with the team, the Eagles compensated Mill for at least one performance at a team-related event, but there's no indication of how much they paid the rapper. Regardless, Mitchell doesn't hold ill will toward Mill for any compensation he may have received from the organization.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In fact, Mitchell is a big supporter of Mill's. His music motivated me while I was in prison, he said. And his poetry gets me through life every single day, but to see the Eagles sticking up for his injustices but not mine, it hurt.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He's under the impression this is a common occurrence, and that professional sports teams frequently leave former players in the dust when they feel they don't have anything positive to offer the organization.

{"original": "Former Eagles offensive tackle Jon Runyan, who serves as vice president of the Philadelphia chapter of the National Football League Alumni Association, notes that alumni involvement is a two-way street that requires frequent communication from both team and former player. And the reality is that middle-aged retired players like Mitchell are less likely to consistently engage, at least compared to older retirees like the 61-year-old Cobb.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you actually look at the guys that come to the events, they're the older guys, said Runyan, who was teammates with Mitchell throughout the wide receiver's pro career. They're the guys that are old enough to be my dad.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Everybody feels like they're an outcast, Runyan said of his experiences with generally younger retired players, and yet they don't want to invest the time to be a part of the process.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Additionally, most former players, regardless of age, left the team on better terms than Mitchell did—Reid said in April 2005 that Mitchell was absent from a minicamp practice because the head coach did not want him here. Others also maintained strong relationships with the franchise and community, while Mitchell makes no secret of his resentment toward a franchise he feels betrayed by.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Could that lack of relationship explain why Mitchell believes the team hasn't properly celebrated 4th-and-26?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's not as though the Eagles pretend the play didn't happen. The team's official Twitter account did post video of 4th-and-26 on last year's anniversary of that game, and it is included as part of a video montage of great moments in Eagles history that airs on the Lincoln Financial Field video boards at home games—but on their social media, Mitchell notes, you wouldn't even know that Freddie Mitchell existed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The franchise's Twitter account has sent over 47,900 tweets since 2010, but only one of those posts has mentioned Mitchell by name. For what it's worth, only three tweets from the Eagles have mentioned Owens. But a lot of players from that era who put up numbers similar to Mitchell's—James Thrash, Todd Pinkston and L.J. Smith, to name a few—have also hardly been mentioned.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Mitchell's lack of social media love wouldn't be out of the ordinary if not for the fact that none of those other guys were involved in such a historic play. A 2017 NBC Sports Philadelphia poll indicated 4th-and-26 was the second-best play in team history, behind only 2010's Miracle at the Meadowlands. And it is routinely ranked highly on lists of memorable NFL moments.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "The Philly Special is more in vogue than 4th-and-26, and Mitchell said he wondered for a while whether last year's hoopla would cause his play to get buried. But that didn't stop him from joining the fans to cheer on the team he often detests during its Super Bowl pursuit.

{"original": "To be effective, the DNI must never shy away from speaking truth to power -- even, especially, when doing so may be inconvenient or difficult, Haines said at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. To safeguard the integrity of our intelligence community, the DNI must insist that, when it comes to intelligence, there is simply no place for politics ever.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "I will be focused from day one on providing support to America's workers and to small business, putting into effect as quickly and efficiently as I can the relief in the bill that was already passed and then, over time, working for a second package that I think we need to get through these dark times before the vaccination program enables us to go back to life as we knew it, Yellen told the Senate Finance Committee during her confirmation hearing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Yellen also reaffirmed that Biden eventually wants to repeal parts of the 2017 tax cuts that benefited the highest income Americans and large companies, as well as reverse the law's incentives to offshore operations.

{"original": "But the new deal hasn't yet been ratified by Congress, where Democrats have expressed opposition. And even if the new United States Mexico Canada Agreement ends up raising tax revenue, there's nothing earmarking that money for a wall.

{"original": "This is overstated. Available Customs and Border Protection data shows a total of 396,579 people were apprehended by the US Border Patrol for fiscal year 2018 at the southwest border, which would mean an average of 1,087 each day – hardly the thousands that Trump purports. The numbers differ each month. The highest number of apprehensions was in September, with a daily average of nearly 1,400.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Apprehensions are still well below historic highs. In the early 2000s, for example, annual apprehensions routinely topped 1 million. After hitting an historic low in 2017 of around 300,000, apprehensions increased in fiscal year 2018 to nearly 400,000.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The President also expressed concern about what he called a growing humanitarian crisis. There's been an uptick in unaccompanied minors and families approaching the US-Mexico border, many of whom are seeking asylum. Deteriorating conditions in the Northern Triangle (Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras) are among the reasons that some have decided to make the journey.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Similarly, a 2018 study by the libertarian Cato Institute, which reviewed criminal conviction data from the Texas Department of Public Safety, found that immigrants – legal or illegal – are less likely than native-born Americans to be convicted of crimes.

{"original": "Democrats have long strenuously opposed Trump's campaign promise that he would build a concrete wall on the US-Mexico border. But they did not propose a steel barrier as an alternative. Rather, Democrats have continued to oppose the construction of any new steel or concrete barrier on the southern border. They have only kept the door open to funding a border barrier as part of a broader immigration deal.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Trump: Sen. Chuck Schumer has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This is correct but context is key. Schumer previously supported legislation to build physical barriers on the US-Mexico border. Most notably, Schumer and other Democrats supported the 2006 Secure Fence Act that authorized the construction of several hundred miles of fencing along the border, but not a wall. However as long as the government remains shut down, Senate Minority Leader Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have refused to offer any funding for a border barrier.", "augmented": []}

Police officers are being cut from the streets of America because the president decided to cut the COPS program.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So we can do a better job of homeland security. I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I will hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them. We'll do whatever is necessary to be safe.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But I pledge this to you, America: I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCHIEFFER: Mr. President, you have 90 seconds.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I want to thank Arizona State as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Yes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I have got a comprehensive strategy to not only chase down the al Qaeda, wherever it exists -- and we're making progress; three-quarters of al Qaeda leaders have been brought to justice -- but to make sure that countries that harbor terrorists are held to account.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As a result of securing ourselves and ridding the Taliban out of Afghanistan, the Afghan people had elections this weekend. And the first voter was a 19-year-old woman. Think about that. Freedom is on the march.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We held to account a terrorist regime in Saddam Hussein.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In other words, in order to make sure we're secure, there must be a comprehensive plan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "My opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance, comparing it to prostitution, illegal gambling.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous. I don't think you can secure America for the long run if you don't have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "At home, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland. I signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources. My opponent voted against it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But absolutely we can be secure in the long run. It just takes good, strong leadership.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCHIEFFER: Anything to add, Senator Kerry?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "KERRY: Yes. When the president had an opportunity to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, he took his focus off of them, outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, and Osama bin Laden escaped.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Six months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, Where is Osama bin Laden?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He said, I don't know. I don't really think about him very much. I'm not that concerned.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We need a president who stays deadly focused on the real war on terror.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BUSH: Gosh, I just don't think I ever said I'm not worried about Osama bin Laden. It's kind of one of those exaggerations.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Of course we're worried about Osama bin Laden. We're on the hunt after Osama bin Laden. We're using every asset at our disposal to get Osama bin Laden.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "My opponent said this war is a matter of intelligence and law enforcement. No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Question 2: How did the U.S. end up with a flu vaccine shortage?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCHIEFFER: New question, Mr. President, to you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We are talking about protecting ourselves from the unexpected, but the flu season is suddenly upon us. Flu kills thousands of people every year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Suddenly we find ourselves with a severe shortage of flu vaccine. How did that happen?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BUSH: Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the United States citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated. And so we took the right action and didn't allow contaminated medicine into our country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We're working with Canada to hopefully -- that they'll produce a -- help us realize the vaccine necessary to make sure our citizens have got flu vaccinations during this upcoming season.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "My call to our fellow Americans is if you're healthy, if you're younger, don't get a flu shot this year. Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The CDC, responsible for health in the United States, is setting those priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I haven't gotten a flu shot, and I don't intend to because I want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We have a problem with litigation in the United States of America. Vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued, and therefore they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "One of the reasons I'm such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people aren't afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England is for those of us who are younger and healthy, don't get a flu shot.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "KERRY: This really underscores the problem with the American health-care system. It's not working for the American family. And it's gotten worse under President Bush over the course of the last years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Five million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country. You've got about a million right here in Arizona, just shy, 950,000, who have no health insurance at all. 82,000 Arizonians lost their health insurance under President Bush's watch. 223,000 kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "All across our country -- go to Ohio, 1.4 million Ohioans have no health insurance, 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000, Wisconsites lost it under President Bush.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This president has turned his back on the wellness of America. And there is no system. In fact, it's starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits -- though they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing them -- but because of the larger issue that we don't cover Americans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Children across our country don't have health care. We're the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I have a plan to cover all Americans. We're going to make it affordable and accessible. We're going to let everybody buy into the same health-care plan senators and congressmen give themselves.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCHIEFFER: Mr. President, would you like to add something?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints, and a plan is not to lay out programs that you can't pay for.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He just said he wants everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that senators and congressmen get. That costs the government $7,700 per family. If every family in America signed up, like the senator suggested, [it] would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's an empty promise. It's called bait and switch.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "KERRY: Actually, it's not an empty promise.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's really interesting, because the president used that very plan as a reason for seniors to accept his prescription drug plan. He said, if it's good enough for the congressmen and senators to have choice, seniors ought to have choice.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What we do is we have choice. I choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Other senators, other congressmen choose other programs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But the fact is, we're going to help Americans be able to buy into it. Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves. We're not giving this away for nothing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Question 3: With rising costs, how do you keep from raising taxes?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Sen. Kerry, a new question. Let's talk about economic security. You pledged during the last debate that you would not raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. But the price of everything is going up, and we all know it. Health care costs, as you all talking about, is skyrocketing, the cost of the war.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "My question is, how can you or any president, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that we're running up to our children?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "KERRY: I'll tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "During the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules. If you were going to pass something in the Congress, you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "President Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1.6 million jobs lost. He's the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, I'm going to reverse that. I'm going to change that. We're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Every plan that I have laid out -- my health-care plan, my plan for education, my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans -- I've shown exactly how I'm going to pay for those.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And we start -- we don't do it exclusively -- but we start by rolling back George Bush's unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the McCain-Kerry Commission which identified some $60 billion that we can get.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We shut the loophole which has American workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I'm going to stand up and fight for the American worker. And I am going to do it in a way that's fiscally sound. I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I have a manufacturing jobs credit. We pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas. We raise the student loans. I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This president has never once vetoed one bill; the first president in a hundred years not to do that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BUSH: Well, his rhetoric doesn't match his record.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "[He's] been a senator for 20 years. He voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4.2 trillion.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He talks about PAY-GO. I'll tell you what PAY-GO means, when you're a senator from Massachusetts, when you're a colleague of Ted Kennedy, pay go means: You pay, and he goes ahead and spends.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There is a tax gap. And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap? The middle class.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I propose a detailed budget, Bob. I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, here's how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years. It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Question 4: What do you say to someone who lost his job?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCHIEFFER: Let's go to a new question, Mr. President. Two minutes. And let's continue on jobs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You know, there are all kind of statistics out there, but I want to bring it down to an individual.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Mr. President, what do you say to someone in this country who has lost his job to someone overseas who's being paid a fraction of what that job paid here in the United States?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BUSH: I'd say, Bob, I've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century. And here's some help for you to go get an education. Here's some help for you to go to a community college.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We've expanded trade adjustment assistance. We want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You know, there's a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing. We talk about fiscal matters. But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I went to Washington to solve problems. And I saw a problem in the public education system in America.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "They were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And so we said: Let's raise the standards. We're spending more money, but let's raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before it's too late.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "No, education is how to help the person who's lost a job. Education is how to make sure we've got a workforce that's productive and competitive.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Got four more years, I've got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand Pell Grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And so the person you talked to, I say, here's some help, here's some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And that's what I would say to that person.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "KERRY: I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Let me come back in one moment to that, but I want to speak for a second, if I can, to what the president said about fiscal responsibility.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This president has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see. Health-care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But guess what, America? The wages of Americans have gone down. The jobs that are being created in Arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we're losing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And the president just walks on by this problem. The fact is that he's cut job-training money. $1 billion was cut. They only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "They've cut the Pell Grants and the Perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "They've cut the training money. They've wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I'm going to do those things, because that's what's right in America: Help workers to transition in every respect.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Question 5: Is Bush entirely to blame for loss of jobs?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCHIEFFER: New question to you, Sen. Kerry, two minutes. And it's still on jobs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You know, many experts say that a president really doesn't have much control over jobs. For example, if someone invents a machine that does the work of five people, that's progress. That's not the president's fault.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So I ask you, is it fair to blame the administration entirely for this loss of jobs?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "KERRY: I don't blame them entirely for it. I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I've acknowledged that in union halls across the country. I've had shop stewards stand up and say, Will you promise me you're going to stop all this outsourcing?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I've looked them in the eye and I've said, No, I can't do that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Today, if you're an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas. You get to defer your taxes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So if you're looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent. And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field. This president didn't stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies. He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after I'd been talking about it for months.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on China for currency manipulation. There are companies that wanted to petition the administration. They were told: Don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we haven't stood up and fought for.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I'm going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker. And I will fight for the American worker just as hard as I fight for my own job. That's what the American worker wants. And if we do that, we can have an impact.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Plus, we need fiscal discipline. Restore fiscal discipline, we'll do a lot better.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Let me start with the Pell Grants. In his last litany of misstatements he said we cut Pell Grants. We've increased Pell Grants by a million students. That's a fact.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You know, he talks to the workers. Let me talk to the workers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You've got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you have a child, you got a $1,000 child credit. That's money in your pocket.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you're married, we reduced the marriage penalty. The code ought to encourage marriage, not discourage marriage.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans. A family of four making $40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's your money. The way my opponent talks, he said, We're going to spend the government's money. No, we're spending your money. And when you have more money in your pocket, you're able to better afford things you want.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "My opponent talks about fiscal sanity. His record in the United States Senate does not match his rhetoric.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "KERRY: Bob, anybody can play with these votes. Everybody knows that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times. I broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and Ronald Reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for. I voted for IRA tax cuts. I voted for small-business tax cuts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But you know why the Pell Grants have gone up in their numbers? Because more people qualify for them because they don't have money.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But they're not getting the $5,100 the president promised them. They're getting less money.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We have more people who qualify. That's not what we want.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BUSH: Senator, no one's playing with your votes. You voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He voted to violate the budget cap 277 times. You know, there's a main stream in American politics and you sit right on the far left bank. As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Question 6: Do you believe homosexuality is a choice?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCHIEFFER: Mr. President, let's get back to economic issues. But let's shift to some other questions here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Both of you are opposed to gay marriage. But to understand how you have come to that conclusion, I want to ask you a more basic question.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Do you believe homosexuality is a choice?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BUSH: You know, Bob, I don't know. I just don't know. I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity. It's important that we do that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I also know in a free society people, consenting adults can live the way they want to live.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But as we respect someone's rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn't change -- or have to change -- our basic views on the sanctity of marriage.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I believe in the sanctity of marriage. I think it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I proposed a constitutional amendment. The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process. After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States. You know, Congress passed a law called DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "My opponent was against it. It basically protected states from the action of one state to another. It also defined marriage as between a man and woman.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But I'm concerned that that will get overturned. And if it gets overturned, then we'll end up with marriage being defined by courts, and I don't think that's in our nation's interests.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "KERRY: We're all God's children, Bob. And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I think if you talk to anybody, it's not choice. I've met people who struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I've met wives who are supportive of their husbands or vice versa when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I think we have to respect that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The president and I share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. I believe that. I believe marriage is between a man and a woman.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can't discriminate in the workplace. You can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You can't disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital. You have to allow people to transfer property, which is why I'm for partnership rights and so forth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, with respect to DOMA and the marriage laws, the states have always been able to manage those laws. And they're proving today, every state, that they can manage them adequately.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Question 7: How does Kerry handle criticism from Catholic archbishops?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCHIEFFER: Sen. Kerry, a new question for you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The New York Times reports that some Catholic archbishops are telling their church members that it would be a sin to vote for a candidate like you because you support a woman's right to choose an abortion and unlimited stem-cell research.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What is your reaction to that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "KERRY: I respect their views. I completely respect their views. I am a Catholic. And I grew up learning how to respect those views. But I disagree with them, as do many.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I believe that I can't legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith. What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn't share that article of faith.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I believe that choice is a woman's choice. It's between a woman, God and her doctor. And that's why I support that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, I will not allow somebody to come in and change Roe v. Wade.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The president has never said whether or not he would do that. But we know from the people he's tried to appoint to the court he wants to.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I will not. I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic. I was an altar boy. I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, I'm not running to be a Catholic president. I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "My faith affects everything that I do, in truth. There's a great passage of the Bible that says, What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds? Faith without works is dead.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's why I fight against poverty. That's why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's why I fight for equality and justice. All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But I know this, that President Kennedy in his inaugural address told all of us that here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own. And that's what we have to -- I think that's the test of public service.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BUSH: I think it's important to promote a culture of life. I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life. I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Take, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion. It's a brutal practice. People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice. It made a lot of sense.

{"original": "Using funds from the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the Massachusetts Highway Division has awarded nearly $54 million in contracts for highway improvements. One company, Aggregate Industries Northeast Inc., based in Saugus, Massachusetts, was awarded two stimulus contracts totaling $8.9 million for roadwork in the state.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Aggregate Industries is one of the largest producers of aggregate, asphalt and ready-mixed concrete in New England. But Aggregate Industries has a record of misconduct, and six of its former managers pleaded guilty or were convicted of defrauding the government.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The company supplied thousands of truckloads of substandard concrete to Boston's Big Dig project. The Big Dig, which cost $22 billion and was the most expensive highway project in the U.S., rerouted Interstate 93 underneath the center of Boston. The project was plagued with problems, mainly due to shoddy construction and inferior materials.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In 2007, the state of Massachusetts announced a fraud settlement against Aggregate Industries, alleging that for years the company had supplied defective concrete to the Big Dig project. According to the settlement, the quality of the concrete was so poor that it wouldn't set properly, which led to cracking, leaking and other defects.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The company agreed to pay $50 million in fines, and this past summer six of the company's former managers pleaded guilty or were convicted of defrauding the government.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But two years later, Aggregate is using taxpayer dollars to perform roadwork in Harvard, Littleton, Avon and Stoughton, Massachusetts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Luisa Paiewonsky is the Highway Division administrator for the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, which is responsible for allocating stimulus funds for transportation projects.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Asked why the department continues to work with companies that have defrauded the state in the past, Paiewonsky replied, We do have a history of referring contractors to the attorney general's office, and we have suspended contractors in the past.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But Aggregate isn't alone. The New England Center for Investigative Reporting found that 13 of the 21 companies that got federal transportation money have a history of misconduct. Aggregate is just one of the most glaring examples.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Paiewonsky said she can only follow the law with Aggregate Industries -- the law laid out in its settlement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Under that agreement finalized by the U.S. attorney, the Massachusetts attorney general and the U.S. Department of Transportation, Aggregate Industries paid a $50 million fine and was put on probation overseen by a federal monitor, who was to ensure the company abided by federal and state rules. The settlement also stipulated that Aggregate Industries would not be cut off from government contracts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Nancy Sterling, a spokeswoman for Aggregate Industries, said the company learned its lesson.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The company took it extremely seriously. It's a very different company prior to the 'Big Dig.' There are new managers, new owners and a whole new corporate ethics and compliance policy in place.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Sterling said Aggregate Industries had lived up to the terms of the settlement and is not doing anything wrong.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Similarly in the United Kingdom, research finds that geography determines opportunity – social and economic mobility is simply more constrained if you're born in certain parts of the country.

{"original": "Dumb 401(k) move No. 1: Not participating or under-participating", "augmented": []}
{"original": "One of the worst things you can do with a 401(k) account is not use it -- or underuse it. There are more than 600,000 defined contribution plans such as 401(k)s in existence, with more than 70 million people participating in them. As of late 2016, there was about $7 trillion in 401(k) plans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That sure seems like a lot of money, but most accounts are far from able to support anyone in retirement. For example, the average 401(k) account balance in Fidelity Investments-managed plans hit a record average of $92,500 as of the end of 2016. Indeed, income from 401(k) accounts has been estimated to represent about 25% to 30% of overall retirement income.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Thus, it's best to be socking away as much as you can for retirement, whether in IRAs, 401(k) accounts, or elsewhere.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "One big plus for 401(k) plans is that they have much more generous contribution limits than IRAs (which only accept up to $6,500 in 2017).

{"original": "Maybe you can't immediately sock away $18,000 or $24,000 in your 401(k) each year, but whatever level you start at, aim to increase it regularly. Contributing 10% of your earnings? Try to make it 11% next year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you're not contributing the maximum to your account, be sure to at least contribute enough to grab all available matching funds from your employer. As an example, a common match is a dollar-for-dollar one up to 3% of your earnings. If you earn $75,000 and contribute 3%, or $2,250, to your account, you would get another $2,250 from your employer -- and that's free, guaranteed money.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "The next dumb thing you can do with your 401(k) is to invest in suboptimal ways in it. For example, a 401(k) plan will typically feature default investment choices, and they tend to be conservative ones that won't serve you well if you're young -- and they may not be great if you're older, either. Make sure that you decide how your 401(k) money will be invested. Don't just leave your account plowing your contributions into conservative default investments.", "augmented": []}

Similarly, don't get caught up in greed, either, chasing after riskier funds that have had a good year. Be patient and you can accumulate a lot of wealth over time.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "I have questions about the maximum safe withdrawal rate, or the 4% rule. If you're withdrawing the money from an IRA, do you factor in your marginal tax rate to arrive at the 4% withdrawal? And how do you adjust withdrawals in reaction to strong or weak investment results?--J.N.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The 4% rule is probably the best-known strategy for turning money in IRAs, 401(k)s and other retirement accounts into income you can count on for life. Despite all that's been written about it over the years, however, many people still aren't completely clear about how this rule works.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So I'm going to try to answer your question and explain the ins and outs of this withdrawal strategy by boiling it down to three essential points:", "augmented": []}
{"original": "1. The basics of the rule are pretty simple, but they're still sometimes misunderstood.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Many people mistakenly believe that to follow the 4% rule you simply withdraw 4% of your nest egg's value each year throughout retirement. Not so. You withdraw 4% of the total value of your nest egg the first year of retirement. Then you increase the dollar value of all subsequent annual withdrawals by the inflation rate to maintain your purchasing power.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, for example, if you have total retirement savings of $1 million and inflation is running at 2% a year, you would withdraw $40,000, or 4% of your $1 million, the first year of retirement, $40,800 the second year, $41,600 the third, $42,450 the fourth, and so forth. Following the 4% rule doesn't guarantee that you won't run out of money. But sticking to this schedule of withdrawals should provide a reasonable level of assurance that your nest egg will last at least 30 years, which, as this longevity calculator shows, is about how long you should plan for your money to support you in retirement given today's long lifespans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I'm often asked whether dividends and capital-gains distributions that are paid in cash, as opposed to re-invested, should be included in calculating the withdrawal. The answer is yes. For example, if you plan to withdraw $40,000 in a given year and you will receive $15,000 in dividends or capital gains distributions in cash, then you would draw only $25,000 from your nest egg, so that the combination of dividends, distributions and the withdrawal gets you to your $40,000 target.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As for your question of whether your tax rate should play a role in calculating the withdrawal rate, the answer is no. Here's why: Let's say you withdraw 4% of your nest egg's value, or $40,000. Whatever you may end up paying in taxes on that amount (or not paying if you're withdrawing from a Roth account), doesn't change the fact that the value of your nest egg has dropped by $40,000. And it's the change in your nest egg's value over time, not how much you end up with in spending cash after paying taxes on a withdrawal, that determines how long your savings will last.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Of course, you could compensate for taxes by increasing the amount you withdraw. For example, if you're pulling money from a traditional IRA and you're being taxed at the new federal 24% tax rate, you could withdraw roughly $52,600 so you'd end up with $40,000 after taxes. But then you would have increased your withdrawal rate to almost 5.3%, and a higher withdrawal rate would increase your chances of depleting your nest egg prematurely.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So you should think of the 4% rule only as a way to estimate how much you can withdraw from your nest egg if you want your savings to last throughout retirement. The rule isn't meant to ensure you'll have enough income to live on. Depending on the size of your nest egg and other resources, a 4% withdrawal rate could be just right for your needs, fall short of them or generate more income than you actually require.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "2. The 4% figure isn't carved in stone.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What we now call the 4% rule comes out of research by financial planner William Bengen in the early 1990s. Essentially, Bengen tested a variety of withdrawal rates on several different allocations of stocks and bonds using inflation data and investment returns going back to 1926. After crunching the numbers, he concluded: Assuming a minimum requirement of 30 years of portfolio longevity, a first-year withdrawal of 4%, followed by inflation-adjusted withdrawals in subsequent years, should be safe.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But given low bond yields and modest projected returns for stocks in recent years, a number of retirement experts have cautioned that the 4% rule might not provide the same margin of safety against running out of money as it has in the past.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For example, David Blanchett of Morningstar and Wade Pfau and Michael Finke of The American College of Financial Services have suggested that retirees who don't want to outlive their savings may need to scale back their initial withdrawal rate to 3% or so. Similarly, Newfound Research managing director Justin Sibears has warned in more recent research that to the extent the huge run-up in stock values of recent years leads to modest investment returns in the years ahead, retirees may need to go with an initial withdrawal rate of less than 4%.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's not to say that everyone has written off the 4% rule. In his Nerd's Eye View blog, financial planner Michael Kitces has pointed out that since the late 1800s there have been a number of times when bond yields have been low and stocks have performed abysmally. Still, Kitces notes that a portfolio invested 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds following the 4% rule has never ran out of money over a 30-year period. Indeed, more often than not someone with that asset mix and adhering to the rule would have ended up with more than double the amount they started with after 30 years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Still, absent a way to predict the future path of inflation and the investment markets, it's impossible to know with absolute certainty that you won't outlive your savings by employing the 4% rule. Given that inherent uncertainty, I'd say choosing a withdrawal rate comes down to how concerned you are about running through your nest egg too quickly.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you find the possibility of watching your savings balance dwindle in your dotage a terrifying prospect, then you might want to start with a withdrawal rate closer to 3% than 4%. On the other hand, if you have lots of maneuvering room -- say, substantial home equity or other resources to fall back on or the ability to scale back your spending without too severely crimping your retirement lifestyle -- then you might start with a withdrawal rate of 4%, or even higher.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Which brings us to the third important point you need to know about the 4% rule...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "3. Whether you start with 4% or some other rate, you've got to be ready to adjust your withdrawals.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It would be nice for budgeting purposes if you could set an inflation-adjusted withdrawal schedule that would guarantee your money will last exactly as long as you do. But that's not realistic. For one thing, we don't know how long we'll live. And even if we did, we still don't know how the investment markets will perform. So you want to arrive at a balance between spending down your nest egg too quickly (and running out of savings while you've still got a lot of living to do) and spending it too slowly (and ending up with a huge retirement stash late in life and regretting you hadn't spent more freely earlier in retirement).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The way to do that is to adjust your withdrawals up or down as you go through retirement. If the market goes on a tear for a few years and your nest egg's value starts to swell despite withdrawals, then you might want to increase the size of your withdrawals for a few years or treat yourself by taking out some extra dough for an overseas trip or whatever.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Conversely, if the market takes a big hit or churns out a series of subpar returns and your nest egg's value drops precipitously, you might want to skip a couple of inflation increases or even scale back the amount you withdraw.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I don't know of any way to get this balancing act exactly right. Again, there are just too many unknowns -- how long you'll live, how the financial markets will perform, what your retirement expenses will be (with health care costs being a particularly unpredictable wild card). But one possibility is to follow a prescribed system for making adjustments. For example, Vanguard has developed what it refers to as a dynamic approach to spending that involves setting an initial level of withdrawals and then allowing each year's withdrawal to fluctuate within a given range, say, never increasing more than 5% or falling more than 2.5%.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Or you can take a less formal approach. Every year or so you can go to a retirement income calculator that estimates the chances that your nest egg will last throughout retirement and plug in your current savings balance and planned withdrawals. If the calculator shows that your chances of depleting your nest egg have risen significantly in recent years, then you may want to scale back your planned withdrawal. If your chances of running through your savings have dropped precipitously, then you might consider boosting the amount you pull from savings.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As you go through this process, keep in mind that once you reach age 70 1/2, you must make required minimum distributions from 401(k)s, IRAs and similar retirement accounts, even if it means pulling more from your nest egg than you wish. Fail to do so, and the IRS could slap you with a penalty equal to 50% of however much your withdrawal falls short of the required minimum.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I think most retirees are probably capable of managing this sort of process -- i.e., starting with a reasonable level of withdrawals and making sensible adjustments as conditions change. But if you find the prospect of doing this daunting -- or you just don't like the idea of doing it on your own -- you can always turn to an adviser for help.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But whether it's the 4% rule, a variation of it or some other way of tapping your nest egg, you've got to come up with a withdrawal system that won't deplete your savings stash so quickly you'll be forced to scrimp in your old age or so slowly you end up regretting you lived more frugally in retirement than you had to.", "augmented": []}

The tax subsidy does encourage the purchase of bigger and more expensive homes; tax dollars are subsidizing McMansions. The American people are getting nothing good for their $200 billion subsidy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In order to benefit from the mortgage interest deduction, homeowners must itemize deductions and not take the standard deduction.

{"original": "New Year's Day has come and gone, but there's still time to play catchup on last year's savings goal. If you weren't able to contribute to your IRA in 2016 (or simply forgot), but have the financial means to do so now -- you're in luck.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "(CNN) Congress has just passed a historic $2 trillion stimulus package that was signed into law by President Donald Trump on Friday afternoon. Beyond giving most Americans direct assistance in the form of a one-time check, it extends unemployment benefits to workers who don't traditionally have access because they don't have an employer via a new program called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This extension is incredibly important because, according to the Freelancers Union, full-time freelancers made up 28% of the American workforce in 2019 ; in 2014, they made up just 17%. Nonetheless, there are already signs that the implementation of unemployment benefits for self-employed people will be riddled with problems and inconsistencies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Last week, the president of the Freelancers Union, Rafael Espinal, sent a letter to New York City and state lawmakers, urging them to consider the specific plight of freelancers. He wrote, Unlike traditional employees, freelancers are excluded from receiving paid leave and unemployment insurance, and shoulder the cost of their own health and disability insurance. Without a concerted effort to extend relief to these workers, the economic impact of COVID-19 on independent workers will be nothing less than devastating.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Fortunately, this new stimulus package is vastly more inclusive and equitable in terms of addressing the scope of the Covid-19-related economic crisis than the Families First Coronavirus Response Act passed earlier this month. The latter provided no direct aid to self-employed freelancers and gig workers, who make up almost a third of the American workforce. The only thing it promised was eventual help in the form of tax credits equal to what freelancers would have been paid during the affected period.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "While tax credits help some freelancers -- especially those highly paid ones who tend to take a hit when it's time to pay taxes -- they are essentially too little, too late for many of us. According to the Freelancing in America report , the median hourly rate among freelancers overall is $20/hour (gross annual salary of $41,600), while for skilled freelancers, it's $28/hour ($58,240/year). In other words, most freelancers don't have much in the way of a rainy day fund. In addition, many freelancers file their taxes annually rather than quarterly, which means that they wouldn't see the aid from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act until spring 2021.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Thus, many freelancers are breathing a sigh of relief that they too will be included in the new stimulus package. As Espinal told me by phone, This is going to hopefully ensure that there's cash flow into the homes of freelancers, who, he stressed, are doubly affected by this crisis because we depend on many of the non-essential small businesses that have been shut down in order to do our work.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Espinal also noted that Pandemic Unemployment Assistance wouldn't have been achieved if not for the committed negotiating of Democratic senators, which resulted in a delay in an agreement by a few days, but ultimately a better deal. Espinal was in close contact with Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer's office to make sure freelancers were included in the language of the package.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In a tone-deaf move devoid of empathy for what Americans are going through, some GOP senators objected to the extra unemployment benefits that would be offered to eligible workers, $600 per week, feeling that it was too generous (as Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii tweeted) and might disincentivize people to go back to work once the crisis is over. This of course ignores the fact that the extra unemployment benefits only last for four months and wouldn't be indefinite. And, just before the House passed the stimulus bill Friday, a Republican representative, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, attempted to thwart its passage by requesting a full roll-call vote and forcing many members of the House to travel to Washington (despite the fact that this is ill-advised and risky during a pandemic) to block him.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Still, despite freelancers' inclusion in the stimulus package, for freelancers like me in California, this extension of benefits is coming at a time when many of our careers have already been upended by AB5. This California law mandates the reclassification of certain workers formerly classified as independent contractors so that they're considered waged employees. But there are many self-employed people who aren't gig workers who work for one or two rideshare companies. Many of us are freelancers who provide services -- without key employment protections -- for dozens of entities per year, and we don't meet the standard to be reclassified as employees, nor do many freelancers want to be reclassified.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "According to the National Employment Law Project, the new legislation's unemployment assistance will extend to self-employed people and independent contractors , and even if a state has an inappropriate definition of employee, gig workers can use this new program -- showing proof of income and an explanation of how the pandemic prevents them from working -- to get the same benefit they would if they qualified for state unemployment insurance. Whether workers can get state unemployment insurance or federally funded pandemic unemployment assistance, according to NELP, they all go through the same state unemployment insurance portal and benefits are calculated the same.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's unclear to some, however, if freelancers do end up qualifying for state benefits, how the amount would be calculated. This CNBC article lays out some details and highlights the complexity of freelancers' situation: The [Labor Department] guidance should also stipulate if and how gig workers can get benefits for a severe decline in income, rather than outright job loss. Gig workers and contractors are likely to be able to get partial benefits if they don't earn too much. Also, as the article notes, many people who apply for unemployment aren't granted the benefits: approval rates range from a shockingly low 10.5% in North Carolina to over 50% in New Jersey.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "For those of us with varying incomes from month to month, and who don't have anchor clients (repeat clients) who have explicitly told us they can no longer contract with us because of Covid-19, it's very difficult to prove that we're losing income because of the pandemic. For example, how does a freelancer writer know if a story they pitched isn't picked up because the outlet doesn't want it, or because they no longer have the budget for it? Also, given that state unemployment agencies are completely overwhelmed by the millions of claims that have been filed recently, the fact that freelancers' situations and sources of income are more complex could cause a delay for many of us in accessing benefits.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "As Espinal stated in a Freelancers Union email press release Friday afternoon, This bill is an incredible victory for the millions of freelancers who are unable to work due to this crisis.

However, even with this important win, direct economic assistance still feels very theoretical for the millions of freelancers scrambling to figure out how to apply for unemployment benefits or even, like me, how to prove that we qualify.

{"original": "Early indicators suggest the program is succeeding in attracting disillusioned fighters away from East Africa's al Qaeda affiliate.

{"original": "Most programs point to low recidivism rates as a benchmark of success. If only a tiny few go back into the arms of the group, then a program may say it is successful.

{"original": "PHOTO: John Horgan Housing for Somalia's internally displaced persons on the outskirts of Kismayo.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Additionally, in Somalia, defection from Al-Shabaab is a one-way street. The defectors tell a common story: They will slaughter anyone who goes back. In other words, defectors fully expect to be killed by Al-Shabaab if and when they do dare to leave the group.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The challenge for programs such as Iftiin's is to be able to evaluate success without pointing to a low recidivism rate that may have little if anything to do with the program itself.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Iftiin Foundation and others like it in Somalia are small groups. Unsurprisingly, the scale of the problem often borders on overwhelming. Defectors are flowing out of Al-Shabaab, yet there are not enough places for them to go.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The 2014 UN Population Estimation Survey of Somalia found that more than 80% of the country was under 35.

So even if ex-combatants want to reintegrate, there are few legal job opportunities for them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Despite ongoing terrorist attacks by Al-Shabaab, defectors tell me the group is in disarray. In the past 18 months, they say several hundred men and boys have left, and there are signs of many more just waiting to leave. Disillusionment is rife, defectors allege, with many of the rank and file deeply dissatisfied with the harsh reality and associated traumas of combat. Yet most still remain in the movement, in part, because they don't see a way out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I learn from the defectors sitting across the table how leaving works. A member can run away from the organization and turn himself in to government authorities. Or those reluctant to take such a risk can instead reach out to family members, who in turn contact authorities for help in facilitating an exit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When defectors hand themselves in, they are interviewed by police or other government officials for up to a week. They are then classified as low, medium or high risk. It's unclear how this assessment is made, or even what risk means.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If defectors are considered low risk, they are released to one of several regional transition centers, a type of community center that provides food and housing, to begin the Socioeconomic Reintegration of Ex-Combatants and Youth at Risk Project, the rehabilitation program.

{"original": "A woman walks along a street in the Somalian port city of Kismayo.", "augmented": []}

This training culminates in soon-to-be graduates receiving a micro-enterprise grant, about $1,500 in-kind, according to Iftiin, to start their own business and get back on their feet.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Traditional models of deradicalization involve prison-based activities, such as individual counseling with psychologists, group therapy sessions and regular meetings with religious scholars attempting to undo the ideological damage of life in such groups. Somalia's program expands on this model by focusing on what happens after the former fighters graduate from the initiative.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Each defector is matched with a local sponsor who can vouch for his whereabouts and well-being at any moment. Often this is a friend or family member. The sponsor accepts responsibility for checking on the defector, monitoring his welfare, and, if potential security concerns arise, communicating with local security forces. That concern is often less about fear of recidivism and instead possible victimization by community members less willing to accept that the former fighter is no longer a threat.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A common criticism of terrorist reintegration programs is that they are soft on those who deserve little more than, at best, life behind bars. Such reactions are understandable. Yet to ignore programs such as Iftiin's is to deny opportunities to address the terrorism problem in creative and groundbreaking ways.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "To appreciate just how much progress this program makes, we only need look at its impact on the community. According to Iftiin, 90% of the first cohort of graduates still had their small businesses running after six months. Considering that many have lived all their lives in extreme poverty or have never had any formal education, this is remarkable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It also owes something to the long-standing tradition of entrepreneurialism, as well as family support, in Somalia. One young boy, who became involved with Al-Shabaab when he was 14, had his store robbed. He had been supporting his entire family, but when loved ones subsequently rallied behind him, it helped the boy quickly reopen his business.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "On the surface, annuities may seem like an incredibly enticing investment to consider as part of your retirement plan. Insurance companies dangle promises of market-like returns on the upside with no risk of loss during your accumulation years and guaranteed income during your distribution years to get you to sign up for them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When you dig beneath that surface, you often find that the promises offered by annuities in their marketing wind up severely limited by things like caps, participation rates, and internal fund costs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Over time, those limits mean that you'll very likely wind up better off investing directly in the market via index funds than investing via an annuity. As a result, while you're accumulating money for retirement, annuities generally don't belong in your retirement plan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Still, despite the fact that annuities usually make lousy investing vehicles, they can provide reasonable insurance benefits in the form of guaranteed income during retirement. Simple, straightforward single premium immediate annuities from strong insurance companies can provide people with the peace of mind of knowing they won't run out of money in retirement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Simple annuities like that can work out for retirees who aren't comfortable managing their own money. After all, the risks of a poor withdrawal strategy from an investment portfolio could leave a retiree without income at a time when that retiree has no realistic way of earning a living through work.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Still, even the best of annuities have drawbacks that you should recognize before you commit to using them at all.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "First, any annuity is only as good as the financial strength of its issuer. If the insurance company offering your annuity were to declare bankruptcy, you would be dependent on the limits and funding sufficiency of your state's insurance backstop program to provide you any income.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In addition, any option offered by the annuity company beyond the basics of a simple income stream for either a guaranteed time period or for your life will likely come at a substantial cost. Want inflation protection? That will cost you. Want to assure your heirs will get something after you pass? You're likely better off leaving that something outside your annuity than asking the insurance company to handle it for you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Don't forget the biggest annuity you probably already have", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In addition, if you work in the United States, chances are that you already have access to a retirement plan that acts very much like an annuity that offers you an inflation-protected income for life. It's called Social Security, and even in the worst case scenario where nothing gets done to shore up the program, it's expected to cover around three-quarters of its promised benefits for retirees.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The typical retiree or retired couple receives enough from Social Security to keep out of abject poverty. While Social Security alone won't let you live a lifestyle of the rich and famous, it's fair to ask how much guaranteed income you really need above Social Security. Other than health-related costs, most retirees find that their expenses actually go down when they're retired. If you don't need additional guaranteed income, you might be better off with the greater flexibility that you get outside of annuities.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Remember, too, that even Social Security's promises are expensive to provide. The combined employee and employer tax rate is 12.4% of your income up to $128,400 of income, and it takes 35 years of those taxes on your earnings to qualify for your full expected benefit. Guarantees, are not cheap, no matter whether they come from the government or from an insurance company. The typical recipient of those guarantees will ultimately be the one paying for that guarantee.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Know their role -- and limit the bells and whistles", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you consider them only for the portion of your finances that really needs the guaranteed income they promise, annuities may make some sense as part of your retirement plan.

{"original": "Though they were created to help people save for retirement, Roth IRAs work in a similar way. But you don't get a tax deduction for your contributions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The big difference between the two accounts is that the money in a 529 must be used for qualified higher education expenses, or else be slapped with a 10% penalty. The contributions you make to a Roth IRA can be withdrawn at any time for any reason.

{"original": "In most cases, you can choose a 529 plan from any state you'd like and use the money for tuition, room and board at the college you choose.

With term life insurance, you'll typically pay a fixed premium in exchange for a fixed amount of coverage for a specific term or period, usually 10 to 30 years. If you pass away during the term of your policy, your family is paid the amount of your fixed death benefit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Because term life insurance coverage has a start date and an end date, this type of protection is typically the least expensive to buy. However, once your term ends, you won't have any coverage. Also, there are different variants of term life insurance coverage you can choose from, including return-of-premium policies that let you get your premiums back when your policy ends, or term coverage you can convert to permanent life insurance later on.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Best for: People who need a considerable amount of income protection during their working years and those buying life insurance on a budget.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Whole life insurance is a type of coverage that is permanent, meaning your policy lasts for your lifetime. While whole life is more expensive than term life insurance, the lifetime benefit that whole life offers can provide consumers with more peace of mind.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Like term life insurance, premiums on whole life insurance generally stay the same throughout the policy, and your beneficiaries receive a guaranteed fixed benefit amount at your death (provided you make on-time payments on your policy for its duration). But whole life insurance also comes with a cash value component, which many companies tout as a savings account of sorts that you can borrow against while you're alive.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Best for: People who are willing to pay more in premiums for a death benefit that lasts for life, as well as potential cash value from their insurance policy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Universal life insurance is another type of permanent coverage that combines a death benefit with a cash value component. Customers with universal life can rely on the cash value of their policy for a loan, but they can also withdraw funds over time. The cash value also earns interest that's based on market rates, which means the amount of interest you can earn will fluctuate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This type of coverage also comes with some flexibility when it comes to your premiums. For example, you may be able to use the cash value of your policy to adjust how much you pay in premiums each month, or to cover your premiums altogether.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Some companies allow policyholders to adjust the death benefit on universal life insurance policies over time if you remain in good health.

{"original": "Variable life insurance is another type of permanent coverage that comes with a death benefit and a savings component. The main difference is that the premiums on variable life policies are typically invested by your insurance company in stocks, bonds and money market funds, with the goal of receiving a higher return.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Because of the investment component of variable life insurance, this type of coverage is generally seen as more risky. However, taking on more risk offers the opportunity for potentially higher returns. If the underlying investments within your variable life policy perform well, you may see the cash value of your policy and your death benefit increase substantially.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Group life insurance can come in many different forms, and it may include any type of life insurance coverage. The main difference is group life insurance is marketed and sold to an entire group at once — usually a cohort of employees at a company. Typically speaking, this means the group can get coverage without individual medical exams.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Depending on where you work, you may get group life insurance coverage extended to you for free as an employee benefit. However, the benefit amount is typically on the smaller side, so if you need a higher level of protection, you'll want to supplement any group life insurance coverage with other coverage.

{"original": "It trades at about 24 times earnings forecasts for its next fiscal year -- more than twice the valuations for both H&R Block and Liberty Tax.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But Intuit may be worth the premium as more and more Americans look to do their own taxes instead of shelling out money to get someone to do it for them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said that Intuit started promoting its services (including free tax filings) more heavily earlier on this year -- and that hurt H&R Block.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Luria conceded that bargain hunters might find H&R Block more attractive than Intuit. It pays a dividend that yields more than 3.3% too, compared to Intuit's yield of just 1.2%.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But Intuit has all the momentum right now. So anybody looking to use their tax refund to buy stocks might be better off investing in Intuit over H&R Block and Liberty.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Buying a home is a major financial undertaking, so much so that a growing number of Americans are struggling to meet that milestone. For one thing, the homeownership rate among Millennials has dropped in recent years, due in part to a limited inventory of starter homes, and also to student debt payments monopolizing so much of younger workers' income.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Gen Xers are having a hard time buying homes as well. Between credit card debt and child care expenses, many workers in their 30s and 40s don't have the funds on hand to take that leap.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The problem, of course, is that those who put off homeownership lose out on key tax breaks for as long as they continue to rent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you're looking to become a homeowner, but you're finding it difficult to meet that goal, here are a few tips to make the prospect of buying more affordable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You might think you don't have much leeway when it comes to saving money each month, but if you're willing to take a long, hard look at your budget, you'll probably come to find that there are some expenses you can manage to cut, whether it's the cable plan you can afford to downgrade or those daily lunches you know you can prepare yourself. Reworking your budget is apt to get you closer to your goal of buying a home, so comb through your expenses line by line and figure out which are less important to you. Then, pledge to reduce or eliminate those spending categories and bank the difference.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Many people think of side hustles as a way to drum up a little extra spending money. But if you're willing to put in the time, that second gig could help you save some serious cash. Among the estimated 44 million U.S. adults who currently have a side hustle, 36% earn over $500 a month from that extra work. And that could help you reach your homeownership goal way faster than by just cutting corners here and there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's often the case that you'll get more for your money in the suburbs than in a city. If you're struggling to come up with a down payment that'll buy you more than a shoebox in your local metro area, consider expanding your search perimeter to its surrounding towns. Many suburbs offer convenient public transportation options that allow you to commute to work while enjoying the benefits of cheaper housing and bigger living spaces than what you'd find in a city.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Though having a strong credit score won't help you come up with a down payment, it will help you qualify for the best possible mortgage rate available, thus making the prospect of homeownership more affordable on the whole. Therefore, if your score isn't stellar, it pays to take steps to raise it as quickly as possible.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You can accomplish this in a number of ways. First, make a point to pay all of your bills on time. Secondly, aim to pay down a chunk of whatever outstanding balances you're carrying. This will alter your credit utilization ratio, which is a major component of determining your score. Finally, review your credit report thoroughly for errors. One in five credit reports contains a mistake; correcting yours could send your score into more favorable territory.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Though this should only be used as a last resort, if you're really having a hard time saving for a home but are tired of throwing out money on rent, you have the option to remove up to $10,000 from an existing IRA in order to purchase your first home. Normally, withdrawing funds prior to age 59 and 1/2 would subject you to a 10% penalty, but the IRS allows this exception for first-time homebuyers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But again, this option is far from ideal, because any time you remove money from an IRA, that's less income you'll have available in retirement. Furthermore, it's not just that principal amount you're losing out on during your golden years, but the growth it could've achieved over time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Still, if you're desperate, you might choose to take an early withdrawal and make that homeownership dream come true. As a compromise, you might decide that whatever tax savings you glean from owning will go directly into your retirement plan to compensate for the sum you withdrew.", "augmented": []}
