Fear of a global economic slowdown has dragged stocks from their all-time highs set in late September. Investors worry about the Federal Reserve's plans for 2019. If it raises rates too quickly, the Fed could artificially slow the economy or even bring about a recession. Inflation is not currently a problem, so the central bank has the ability to slow its rate-raising pace if it wants.

What we now call the 4% rule comes out of research by financial planner William Bengen in the early 1990s. Essentially, Bengen tested a variety of withdrawal rates on several different allocations of stocks and bonds using inflation data and investment returns going back to 1926. After crunching the numbers, he concluded: Assuming a minimum requirement of 30 years of portfolio longevity, a first-year withdrawal of 4%, followed by inflation-adjusted withdrawals in subsequent years, should be safe.

When the Republicans controlled the Senate during the George W. Bush and Trump presidencies, they used reconciliation to pass trillions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthiest people and most profitable corporations. They also used reconciliation to try and repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017. Today, Democrats must use this same process to lift Americans out of poverty, increase wages and create good-paying jobs.

You can get a decent estimate of what sort of savings effort will be required by going to a good retirement income calculator and plugging in the age at which you hope to retire, the amount you already have saved and how income you think you'll need when you retire. By running several scenarios with different savings rates, you should be able to come away with a sense of how much you'll need to ratchet up your savings rate to have a reasonable shot at success.

Mueller is such a frightening bogeyman for Donald Trump that in his evenings alone he may think he sees him in the shadows at the White House. Whether Mueller's report will be made public is an open question – but if it's not, Congress could use its power to put at least some of what the special counsel is discovering into the public domain.

Perhaps the largest ticking time bomb from a tax perspective comes from the money that Americans have in IRAs, 401(k) plans, and other qualified retirement plans. 401(k)s have about $5.3 trillion in assets, according to the Investment Company Institute, and total retirement assets amount to $27.2 trillion. That second number includes annuities and traditional pensions, and both figures consist of both traditional and Roth-style IRAs and 401(k) plans.

Even in accounts that don't have these tax advantages, there are things you can do to cushion the blow of the tax collector.

GO WITH AFP STORY by Desiree Martin A picture taken on April 12, 2013 shows plants of marijuana at the plantation of the Sibaratas Med Can association in Mogan on the southwest coast of the island of Gran Canaria. The plants grow from cuttings for approximately two months and then blossom before being harvested, dried, stored in jars for a month and later processed to be consumed on site. Spanish law prohibits the possession of soft drugs like cannabis in public and its growth to be sold for profit is illegal. But the law does tolerate growing cannabis for personal use and its consumption in private. Dozens of private marijuana smoking clubs operate across Spain that take advantage of this legal loophole that serve cannabis users who do not want to get their drugs from the streets.

This is all too common in American workplaces, especially in industries where jobs are inflexible and physically demanding—and more likely to be held by low-income women, women of color, or immigrant women. That's why I support the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which requires employers to provide reasonable workplace accommodations when their employees' abilities are limited by pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition.

Under Reagan, America drastically ramped up defense spending in a successful bid to bring down the Soviet Union. Despite the strong economy, Wall Street suffered its worst day ever under Reagan. The Dow plunged an astonishing 22.6% on Black Monday — equaling about 5,500 points today.

Since Ocasio-Cortez has not yet offered a detailed formal proposal, the center has not calculated how much additional revenue raising the top rate to 70% could bring in. But it's likely that high earners would try to shift their income into capital gains – by being paid in stock, deferring compensation or other methods – in order to minimize the tax hit, Gleckman said.

President Joe Biden and the Democrats who now control Congress could earn respect, if not votes, for telling coal country the truth -- that coal must be phased out of the national energy mix, but that workers will not be left behind. That means they should get job training, health care, wage replacement and, when possible, jobs in the new industries that are popping up to replace fossil fuels. This suite of policy solutions is complex, but they must be taken seriously, and the discussion must forward the voices of fossil-fuel workers. Workers need to know that climate advocates respect and support them before we can move forward.
I think there have been times -- there have been times where our Democratic Party did not reach out as aggressively as we could to evangelicals, for example, because the assumption was, well, they don't agree with us on choice, or they don't agree with us on gay rights, and so we just shouldn't show up. And when you don't show up, if you're not going to church, then you're not talking to church folk. And that means that people have a very right-wing perspective in terms of what faith means and of defining our faith.
By contrast, learning the truth about the last four years and holding key actors responsible is essential to restoring the rule of law, the integrity of our political institutions and to meaningful movement beyond the Trump era.

However, you could split the process up over several years to keep from pushing yourself into a much higher tax bracket and to limit the amount of taxes you must pay at one time.

More than 32,000 L.A. teachers and staff are set to walk off the job today. It's the first strike in 30 years for the school district, which is the second-largest in the nation.

Despite the strike, classes will still be held at L.A. schools. The district's 600,000 students will be taught by reassigned administrators and substitute teachers.

They must look to provide affordable health care for every American. While some major Democratic candidates for president in 2020 favored a Medicare for All plan , President-elect Joe Biden has vowed instead to add the public option to Obamacare -- reviving a measure that failed to pass in 2010. But we are long past the time for policy tinkering with the health of Americans. Of those who insist that Medicare For All is unaffordable we should ask another question: How can we afford not to? Medicare For All would increase jobs, employment and tax revenue through massive public investments that could increase worker productivity, economic mobility and ensure that families and children's health care would not be tied to a single job or eliminated amidst a pandemic.

Amid so much economic suffering and despair, when many Americans have lost faith in their government -- and when millions are prepared to accept lies about the outcome of the 2020 presidential election -- it is imperative that Democrats pass a bold and aggressive economic agenda within the first 100 days of Joe Biden's presidency. Now is not the time to think small. It is the time to think big and to restore faith among working families -- Black, White, Latino, Asian American and Native American -- that in a democratic society, government can respond to their needs.
The New York criminal investigation has been slowed by a fight over the President's tax records , a scrum that is again before the Supreme Court.

The one thing I do have to say, though, about this issue is, it is very important for us, I think, to deal with this problem in terms of thousands of -- hundreds of thousands of people coming over the borders on a regular basis if we want to also provide opportunity for the 12 million undocumented workers who are here.

Coming at a moment of national uncertainty, the debate underscored the very different positions the two candidates find themselves in right now as Biden has surged ahead of Sanders in delegates.

That program and others failed to fully address the full needs of these communities, according to policy experts I interviewed.

Reagan claimed that he wanted to stop deficit spending, but his 1981 tax cuts increased the deficits (from 2.5% of GDP in 1981 to 5.9% of GDP in 1983), as did the 2001 tax cut under former President George W. Bush and the 2017 tax cut under Trump. Over time, the various tax cuts were not matched by offsetting spending cuts, since broad areas of federal spending were -- and continue to be -- very strongly backed by the public. In fact, according to the Pew Research Center, in 2019, there were strong majorities supporting increased government spending on many domestic priorities, including education, infrastructure and the environment.

As stocks look for further gains in 2020, investors are keeping an eye on the presidential race. According to Stovall's research, if the S&P 500 rises between July 31 and October 31 in an election year, the incumbent candidate wins 80% of the time.

J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo George W. Bush Investors who bet that a businessman in the White House would translate into strong returns were badly disappointed during President George W. Bush's presidency. The S&P 500 declined 40% under Bush, the worst among modern administrations. Bush inherited the dotcom bust, which spawned the 2001 recession. The downturn was deepened by the 9/11 terror attacks. Growth gathered steam in 2004 and 2005, fueled in part by low interest rates and the housing boom. But that bubble also popped in spectacular fashion, ushering in the Great Recession and the scariest financial crisis in a generation. In the final quarter of Bush's tenure, GDP plummeted at an 8.4% annual rate. Unemployment began rising rapidly. The S&P 500 plummeted 38% in 2008, its worst year since the Great Depression. 1st term -12% Jan. 20, 2001 – Jan. 20, 2005 2nd term -31% Jan. 20, 2005 – Jan. 20, 2009

Finally, understand that taxes are only one element of smart money management. Holding onto a risky stock an extra month in the hope of turning short-term gains into tax-favored long-term gains might sound smart — unless the stock plunges and those gains suddenly turn into losses.
Allo, who said he was one of the people who nominated Ahmed for the prize, emphasized that even Ahmed did not save any country, though Ahmed did do some really amazing things. Both Eritrea and Ethiopia would have continued to exist with or without the deal, Allo said.

If Biden -- perhaps thinking that he might get a Supreme Court appointment in the near term, perhaps from a retirement of Justice Stephen Breyer — wants to take a page from the Obama/Kagan playbook he could name someone like California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger so as to prepare her for a potential seat on the high court. But Kruger may not want to leave a good job to face a bitter confirmation battle that might in short order lead to another battle for the high court.
Lee's prison sentence means the company is losing a key decision-maker at a time of strategic upheaval in some of Samsung's core industries.

The startup plans to expand from income taxes to quarterly business returns and add more tax professionals to the service. This week, the company announced an integration with Slack, which allows customers to chat with a Slackbot that creates their Taxfyle tax profile.
The Georgia races will be the first meaningful temperature check of the Republican base since Election Day and it comes in a traditionally red state that, through a combination of GOP discomfort with the President and supercharged Democratic enthusiasm, flipped to Biden as he clinched a comprehensive national victory. Whether the GOP can bring together angry Trump supporters, who have followed him down a rabbit hole of baseless election fraud conspiracies, and more buttoned-down, business-friendly Republicans could also set the tone for Trump's post-presidency -- and decide how much sway he carries with him as he leaves the White House.
You know, in Germany, it's not that dangerous, said Bastian. But still, we had those thoughts once in a while, yes. Yes, we did.
Eight years of Clinton-Gore haven't been enough to repair the damage of 12 years of Reagan and Bush, Sweeney told the crowd. Al Gore is running for president as the champion of working families and unions. From Pittsburgh, Gore heads to Louisville, Kentucky, for a rally at an outdoor motor speedway. It's the final stop on a non-stop tour that began yesterday in Philadelphia. After late night stop in Michigan, Gore and running mate Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut arrived in Florida in the pre-dawn hours of Monday. The vice president headed to an all-night coffee shop to chat with waitresses while Lieberman visited a bakery. We decided that in the wee hours of Labor Day ... we'd reconnect with our roots, Gore told a dawn rally. It was very moving for me. Gore and Lieberman later had breakfast with firefighters at a Hispanic neighborhood fire station in one of the city's busiest districts. This crowd is a crowd that looks like America, said Gore. As Gore headed for Pittsburgh, Lieberman returned to Michigan to attend a Labor Day festival in Detroit. If you ever wondered whether Michigan is central to what happens in this election, I've been here three times in the last week and twice in the last 10 hours, Lieberman told cheering union workers. Sniping continues over debates Bush and Gore have not yet agreed when and where to formally debate this fall, and the long-distance debate over the debates extended into Monday's events.

Far from chastened, the President was emboldened to believe that he could by legislative or j udicial fiat overturn the results of the 2020 election -- a free and fair vote in which he was soundly defeated
According to several sources familiar with the lunch, Trump floated the idea of a permanent payroll tax cut, but also weighed having a temporary cut that lasted for several months.
I think they may make it even better, Trump said of the Senate. Look, they're working with the House, working very much in unison like the question before. They're working to only enhance it and make it better and make it fair for everybody. And that's what we're looking to do. So we may go back and forth with the House a little bit, but both will be in a very positive fashion.
While specialty credit cards such as the Diners Club card have been around for a while, general-purpose credit cards are a more recent addition to our wallets. The first general-purpose credit card, the BankAmericard (now known as Visa), appeared on the scene in 1966. In the years since, credit cards have proliferated to the point where the average American now holds 2.6 credit cards -- and $8,377 in credit card debt.
That's exactly the thinking behind a new school of economic theory that the government should be spending more, not less.

I agree with that sentiment. In seeking a transition away from fossil fuels -- which, again, is required by science if we want to continue living on a habitable planet -- we must learn from the mistakes of the past. That's the only way America can inch closer toward justice.
MetLife (MET) attributed the problem to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.
But probably the most interesting thing about that phone call was at the end they did a question and answer segment, and they had numerous people ask about the timeline of this being issued Friday. But one person directly asked, they said this is the official White House climate report, and it says climate change is real. But you have the president of the United States saying it's not. What are we supposed to believe, the White House report or the White House spokesperson? And they refused to answer it. The moderator simply would not allow any of these panelists to answer that question. I just found that odd that these are the scientists, they wrote the report, and they're not even really allowed to answer that simple question.
On the other hand, critics of a BAT don't believe the dollar will go up enough, and they say Americans will get hurt with higher prices for clothes, TVs and computers, and no guarantee that more jobs are created.

Ms. Trump was required to recuse from participating in the implementation of the opportunity zones program.

This week, the Florida senator's team released a flurry of attack ads against New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, just as the brash governor is threatening Rubio's status as the GOP establishment's preferred candidate.
Bottom line: Whatever judges, tax cuts and electoral victories Trump bestowed on Republicans over the last four years isn't enough right now to keep Majority Leader Mitch McConnell or House Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney quietly tethered to him. They're signaling they're done. They're over him. And we can't emphasize enough that we are just at the beginning of the story of what the Republican Party becomes without Trump.

In the years since, she continues, we've seen an administration align itself with white supremacists at home and cozy up to dictators abroad; rip babies from their mothers' arms in grotesque violation of their human rights; give corporations and the wealthy huge tax cuts while ignoring the middle class; derail our fight against climate change; sabotage health care and imperil a woman's right to control her own body; all while lashing out at seemingly everything and everyone, including the very idea of a free and independent press.

It's not just Uncle Sam who's trying to help you retire. Chances are good that, if your employer offers you access to a retirement plan like a 401(k), they also offer you some incentives to participate. Usually these incentives take the form of matching funds, whereby if you put a certain amount aside in your retirement plan, your employer will contribute some cash on top to help boost your account balance. For example, employers often offer a 50% match on contributions of up to 6% of an employee's salary. In that case, if you're setting aside 6% of your salary in your 401(k), your employer will contribute an additional amount equal to 3% of your salary.

The demonization? He has claimed the Dow would be 5,000 to 10,000 points higher if not for the Federal Reserve raising interest rates.

Allow insurers to sell plans that cover less of the costs. Obamacare created four tiers of coverage, each with a requirement to cover a certain share of policyholders' costs, on average. The bill would eliminate this rule. Presumably, insurers would be able to offer plans with higher deductibles and co-pays. However, since the legislation does not lift the cap on out-of-pocket expenses, insurers could not require consumers to pay more than that for covered services. The deductibles for many bronze-tier plans are already pegged to that cap.
The tax break for PPP loan recipients just got bigger. While the loans will be tax-free for recipients if they're used for authorized purposes, the latest Covid relief package sweetened the pot further.

But once Trump won the White House, the industry saw him as a vehicle for the pro-business agenda they craved -- especially on tax cuts.
Every cross-party transition raises these kinds of issues, but this one seems different in two respects, said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. First, the court has an unusually high number of cases challenging the old administration's policies on its docket this term, raising the specter that a number of those cases go away if and when the new administration rescinds them. Second, the Trump administration has been unusually aggressive in its litigation posture before the Justices -- whereas the Biden administration may be inclined to move slower on high-profile, hot-button cases.
Governors both Republican and Democrat have acknowledged Madigan as the real power in Illinois politics -- through his ability to singularly control the fate of legislation and dictate the vote of his members being key to any politician's agenda.

In 2017, you can defer up to $18,000 of your salary to your 401(k) and contribute as much as $5,500 to your IRA -- the same amount as last year. (Once you're 50 or older, those caps increase to $24,000 in a 401(k) and $6,500 in an IRA.)
That gives us a unique opportunity in this election, and what we can't do, I think, is just to take the playing field as a given. We want to expand the scope of the electorate so that we can start getting a 60 percent majority, more folks in the House, more folks in the Senate, and I think that's something I can do.
According to two sources familiar with the discussions, Democrats will include a provision in their new bill that would require presidential nominees to disclose 10 years of tax returns shortly after they become the nominee. Vice presidents would also be required to disclose a decade of returns. The tax returns would then be posted on the Federal Election Commission's website for public viewing.
One of my central platforms in this campaign is we're going to provide a $4,000 tuition credit every student, every year, but in exchange for giving something back.

I think there are a lot of creative ways where we can provide opportunities than exist right now.

During his final hours in office there was a frantic debate underway behind the scenes on whether to grant Bannon a pardon.

Moreover, when families can't cut back on costs, they take on debt, which can make rebounding harder in the long run. Surveys of middle- and low-income households show higher uses of credit cards to cover basic living expenses, such as rent or utilities, than their higher-income counterparts, and carry a balance that accrues interest, adding to their financial burden.

His claims make sense as a matter of bombastic Trumpian politics. All presidential incumbents surf positive economic developments on their watch in asking voters for another term.

How to fix it: The earlier you start saving for retirement, the easier it will be: Money that sits in your retirement account for decades has plenty of time to be fruitful and multiply. If you didn't start saving right away, though, your case is definitely not hopeless. You'll just have to work a little harder to squeeze more cash out of your budget and be disciplined about paying yourself first. Luckily, workers today have access to powerful tax-advantaged retirement accounts, like 401(k)s and IRAs, that can help maximize whatever savings they manage to accrue.

Health insurance is a perk because the money you contribute toward your health care is not taxable. The money you are contributing to an employer-sponsored 401(k) or other retirement fund is also not subject to income tax withholding. Your employer may also contribute to your fund, which is great -- free money! You do not have to pay income or payroll taxes on the employer contribution. But you will need to pay taxes when you take the money out of the fund down the line.
It will also likely mark the first time Trump will be in the same room as some of his Democratic opponents running for president.

At the end of the day, whole life insurance is more likely to be utilized by higher-net-worth individuals since the premiums are so much more expensive, but it can be an asset for anyone who wants to make sure money is left behind for their heirs. So while you'll pay more for permanent life insurance, the peace of mind can be worth the cost.

Without being certain of the results in Florida, we simply cannot be certain of the results of the national election, Daley announced shortly after 4 a.m. EST. Gore already had called Bush to congratulate him on his win, when the tightening numbers in Florida prompted him to call again and retract those comments. Daley said Gore and his running mate, Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, were prepared to concede and support Bush if he is officially elected. But this race is simply too close to call, and until the recount is concluded and the results in Florida become official, our campaign continues, Daley said as the crowd roared its approval. Daley said about 5,000 votes remained to be counted in Florida in addition to a recount. I've been in politics a long time, and I don't think there's ever been a night like this one, Daley said. Meanwhile, in the nationwide popular vote, with 97 percent of precincts in, Gore led Bush by 49 to 48 percent. Gore had collected 47,744,437 votes across the country, while Bush had 47,480,638, according to CNN's count. The white-knuckle race appeared to lean Gore's way early in the night, as news organizations projected Gore the winner in Florida based on exit polling. Along with Gore victories in Pennsylvania, Michigan, New York and Illinois, that gave the vice president a large lead in the Electoral College count.

But there's some good news: The IRS allows taxpayers to claim a number of deductions without actually itemizing on their returns.

Therefore, they can continue holding the Roth and are not required to take distributions from it during their lifetime either, thereby allowing it to grow tax-free for even longer if they wish.
With unyielding commitment, we are curbing the opioid epidemic -- drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years.

Talking about a January 2016 incident in which Navy sailors were detained by Iran after they strayed into Iranian territorial waters, Trump said, But you remember the 10 sailors that were 15 feet across that line, probably they weren't -- they don't even know if they were in Iranian waters, but they said they were slightly in Iranian waters, so they humiliated them. -- January 6 interview with Rush Limbaugh

The simplest way to manage this feat is to reduce your taxable income. That doesn't mean asking your boss for a pay cut -- rather, the idea is to make part of your income exempt from taxation.

In one sense, it's easy for President Biden to announce on the first day he's in office that the US will rejoin, said Jody Freeman, a Harvard law professor who served as counselor for energy and climate change in the White House under President Barack Obama.

Facts First: Trump's grammar makes this claim a little hard to fact check -- he seemed to go back and forth from boasting about the past to boasting about the present -- but he obviously does not already have the best jobs record of any president. In fact, thanks to the steep job losses of the pandemic era, he leaves office with the US : Trump's grammar makes this claim a little hard to fact check -- he seemed to go back and forth from boasting about the past to boasting about the present -- but he obviously does not already have the best jobs record of any president. In fact, thanks to the steep job losses of the pandemic era, he leaves office with the US at about 3 million fewer jobs than when he took office. No other president in the post-World War II era, the period for which we have good official data, has had a negative jobs record.

Corporations have the resources and the willingness to think of litigation as just the cost of doing business.

It takes money to bring lawsuits, and they have the money to bring the lawsuits.
Using these strategies wisely can save you huge amounts of tax. Yet by being aware that they can cause unintended problems if you're not careful, you'll be able to take full advantage of these strategies while avoiding the downsides.

Student debts are $1.68 trillion , owed by an astounding 44.7 million borrowers. And climate change has plunged the nation into crises of mega-forest fires, coastal flooding, extreme storms, droughts and heatwaves. The year 2020 tied for the world's warmest on record, an astounding 1.25° Celsius above the pre-industrial temperature -- with worse to come.

Those regions have seen a run of good economic luck. Most of them didn't overheat during the housing bubble, and thus didn't fall too hard during the crash. As the recession wore on, agricultural areas were bolstered by high prices for corn and soybeans. These economies relied on some manufacturing, but few whole towns depended on it or suffered terribly as factories disappeared, like those in Michigan and Ohio. The upper Midwest has also largely managed to escape the opioid epidemic that has swept through the rest of rural America.

The current Collective Bargaining Agreement was agreed to in November 2016. One of the chief issues since has been the $197 million competitive balance tax (better known as luxury tax) on each club's payroll that this winter effectively acted as a salary cap.

That's no small part of the reason stars such as Eric Hosmer (Padres), J.D.

The agitation level is high.

The fundamental flaw in the US tax system is that we tax wages, not wealth. If America were to follow Rep. Ocasio-Cortez's lead, high income workers would be facing higher taxes, up to 70% for those with more than $10 million of taxable income. Many upper-income earners would be tempted to move, or retire, or shift their financial plans to show fewer wages and all of them, as workers, are shouldering a hefty tax burden as is. Meantime, the truly rich, who do not have to work, or work in the ways ordinary folk do, would continue to pay nothing on their accumulated wealth. That's crazy.

Gore's campaign rejected the Texas governor's offer on Sunday to participate in three presidential debates -- two of which would take place on television shows. Gore insisted Monday that Bush must first accept the three 90-minute debates proposed by the Commission on Presidential Debates. This is not about what is best for George W. Bush or what is best for Al Gore. It's about what's best for the American people, said Gore, who argued that commission debates will reach the widest possible viewing audience. Under the Bush camp's proposals, presidential debates would take place on NBC's Meet the Press, hosted by Tim Russert, and CNN's Larry King Live. The third would be hosted by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which has organized the quadrennial face-offs since 1988. On Monday, the Bush campaign emphasized that Gore, regarded by many as a skilled and seasoned debater, had already accepted the CNN and NBC offers among dozens of others. My opponent said he would debate me anyplace, anytime, anywhere, Bush said. I said, 'Fine. Why don't we just show up ... and discuss our differences?' All of a sudden the words 'anytime, anywhere' don't mean anything. In addition to the three debates featuring the presidential candidates, Bush's campaign proposed two between their running mates. But Gore campaign chairman William Daley said the Republican presidential candidate's debate plan would shortchange Americans by cutting tens of millions of people out of the presidential debate audience, and Gore called Bush's plan a disappointment.

In 2020, a record-breaking 22 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters -- including unprecedented wildfires in the American West -- caused a total of $95 billion in damages across the country.
However, the substantive point that impeachment would not allow the country to move forward is deeply flawed. It suggests the choice is between either moving forward toward restoring some kind of normalcy or remaining focused on the Trump era and adjudicating the past.
Utah's Sen. Mitt Romney was pilloried by fellow Republicans for standing up against Trump in his Ukraine impeachment trial. He could have company this year, when the Senate holds its trial.

Kelton: Inflation is the relevant risk, not the size of the annual deficit. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, budget deficits rose to more than 10 percent of GDP. They were big, by historic standards, but they were nothing to worry about. In fact, most economists seem to agree that bigger (and better targeted) deficits would have helped the economy recover much more quickly. Today, the government is running annual budget deficits that are expected to reach $1 trillion. That's a lot of zeros, but so what? Remember, their red ink is our black ink. What worries me about the deficits we're running today is not their size but their nature. A big part of the reason the government is running bigger deficits right now is because Republicans voted for tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the richest Americans and large corporations. Income and wealth inequality—already at alarming levels—will only widen. So I worry about the way these deficits are being used to funnel resources to the people who least need the help.

Though you need to meet certain criteria to be eligible to contribute to a health savings account, or HSA, if you put money into such an account last year, you can use those contributions to reduce your taxable income. Among other benefits, the money that goes into HSAs gets to grow tax-free, so if you have a high-deductible plan, it pays to see whether an HSA makes sense for you going forward.

Several Republican lawmakers who are alleged to have been involved in the rally that preceded the deadly riot on the US Capitol have sought clemency from Trump before he leaves office, but after meeting with his legal advisers for several hours on Saturday, the President decided he would not grant them, according to two people familiar with his plans.

Again, it's debatable that the economy needed reviving when he took office. It's been growing for more than a decade. He did move to cut many regulations — but there are serious environmental impacts for those moves. Further, that tax cut bill, which permanently cut corporate rates and temporarily cut individual rates, has made the national deficit skyrocket to more than $1 trillion per year.

As we restore American leadership throughout the world, we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere. That is why my Administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba. We are supporting the hopes of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans to restore democracy. The United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people. But Maduro's grip of tyranny will be smashed and broken. Here this evening is a man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans. Joining us in the gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó. Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland.

Reading Georgia's 1861 secession declaration, which I found at the Library of Congress website , it strikes me that back then, secessionists were trying to repeal their association with the Constitution. Today, rioters are more likely to say they're protecting it, even though their effort to stop the counting of Georgia's electoral votes, which this year went to the candidate who made a point of rejecting racism, would actually rip the Constitution to shreds.
As the central figure in the nation's effort to deal with Trump's deceptions, lies and possible crimes, Mueller has been on the receiving end of the President's tantrums ever since he began work. If – likely when – his work product is ultimately revealed, he will have his say, and the President is likely to make us all soon look back and think that 2018 was nothing compared with what Trump's doing now.
Indeed. And as Trump produces this scene, his concern for the hundreds of thousands of furloughed government workers is lost, taking a back seat to his star, the wall. Kind of like Atlantic City 30 years ago when he was building other monuments to himself, inconspicuously named The Taj Mahal, for instance. The gilded splendor marketed as Trump mattered the most; paying the contractors what they were owed took a back seat. Always.

Washington may think that saying anything about the other side, no matter how false, no matter how malicious, is just part of the game.

Another is the idea that, in the last talks, the union fumbled some key issues such as payroll tax thresholds and compensatory draft picks tied to free agency to win luxury items such as extra seats on the team bus and a chef in every clubhouse.

And it just hurts that after I chose T.O. over McNabb as far as who was right in a situation, he had to go with McNabb.

Part of the hesitation from the oil industry likely comes from the anticipation of regulations from the incoming Biden administration, which has included protecting the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in its climate plan.

When should you skip life insurance? Most experts agree there are situations where you may not need life insurance at all.

AVLON: I think that is the cold comfort we can take is that we're living through a civic stress test. But the president's worst impulses, his most autocratic and, you know, vengeful impulses. And those of his senior aides on some of these issues are being contained by administration officials, some of whom are Trump appointees, some of whom are simply people who've dedicated their life to serving the people of the United States.

Trump has set himself apart for his style of communication, including freewheeling speeches and speaking off the cuff in an informal manner. He threw out personal insults, cursed publicly, and regularly repeated mistruths. He used Twitter to govern and issue directives, appeal directly to his supporters, and spread conspiracies. He amplified the cultural wars, stoked racial divisions, and emboldened right wing extremism.
Ueland and Mnuchin told reporters that the House bill, which the treasury secretary negotiated with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, should be passed immediately despite the concerns among some Republicans that the measure could hurt small businesses.

Revelations that the disease was only one step removed from the President himself underlined how its advance could put any American at risk and are unlikely to quell public anxiety. They also underscore the elevated risk to politicians whose work necessarily brings them into contact with large numbers of people -- especially in the heat of a general election year.

It's true that Biden criticized Bush's approach to diplomacy in the lead-up to the war, that Biden warned in the lead-up to the war that Bush was not being honest about how hard the war would be, and that he criticized Bush's handling of the war from its first weeks on. But, again, Biden made clear that he supported the war despite that criticism.

Preliminary estimates by the private data analytics firm the Rhodium Group show US emissions did plummet by 10% last year, the largest drop since World War II .

Some of my critics say that the reason that prices are falling is that the outlook for world growth has slowed. Note that this is the opposite of the overheating argument. But let us assume that slow global growth, or even a global recession, were coming. In that case, and if one believes in the Phillips Curve , there is no case for the recent rate hikes.

Talking about the wall will clearly be one of Trump's go-to tactics for deflecting attention from the 17 known investigations into his administration, family and his business. Having won election by stirring up hate and fear of immigrants, Trump can be counted on to keep fearmongering – at a higher decibel – as special counsel Robert Mueller, prosecutors around the country and Congressional committees issue reports and subpoenas and demands for documents.

Politics is not a game. It is the most serious of business. We have seen that over the last seven years. We have seen what a difference it makes when we have a president who is indifferent to and insensitive about the real-life struggles of Americans, and I want to be the champion that once again gives Americans the feeling that they have a president who cares about them and can produce results for them. And that's what I intend to do.
However, with a Roth IRA, the money you contribute into the account has already been taxed. Then, as long as you follow some basic account requirements, including having a Roth account open for at least five years, everything you earn within the account will grow tax-free and remain tax-free even when you take a distribution. So, if you put in $5 and it grows to $10 -- that $5 of growth is yours, tax-free.

In a February 2003 speech in Delaware, before the war began, Biden said, Let everyone here be absolutely clear: I supported the resolution to go to war. I am NOT opposed to war to remove weapons of mass destruction from Iraq. I am NOT opposed to war to remove Saddam from those weapons if it comes to that. In a July 2003 speech at the Brookings Institution, after the war began, Biden said: Nine months ago, I voted with my colleagues to give the president of the United States of America the authority to use force and I would vote that way again today. It was the right vote then and would be a correct vote today.

As the partial government shutdown rolls into its 16th day – and negotiations with Congressional Democrats to end it appear to be at a standstill – President Trump mulls an unprecedented move. Trump says he might wield his presidential powers to declare a national emergency to bypass Congress and build his border wall, using Defense Department funds. That idea generated immediate pushback from Democrats, and it's almost guaranteed to generate a legal challenge.

The administration of Chief Executive Carrie Lam is seeking to put a floor under the collapsing economy, rolling out the boldest budget in recent years after criticism of government inertia. Months of political unrest over China's role in the city pushed Hong Kong last year into its first annual recession in a decade, with economists forecasting a second annual contraction in 2020 as disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak further depress output.
I wonder, as you see the president, as you see the attorney general, as you see, for instance, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee in the Senate, Ron Johnson, talking about all these possible conspiracies in 2016, who's minding the store now for 2020?

When they latched themselves to Trump, they did so for good and for bad. This moment – a flailing President unwilling to see he made a bad bet and who keeps throwing good political money after bad – was completely predictable.

After Harris became attorney general of California, many criminal justice advocates in the state were disappointed that she did not take a more active role to advocate for ballot measures and legislation changing California's three strikes law, even though she had been a strong critic of the harsh sentencing penalties before she was elected.

Warnock is the first Black man ever elected to the Senate from Georgia. Until this week, Republicans held every statewide elective office and majorities in both houses of the legislature. Until last November, when Biden edged President Trump here, Georgia was a reliably red state.
The fact is, the Trump economy looks a lot like the Obama recovery before it. But the president has employed a mix of exaggeration, truth and demonization to declare the US economy the the best it's ever been. That's one of many exaggerations. The economy has grown more strongly many times before: the industrial boom post World War II, during the Clinton years and after the Great Recession.
So, for example, if you have total retirement savings of $1 million and inflation is running at 2% a year, you would withdraw $40,000, or 4% of your $1 million, the first year of retirement, $40,800 the second year, $41,600 the third, $42,450 the fourth, and so forth. Following the 4% rule doesn't guarantee that you won't run out of money. But sticking to this schedule of withdrawals should provide a reasonable level of assurance that your nest egg will last at least 30 years, which, as this longevity calculator shows, is about how long you should plan for your money to support you in retirement given today's long lifespans.

Many other towers thought to be at risk of a similar incident are subsidized and mixed-use housing blocks, whose occupants complain of longstanding neglect by the authorities.
I think it's quite interesting that he has demanded a loyalty test from so many Republicans and then when they are loyal to him -- and there is one incident, one statement -- and he is the first one to throw those loyal individuals under the bus, Murkowski told CNN. That's not loyalty as I know loyalty, added the Alaska Republican, who's no stranger to internecine contests, having been defeated in a 2010 GOP primary only to win another term in a write-in campaign that year.

SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): If the whistleblower's allegations are turned into an impeachment article, it's imperative that the whistleblower be interviewed in public under oath and cross-examined.

Universal life insurance is another type of permanent coverage that combines a death benefit with a cash value component. Customers with universal life can rely on the cash value of their policy for a loan, but they can also withdraw funds over time. The cash value also earns interest that's based on market rates, which means the amount of interest you can earn will fluctuate.

Abroad, America's greatest source of strength has always been our ideals. The same is true at home. We find unity in our incredible diversity, drawing on the promise enshrined in our Constitution, the notion that we're all created equal, that no matter who you are or what you look like, if you abide by the law, you should be protected by it, if you adhere to our common values, you should be treated no different than anyone else.
Facts First: There is no basis for the claim that there has been fighting over the Turkey-Syria border for 1,000 years; modern-day Turkey and Syria were both part of the Ottoman Empire that was only dissolved after World War I, and the border between them is less than 100 years old.

We estimate that this is one of the single biggest climate actions the U.S. has taken in at least in a decade, said Kate Larsen, the director of the Rhodium Group's international energy and climate research team. When you look at the remaining policy rollbacks that Trump implemented and that will remain standing, these are largely equivalent to making up the damage that the Trump administration has done in terms of regulatory rollbacks.
Being associated with an offshore account – as the journalists say the Panama Papers show Makhlouf was – is not in and of itself illegal. And the journalists do not speculate what the money in Makhlouf's accounts would have been used for.
What this isn't: McConnell isn't signaling here that he plans to bring the Senate back into session and hold an impeachment trial before Biden is sworn in next week. McConnell has made it clear that a trial is going to fall squarely in the incoming Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's lap. McConnell is still a Republican. It's still in Republicans' best interest politically to slow Biden's agenda. But, as CNN reported Tuesday, McConnell is telling people that impeachment could make it easier to rid the GOP of Trump. McConnell is having conversations with Biden over the rules that would govern a trial. McConnell isn't closing the door on his own vote, and he is signaling -- very strongly -- that if a member wants to vote to remove Trump from office, it sure would make it easier for the party to rid itself of Trump's legacy forever.

I saw it, and it made me mad, Harris writes. I have too many memories of my brilliant mother, a breast cancer researcher who migrated from India to go to graduate school, being treated as though she were dumb because of her accent. Memories of her being followed around a department store with suspicion, because surely a brown-skinned woman like her couldn't afford the dress or the blouse she had chosen.

Cummings and his fellow Democrats in the House will also possess the power of impeachment, which, if exercised, would result in a referral to the Senate for a trial that could force Trump from office. Thus far, Democrats don't seem likely to move for impeachment, but this could change if Mueller's investigators produce court filings or a report that implicates the President in the Russian interference in the 2016 election.

That sure seems like a lot of money, but most accounts are far from able to support anyone in retirement. For example, the average 401(k) account balance in Fidelity Investments-managed plans hit a record average of $92,500 as of the end of 2016. Indeed, income from 401(k) accounts has been estimated to represent about 25% to 30% of overall retirement income.

House Speaker Paul Ryan has a direct line to incoming chief of staff and fellow Wisconsin Republican Reince Priebus, one he uses often, and has said repeatedly that he speaks to Trump by phone a few times per week.

But the central bank, which also took steps to boost liquidity, did not push interest rates deeper into negative territory, a move that some investors had been expecting.

HUNT: Jim, the Russians have been very helpful in getting materials to the Iranian nuclear program. The Bush administration has said recently that the Russians now appreciate the danger and are being more cooperative with our interests in not getting as much material to the -- to Iran.

Mississippi is a textbook example of why a large Black populace doesn't necessarily translate into political power. It has the highest percentage of Black people in any state -- about 38% -- but they are virtually locked out the state's political power. It doesn't have Georgia's booming economy or its influx of multiracial, college-educated transplants who tend to be progressive voters. White Republicans have dominated state politics in Mississippi since the late 19th century.
Until recently anyone who uttered such a statement would have been deemed mad. This past week, however, Ken Livingstone, former mayor of London and a member of Parliament, did just that, saying Hitler was supporting Zionism while surrounded by reporters and cameras.

Lifestyle planning, or thinking seriously about how you actually want to spend your time once you leave your job behind, is an important part of any retirement plan. It's especially crucial, however, if you're contemplating early retirement. After all, by retiring early you could easily be looking at a post-career life that will last as long, if not longer, than your career. Thus, if for no other reason than to avoid boredom or the feeling that you're just marking time, you'll want to do all you can to make this stage of your life rewarding and fulfilling.

5. The Keystone XL pipeline, which would deliver more than 800,000 barrels of petroleum daily from the Canadian oil sands to refineries on the US Gulf Coast, was blocked by the Obama administration in 2015. Trump did not agree with that decision and made it a bone of contention during the campaign. Here's what he said last January in Iowa:
And so going forward, and as you have seen throughout this campaign, Biden has really pushed back against that notion that there has been this leftward tilt in the party.
The money is then allocated into three categories: spending (that money can be transferred to a Visa card), saving (kids can save it in cash or buy fractional shares of stock) and sharing (this money goes toward the causes and charities of their choice).
That's a sharp contrast to the White House's latest blueprint, which projects that the deficit will shrink to $261 billion by 2030. The President's budget assumes that the economy will grow at around 3% annually during that period of time helping to narrow the gap. Those estimates are significantly higher than what most economists anticipated along with the Federal Reserve.

Repeal the individual and employer mandates. The GOP's bill would get rid of the Obamacare requirement that people must have health coverage or face a tax penalty. It would also eliminate the requirement that employers with at least 50 employees provide health insurance to their workers. Under Obamacare, these companies were required to provide affordable insurance to staffers who work more than 30 hours a week. They would face a penalty if they did not meet this criteria and their employee sought subsidies on the exchanges. These provisions take effect retroactively to 2016.

The IRS actually provides quite a few ways to transform taxable income into nontaxable income. They're called deductions. Yes, that's what a deduction really is -- a way to flag a piece of income as nontaxable. It's how the federal government rewards you for spending money in ways that it deems beneficial to society. The trick to maximizing your deductions is planning them out in advance so that you can be sure to reach your goal ($12,050 in this example).
But perhaps his term will be mostly remembered for his adoption of forgotten Americans in midwestern and southern cities hollowed out by globalized free trade policies. Trump powerfully identified a populace badly neglected by Washington politicians of both parties -- as well as an audience for his populist, nationalist politics. But the facts suggest the President's tax cuts and economic policies in practice did more for corporations and rich cronies that the heartland Americans he championed.

So you should think of the 4% rule only as a way to estimate how much you can withdraw from your nest egg if you want your savings to last throughout retirement. The rule isn't meant to ensure you'll have enough income to live on. Depending on the size of your nest egg and other resources, a 4% withdrawal rate could be just right for your needs, fall short of them or generate more income than you actually require.

James Skoufis, a Democratic state senator representing New York's 39th district since 2019, voted for the bail reform law, but has publicly acknowledged the laws' frailties. He has become an outspoken advocate for amending the law, attempting to build a coalition in the state senate to debate a complicated amendment to address some of the glitches. When I asked him why he had been a signatory to a bill so obviously fraught with inadequacies, Skoufis highlighted one of the major impediments to voting clean, single-item bills in legislative bodies: The vote [was] more complicated. There was no up or down vote on bail reform. It was in an enormous budget bill. In the same bill was all school funding, the property tax cap, STAR [New York State School Tax Relief Program], and lots and lots of other stuff. If the bill was voted down, government would've effectively shut down.

Newspapers make their picks Meanwhile, third-party candidates touted the importance of their role in U.S. politics. Natural Law Party candidate John Hagelin said on NBC's Meet The Press, Third parties in America have always done the most important things. All of the important innovations came from third parties. The right of women to vote, abolition of slavery, child labor laws, a balanced budget: These ideas and most others came from third party candidates. Libertarian Party candidate Harry Browne said on the same program that voting Republican or Democratic means you're giving up. You're saying I'll never be free, I'm never going to have a smaller government. I'm going to pay income tax for the rest of my life. I'm going to pay Social Security for the rest of my life. So I'm just going to vote for whoever will take me to hell at the slowest possible rate, he said. Newspapers on Sunday began lining up behind the candidates, with The Washington Post, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, The (Minneapolis) Star-Tribune and The San Francisco Chronicle endorsing Gore.

First, the IRS will have to calculate each person's payment amount. Then, it will need the correct direct deposit information or mailing addresses. To get the money to people who don't usually file tax returns, it might have to request that information from the Social Security Administration or Veterans Affairs.

Trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that 27 years is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason.
However, these requirements do not apply to the Roth IRA. In fact, you are never required to take distributions from your Roth.

But the new system not only records what's going on; it analyzes the traffic, recognizing the different types of boats, from gondola to a topo -- essentially a water-truck.

As Espinal stated in a Freelancers Union email press release Friday afternoon, This bill is an incredible victory for the millions of freelancers who are unable to work due to this crisis.

He criticized Bush's proposal to partially privatize Social Security, saying Bush has promised about $1 trillion from the Social Security Trust Fund to two groups of people: younger workers, who would be allowed to privately invest a share of their payroll taxes; and older Americans who need that money to pay current benefits. Gore promised to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, the federal medical insurance program for seniors --- and he has tried to cast doubts upon the Texas governor's ability to handle the complexities of the job. Gore and President Clinton credited their administration's eight-year federal budgeting strategy for turning the recession of the early 1990s into an atmosphere that has brought about the balanced budget agreement, some 22 million new jobs, and low rates of unemployment in most regions of the country. Bush -- whose father was ousted by Clinton in 1992 in the wake of the last national economic downturn -- argues that though the economy has shown improvement since his father left office, the reasons have little -- to nothing at all -- to do with Gore or Clinton. But with voters unlikely to want broad economic reforms, Bush chose instead to focus on other sensitive areas for overhaul. Those include the public education system; the armed forces; the 35-year-old Medicare health insurance program; and Social Security.

I've got that, you know, clearly in my economic blueprint, which is something that I've published the last few days, because it's part of what we have to do again.

Walk past the towering skyscrapers of the Central Business District and along the Singapore River down to Boat Quay.

(CNN) We're looking at a second impeachment of President Donald Trump . The process will be different this time, both for the lawmakers sitting in judgment of Trump and for the man himself.

For now, price hikes shouldn't be a big concern. It's good news for Main Street: We're getting paid more. Finally.
This year, discretionary spending for federal agencies was not passed in one single 'omnibus' spending package like it has been in the recent past. Some agencies, like the Defense Department, had their funding bills passed before the end of 2018. Each agency has a separate appropriations process. 2018 was the first year in more than a decade that some of the congressional appropriations bills were passed on time. That's why only certain agencies are shut down.
Shorter three- or four-night stays are also available late in the season.
When there are professed interests by upwards of a third of the clubs [to rebuild instead of compete in 2018], if some of what we're seeing and hearing is to be believed, that's a concern. It's a concern because we all have a vested interest in the excitement around Opening Day, around the excitement, around the possibilities that exist because the ball does bounce funny ways sometimes. And so when that many teams say, intimate or suggest a salary dump, you just hope there isn't an adverse effect on the industry as a whole.
Below is a fact check of 11 false claims Greene has tweeted in the last month alone, including three related claims about the integrity of the election.

Once you've established a near-term safety net, it's time to focus on the future. If your employer offers a 401(k), you're in luck, because all you need to do to participate is decide how much of each paycheck you wish to contribute, and that amount will automatically get deducted (pre-tax) from your earnings. It's as simple as that.

JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good morning. It is not the only thing, Martin. This really is the last month that the president will be enjoying a full Republican control of the House and Senate.

That sentiment was echoed by members of the public, who made the phrase As a Texan trend on Twitter on the day the ethics complaint was filed, with one person tweeting, for example, As a Texan, as an American, I'm outraged in the treasonous actions from @SenTedCruz to incite an armed insurrection at the Capitol. @tedcruz resigning is an easy out, he must be expelled.

Grassley spokesman Taylor Foy said, As a matter of routine, we don't discuss sensitive third-party material during ongoing investigations. It's unfortunate that Democrats whom we've kept in the loop on our investigations would recklessly seek to interfere with legitimate government oversight.
OBAMA: But it also means using our military wisely. And on what I believe was the single most important foreign policy decision of this generation, whether or not to go to war in Iraq, I believe I showed the judgment of a commander in chief. And I think that Senator Clinton was wrong in her judgments on that.
Should you file and end up owing money to the IRS for 2014, then you will have to pay a late filing penalty, which can be steep. It amounts to 5% of the tax past due every month — or part of a month — for five months, capping out at 25%. You will also have to pay a late payment penalty as well.
A medical support team has also been sent to Oakdale and hundreds of additional Bureau of Prisons officers are expected to be deployed to hard hit facilities to cover staff shortages, Carvajal said.
These facts are indisputable: Trump destroyed millions of people's faith in the US political system by refusing to accept his election defeat and inciting an insurrection against Congress. He inspired radical, far right White nationalists. He lied every day. His beautiful health care plan was a sick myth. He torched America's global reputation. And he incessantly exploited his job to boost his business, reversing President John Kennedy's admonition, Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country.
TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE WASHINGTON POST: Yes, this is actually very similar to something President Trump said during the 2016 rate, where he was talking about healthcare and providing universal health care. And he said, I'm not going to let people die in the streets.

You said When doctors make recommendations about salt intake, no one accuses us of being anti- sodium, no one tells us to stay in our lane. Seeking to reduce bullet intake doesn't make us anti-gun, it makes us pro-health. If you could sit with somebody from the NRA today, what would you want them to understand about what your intentions are here?

Still, that was then. The Brazil of 2016 is a more polarized country dealing with a far deeper economic slump. Fixing the hole in the budget and streamlining the bureaucracy will in practice mean sizable spending cuts, potential tax increases and the loss of privileges for certain special interest groups. Most of those measures will require the support of Congress – Temer cannot do them alone. As such, he will have only the narrowest of windows to convince Brazilian society that he is not a cruel neoliberal out to do the bidding of elites on Wall Street and elsewhere.

Markets are certainly betting on that – pushing Brazil's stock market up about 35% so far this year. Indeed, Temer is likely to surround himself with talented economic officials who Wall Street knows and respects.

It does not seem to be at this point that the crowd is dispersing, but on the other hand the overall crowd is substantially smaller than the crowds that gathered in France a week ago. This started with a crowd of 230,000 people across the country. Today according to the interior minister it's about 23,000. So a substantially less number of protesters out, but these on the Champs- Elysees have been far more dramatic than we saw last week, in fact probably as dramatic as I've ever seen on the Champs-Elysees.

In contrast to the tough talk on Friday, the Bush administration today sent out a more restrained message to China: It's now more important to look ahead than to continue exchanging bitter recriminations over the April 1st collision between a U.S. surveillance plane and a Chinese fighter.

Most of the Jersey Shore crew reunited for Jersey Shore Family Vacation which premiered in April 2018 on MTV. The series follows the original ruckus housemates (except for Sammi Sweetheart Giancola) who are now in different stages of their lives. Let's catch up with the group:
The House is likely to move on impeachment this week. The timing of sending the articles over to the Senate is where this gets interesting. The House can pass articles of impeachment quickly, but it is unlikely the Senate could pull off a trial before the President's term ended. Some Democrats worry that trying him in the new Senate, which they are allowed to do, would take focus away from a new President Biden's agenda. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi can hold onto the articles of impeachment for as long as she wants. One scenario would be to hold them until after the first hundred days of the Biden Administration so as to not interfere with Covid-19 and vaccine efforts, cabinet confirmations and economic recovery initiatives.

Once upon a time, everyone worked for the same company their whole working lives, and at the end of their career they retired with a fat pension. Today, only 32% of retirees have any pension at all, and that number is trending steeply downward as employer pensions continue to vanish. That means the responsibility for financing a worker's retirement falls almost entirely on the worker. And given how bad Americans are at saving money, a lot of retirees run into serious income shortages as a result.

So perhaps the president was suggesting that the newest iteration of his tax reform proposal would offer a 0% bracket in place of a bigger standard deduction. Or maybe he was merely emphasizing the effect a larger standard deduction would have for those who don't earn much.

Many people dream of making an early exit from the work-a-day routine. But making that dream a reality can be a challenge. The reason is simple. By retiring at 55 instead of, say, 65, you not only have 10 fewer years of saving and investing to build a nest egg, that nest egg also has to support you through an extra 10 years of retirement. That double-whammy of fewer working years to save and more retirement years to spend is what makes early retirement so tough to pull off.

If you're tired of living paycheck to paycheck, then the first thing you need to do is create a budget that maps out your various expenses. Simply list your recurring bills, factor in less frequent expenses -- like that once-a-year insurance premium you pay -- and compare what you typically spend to the amount of post-tax income you bring home. If the numbers don't align -- meaning you find that you're spending down your entire paycheck, and then some -- then you'll need to start cutting back. Immediately.

Then direct the rest toward retirement and/or brokerage account investments.
Still, the S&P 500 is trading at just 14.5 times 2019's expected earnings, well below its historical average of 16 times earnings.

That tight range between the best and worst sectors is well below average — typically a positive omen for stocks the following year.

In a bit of good news for those who want more (or at least some) substance in their politics, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, is attracting attention for her proposal to raise income tax rates on upper-income earners, all the way up to 70%.

The energy industries always have been boom-and-bust, but this was a big one, said Gillette Mayor Louise Carter-King, who keeps an image of her father, who also was mayor of Gillette, hanging behind her desk. Her roots in the community are deep, and her husband works in coal. From her office window, you can see one of two coal-fired power-plants puffing smoke into the sky. It was like a perfect storm because oil went down, coal went down, natural gas -- everything. The bust was caused primarily by lower natural gas and renewable energy prices, less demand from coal-fired power plants, which continue to close, and concerns about climate-change regulations, according to economists.

Such a health crisis would have challenged any American president, but Trump downplayed the pandemic as it spread, pushed unproven treatments, flouted health recommendations, maligned his government's health experts and politicized mask-wearing.

The combined employee and employer tax rate is 12.4% of your income up to $128,400 of income, and it takes 35 years of those taxes on your earnings to qualify for your full expected benefit. Guarantees, are not cheap, no matter whether they come from the government or from an insurance company. The typical recipient of those guarantees will ultimately be the one paying for that guarantee.

Despite ongoing terrorist attacks by Al-Shabaab, defectors tell me the group is in disarray. In the past 18 months, they say several hundred men and boys have left, and there are signs of many more just waiting to leave.

Bush.
McConnell has undoubtedly been an ally, pushing through three Supreme Court justices for the President, remaking the courts and orchestrating a massive tax overhaul. Lawmakers gave Trump money for a wall. They waited out every impulse, tried hard not to see bombastic tweets, and now, if members aren't with the President on overturning the election, they are being ridiculed and attacked by him as if they never walked the line for him in the past.

The Leaf isn't particularly fun to drive, the way most EVs are. The Leaf is the mild sauce version of an electric vehicle. Part of that is because it has less power. With electric cars, bigger batteries mean more driving range, but they also mean more power and punchier acceleration. So it might be no surprise the Leaf feels less exciting.
How the Biden administration and court will proceed is an open question. The President on Wednesday ended the national emergency that the Trump administration had used to divert money for the border wall. And it is suspending the program regarding asylum seekers.

One reason for worry has been the shrinking difference between short-term and long-term bond yields. Before almost every recent recession, the so-called yield curve has inverted, meaning short-term rates are higher than long-term ones.

It would be nice for budgeting purposes if you could set an inflation-adjusted withdrawal schedule that would guarantee your money will last exactly as long as you do. But that's not realistic. For one thing, we don't know how long we'll live. And even if we did, we still don't know how the investment markets will perform. So you want to arrive at a balance between spending down your nest egg too quickly (and running out of savings while you've still got a lot of living to do) and spending it too slowly (and ending up with a huge retirement stash late in life and regretting you hadn't spent more freely earlier in retirement).
His recent comments about the dollar being too strong and that it was killing us has caused the greenback to fall over the past few weeks.
The terrorist responsible for killing Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani, who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chris's life. Soleimani was the Iranian Regime's most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq. As the world's top terrorist, Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women, and children. He directed the December assault on United States Forces in Iraq, and was actively planning new attacks. That is why, last month, at my direction, the United States Military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever.

If the year's already over and you didn't quite manage to drop into a lower tax bracket, then you have one last chance: IRA contributions made up until the deadline for the previous year's tax return can count as deductions for the previous year (usually April 15, unless that date falls on a weekend). This will only work if you're eligible to deduct IRA contributions and you haven't already maxed them out for the year, but if you meet those requirements it's a perfect last-minute save for your tax bill.

You can't get out of taking the required minimum distribution from your tax-deferred accounts unless you're willing to pay a grotesquely high 50% penalty, but you can avoid paying income taxes on that money by donating it to charity instead of keeping it yourself.

Being wealthy boils down to having more money than you need. And that's why net worth is a better determiner of wealth than income: your income doesn't say anything about how much money you have available right now, it just says how much money will be coming in on a periodic basis. Net worth is how much you have in cash and other assets to spend today, and if you have more money available to spend today than you need, you are by definition wealthy.
Governor Greg Abbott today held a press conference in Houston on the importance of election integrity legislation this session.

We've had Kosovo declaring independence, and we have had our embassy set on fire in Serbia.

A 401(k) certainly makes saving easier. The money is taken directly from your paycheck, before you get a chance to spend it elsewhere. Making contributions lowers your taxes, and some employers even match the amount you save.
Lawmakers are prone to roll their eyes when asked questions about Trump's tweets, pledge not to talk about them at all, as Sen. John McCain has done multiple times, or ignore Trump's latest surprise policy prescription entirely, as Sen. John Barrasso did Tuesday when asked about Trump's latest health care comments.

Ensuring that every family has access to safe, affordable childcare is one of the best things we can do for working parents. Everywhere I go, I meet people who say they can't afford childcare. When I'm President, parents will get up to $8,000 in tax credits to offset the cost of childcare. All 3- and 4-year-olds will be able to attend high-quality, universal prekindergarten at no cost, and after-school programs and community centers will have additional funding to serve kids when school isn't in session.

Factors more under your control that can keep your audit odds low include being neat and legible when filling out your return, reporting all income on it (including all dividends and interest that's reported on 1099 forms), and not having math errors on it that will draw the attention of the IRS. If you report having no income at all, the IRS might question that -- which is not a problem if you really did have no income. It may also question bigger-than-usual deductions such as for charitable donations or business expenses. Again, such deductions might get you audited, but they won't cause much trouble if they're legitimate and you have documentation to back them up.

Wall Street cheered GE's $11 billion deal on Monday to exit the rail business. The sale was seen as a step in the right direction and potential evidence that the worst is over for GE. The company's stock has soared 10% in May, though it remains down 12% this year.
So how is this a tax trap? The potential problem is that the exclusion is available only for property that's been used as your principal residence during at least two of the five years preceding the sale. There are special rules that reduce that requirement to just one year if you need to leave your home for long-term care in a nursing home or other institution, but failing to meet the requirement can eliminate the exclusion entirely. Moreover, if you decide to change the nature of the home to a nonqualified use -- such as renting it out -- then capital gain that's attributed to the period of nonqualified use can be taxable.

The Ecuadorian government has signaled unhappiness with its guest of almost seven years at its London embassy – setting up a will-it-or-won't-it scenario that could force Assange into US authorities' custody. Assange originally stepped inside the embassy in 2012 while wanted for questions over sexual assault allegations in Sweden. He's maintained his innocence, and since then has become a focus in Mueller's investigation of the Russian hack and public distribution of the Hillary Clinton campaign emails and information from Democratic Party computers in 2016. Justice Department investigations of Assange and his outlet WikiLeaks date to at least 2010, when the site posted files from former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.

Facts First: Trump wrongly described how the Paris accord works. The accord does give China more time than the US before it kicks in; it came into effect for all participating countries : Trump wrongly described how the Paris accord works. The accord does give China more time than the US before it kicks in; it came into effect for all participating countries in November 2016 . The accord simply allows each nation to set its own targets for reducing carbon emissions. China picked 2030 as the year by which it planned to meet its primary targets, while the US picked 2025.
While he had once entertained the idea, Trump decided against it because he did not want to anger Senate Republicans who will soon determine whether he's convicted during his Senate trial. Multiple GOP lawmakers had sent messages through aides that they felt strongly about not granting clemency to Assange or Snowden.

It's all part of a twisting of American history that's become plentiful the further we get from the original civil rights era. King won the argument over America's soul, and his commitment to nonviolence seems safe in the rearview mirror. So we gloss over the fact that he was a target of active measures by the FBI and CIA (former FBI director James Comey kept a copy of the letter authorizing surveillance of King in his office to remind him that with great power comes great responsibility).
The result has been a massive buildup of federal government debt, which was also stoked by the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. The federal debt owed to the public was 25% of GDP when Reagan took office. It was around 98% of GDP at the end of 2020, and will likely soar further because of further urgent spending related to Covid-19.
Having that kind of posture is the way I think we effectively debate the Republicans on this issue. Because if we just play into the same fear-mongering that they have been engaged in since 9/11, then we are playing on their battlefield, but, more importantly, we are not doing what's right in order to rebuild our alliances, repair our relationships around the world, and actually make us more safe in the long term.

There are stories like this all across America. And after two years of recession, the economy is growing again. Retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value. Businesses are beginning to invest again, and slowly, some are starting to hire again.
While these measures are pretty substantial, we do not think the ECB will be able to change investor sentiment any more than the Fed could last week, said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics.

We hope and believe we have elected the next president of the United States, Bush campaign chairman Don Evans said about 4:30 a.m. EST. The latest count in the state of Florida shows Gov. Bush winning that state by more than 1,200 votes. They're still counting. They're still counting, and I'm confident when all is said and done, we will prevail. Gore was projected to have 249 electoral votes, with at least two states -- Oregon and Wisconsin -- remaining too close to call this morning. CNN's count of the race showed Bush had received 2,905,033 votes in Florida; Gore had 2,904,107. I would caution both candidates not to make any definitive statements, Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth said in a statement issued early today. CNN's Jeff Greenfield reported that Butterworth, a Democrat who served as Gore's campaign chairman in Florida, called Gore and told him to put off a concession speech until a recount could be performed. Butterworth promised the recount would be done in a relatively short period of time, but said county election supervisors should give their poll workers a chance to rest first. We owe this to the people of this country, because we're talkng about one vote for every five or six precincts in this state, he said. With thousands of Gore supporters standing in the predawn rain in Nashville, Tennessee, campaign chairman William Daley announced Gore would not yet concede the race.

New rules from the Trump administration that would have weakened Obamacare's contraceptive mandate have been blocked by a federal judge. Judge Haywood Gilliam, Jr. stopped the new rules, set to go into effect today, which would have allowed more employers to get exemptions to the Affordable Care Act's mandate requiring them to provide insurance coverage for contraceptives with no co-pay. The judge's injunction only covers the 13 Democratic states (plus the District of Columbia) that brought the lawsuit, so the rules will still go into effect in the remainder of the states that aren't part of the legal case.
Since peaking at 1.8 million residents in the 1950s, Detroit's population has fallen to an estimated 680,000 as of 2014. The population losses began as the city's fabled auto industry started moving to the suburbs and tens of thousands of residents followed.

The Quinnipiac poll at which he was at 93% had an overall margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, and a larger margin of error for the smaller sub-sample of Republican voters, so that poll found that it's possible Trump's true number is indeed 95% -- but it's not accurate to make leaps from the numbers the polls actually found without explaining that this is what you are doing.
Growth has been slowing, however, while weak wages and the rising cost of living are squeezing real incomes.
He is also facing a civil investigation from the New York attorney general's office, which is looking at whether the President improperly inflated the value of his assets to obtain loans or favorable tax benefits. And, then, there are defamation lawsuits sparked by Trump denying accusations made by women who have alleged he assaulted them, including E. Jean Carroll, the former magazine columnist who has accused him of rape and Summer Zervos , who claims the President sexually assaulted her in 2007. Those cases have been delayed in the courts largely because of Trump's position -- that will no longer be the case next week.

I will teach you to ride your first bike, build your first sand box, watch you play sports and see you have kids also. I love you son, take care of your mother. I am always with you. Dad. On Easter Sunday of 2008, Chris was out on patrol in Baghdad when his Bradley Fighting Vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb. That night, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal glory in Arlington, and his wife Kelli is in the gallery tonight, joined by their son, who is now 13 years old. To Kelli and Gage: Chris will live in our hearts forever.

Trump's last-gasp swirl of petulant threats against lawmakers from his own party are playing out against the backdrop of a pair of tight Senate contests in Georgia, where Republicans could lose their Senate majority if Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler are swept by Democrats Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock, respectively, on Tuesday. The Republican incumbents, who both voted for the defense bill initially, were absent from Friday's vote -- Perdue in quarantine after being exposed to Covid-19 and Loeffler sticking to the campaign trail.
Some people will never trust politicians, so be sure to reach them with credible experts like public health professionals out front.

In order to benefit from the mortgage interest deduction, homeowners must itemize deductions and not take the standard deduction. President Bush's Tax Reform Commission documented that only 54 percent of those with mortgages benefit from the mortgage interest deduction. That means 46 percent of homeowners have paid for the benefit of the mortgage interest deduction when they bought their house but do not receive any tax benefits.
Better than savings accounts are CDs, or certificates of deposit, which are insured, timed deposits offered by banks and credit unions that have very low risk, but offer slightly better returns than savings accounts.

Jeff Zelevansky/Reuters Barack Obama The Wall Street meltdown continued during the first few months of President Barack Obama's presidency. The financial and auto industries teetered on the brink of collapse before government bailouts saved them both. Unemployment would peak at 10% in 2009, doubling in barely a year. The stock market bottomed out in March 2009, but then the economy slowly healed, beginning what would eventually become the longest bull market in American history. Digging out of the depths of the Great Recession was a long and slow process, though. Annual GDP growth never topped 3% in the Obama era. Hoping to juice the economy, the Fed kept pumping easy money into the system. The unprecedented experiment helped send stocks soaring — the S&P 500 nearly tripled during the Obama era — but also contributed to wealth inequality and populism. 1st term +85% Jan. 20, 2009 – Jan. 20, 2013 2nd term +53% Jan. 20, 2013 – Jan. 20, 2017
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- -- It's OK for Republicans to want President Obama to fail if they think he's jeopardizing the country, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal told members of his political party Tuesday night.
Because the fact is that, short of winning the lottery, coming into an inheritance or being on the receiving end of some other windfall, the combination of ratcheting up your savings rate and remaining on the job is your best shot at achieving a relatively secure and comfortable retirement. And even if you do those two things (as well as the others I'll suggest) you'll still probably have to scale back your standard of living somewhat.

Now McGahn has left the West Wing, as has chief of staff John Kelly, who presided during much of the time Trump railed against Mueller. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from overseeing the investigation, left the Justice Department in the hands of now-acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who disregarded the advice of a Justice Department ethics official and did not recuse from the probe. The next boss in line to oversee Mueller is Bill Barr, who was attorney general during the George H.W. Bush administration and is again nominated to be attorney general.

While Democrats take a legislative approach, they are fully aware that it isn't likely to be signed into law. The House Ways and Means Committee is also pursuing another route to obtain Trump's tax returns. Democrats believe under an obscure IRS rule, the incoming chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, has the power to obtain the returns from the Treasury Department. Neal has said he plans to ask for them in the new Congress, but when exactly he'd make his move is still under discussion.

As President Joe Biden begins his tenure, with narrow majorities in both the US House of Representatives and the US Senate, he will need to work with lawmakers in both parties to advance his legislative agenda. Even though Democrats now control both chambers, most legislation will still need to clear a 60-vote threshold to assure final passage in the Senate, and bipartisan support for his initiatives will therefore be crucial to ensure their passage.
Trump can accurately boast about the elimination of 100% of ISIS' self-proclaimed caliphate in Syria, but it's not true that 100% of ISIS itself has been eliminated; the terrorist group existed before it seized territory and continues to exist after it lost that territory. ISIS is still a threat in the wars in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan; ISIS affiliates continue to claim responsibility for attacks elsewhere; and the US government continues to warn about ISIS' ability to inspire homegrown terrorists around the world.

The deficit growth predicted by the Congressional Budget Office is due in part to tax cuts and a two-year budget deal that has boosted federal spending under Trump. It's swelled to $984 billion at the end of the last fiscal year, up from $665 billion during his first year in office in 2017. Usually, big budget deficits widen during economic downturns -- but the US economy is expanding and unemployment is at a 50-year low.

You know, I think you can tell from the first 45 minutes, you know, Senator Obama and I have a lot in common. We both care passionately about our country. We are devoted to public service. We care deeply about the future, and we have run a very vigorous and contested primary campaign, which has been by most standards, I think, very positive and extremely civil.
We don't see another surge in commercial real estate that would encourage a lot of borrowing, Cannon said. We see concerns about leveraged lending, which is an area that has grown rapidly. Businesses already have high debt loads, he added.

And I found that we had a lot in common, a lot of shared values, a belief that hard work is important, that self-reliance and individual responsibility count for a lot.
But Ryan and House GOP leaders have a road map for their repeal and replace process: they did much of it in 2016. While that effort was rejected, whether it was through reconciliation – the budget mechanism that will allow Republicans to repeal large swaths of the law – or through piecemeal bills that address the remaining chunks of the law, there is a step-by-step legislative process on which they've already delivered results. All of which were either vetoed or died in the Senate.
You want to look at it at least once a year, if not quarterly, said James Nichols, Senior Vice President at Voya.

First, the new administration should organize a diverse group of scholars who will be charged with offering a comprehensive and holistic portrait of America's racial history. The Pulitzer Prize-winning 1619 Project by Nikole Hannah-Jones offers an important template in this regard, but one that -- even as it has been debated among historians -- has also been attacked on ideological grounds by conservatives and neo-Confederates for being overly critical of the nation's long political and cultural embrace of White supremacy.

Blagojevich sought to build alliances with then-Democratic Illinois Senate President Emil Jones to try to advance his agenda, though it was widely viewed as damaging to the state's economy and unaffordable. Blagojevich would tell Jones that no one viewed him as a power or respected him as Senate president because Madigan was widely regarded as the power in Illinois. This created tensions between Madigan and Jones, and Madigan ultimately used the House to kill off most of Blagojevich's ill-conceived initiatives. Those feelings were beneath the obvious issues that included trying to shake down a children's hospital and sell a US Senate seat that led to Blagojevich's eventual impeachment, removal from office and federal conviction.

In theory, the special counsel will answer a cascade of questions raised in the investigation, including whether he believes Trump obstructed justice, and will release findings on the allegations of coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Mueller will likely assess whether Trump knew in advance about the Trump Tower meeting with Russians in June 2016, whether campaign contacts sought stolen Democratic Party emails, whether foreign money illegally came into the election and what gave rise to the Republican Party changing its platform on Russian intervention in Ukraine.

The money may also not be paid back to your 401(k) (unlike in the 401(k) loan example above), and you will be barred from contributing to the 401(k) plan for six months. Your 401(k) balance will permanently shrink, and you'll be barred from doing anything to grow it for six months.

(CNN) Polls show more and more Americans are saying they will get the Covid-19 vaccine when it's their turn. That's good news.

The Obamacare exchanges, however, have proven surprisingly resilient. Some 8.4 million people signed up on the federal exchange for 2019. Still, that's down from roughly 9.2 million who picked plans for 2017. Much of the drop stems from fewer new consumers selecting policies.
When he had to govern, he was actually kind of a great compromiser. He was willing to make compromises to get things done. You almost never hear about the fact he reached a deal with Democrats on Social Security, Bunch said.

Forbes burst on the political scene with his radical, 17 percent flat-tax proposal in 1996, and a series of negative ads that wounded the eventual Republican nominee, former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole. But Forbes failed to expand his base or organize in key states, and his candidacy failed. With the end of the 1996 presidential election cycle, Forbes opted to begin his 2000 effort with a few new twists, long before Republican establishment favorite Bush and the dark horse McCain tipped their hands and made their intentions to run known. The publishing heir -- chided from all sides for his background of privilege during the 1996 race -- first moved to retool his campaign operation by building his organization from local offices on up to provide a more grass roots feel. As the 2000 campaign heated up, Forbes chose to look past trends showing that many Republican voters were adopting a moderate lean, and while promoting his flat tax plan, he sharpened his social agenda to include calls against legalized abortion, as well as a series of so-called pro-family, morally based pronouncements. But the conservative voting bloc Forbes hoped to appeal to was split by a crowded field of right-leaning candidates that included Keyes, Gary Bauer and Sen. Orrin Hatch. The latter two men have left the race. The messenger may have gotten tripped up, but if the message is good, he can't regret doing it, he said Thursday.

The well-heeled publishing heir, who poured an estimated $66 million of his personal fortune into the 1996 and 2000 presidential races, decided to toss in the towel on his 2000 bid after a disastrous third-place showing in Tuesday's Delaware GOP primary. His departure from the race essentially narrows the Republican field of hopefuls to two -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who won Delaware with 51 percent of the vote, and Arizona Sen. John McCain. Talk show host Alan Keyes still stands as a candidate, but his ability to make a dent in the support accorded to Bush and McCain seems questionable at best. Standing by an earlier guarantee, Forbes refused to endorse any of the three Republicans left in the race for the 2000 nomination, though he threw each measured compliments throughout his news conference. John McCain, Gov. Bush and Alan Keyes are good people, he said. I've gotten to know them. ... But endorsements have become a debased currency in the presidential arena. What I need to do now is wind down my campaign. An endorsement, if I make one, may come in a few weeks. Forbes credited his 2000 campaign, which in effect was launched with the end of his 1996 candidacy, with elevating the dialogue among the full Republican field -- which stood at 10 some months ago, before being whittled down to three by Thursday. Our new conservative agenda will come to pass, mark my words, he said.

Fact First: This Sanders' claim needs a lot of context. Biden did repeatedly support freezes in Social Security spending and at times called for raising the retirement age.

Overall, the claim leaves out that Biden was typically talking about any changes to entitlements in the context of a broader legislative package.

When Trump's 1995 tax return surfaced late in the presidential campaign, it showed up in the mailbox of a Times reporter. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was forced to resign after the Post broke news that the acting attorney general had warned he was vulnerable to Russian blackmail.
When lawmakers and pundits say what we all witnessed Wednesday isn't who we are as a country, they are wrong. It may not be who anyone wants the US to be, but Trump's brand of violent, racist politics is now part of the American political landscape. It will take work to weed it out.

After the hour-long meeting in the Capitol, where the conversation included proposals of payroll tax holidays for workers, targeted relief for hard-hit industries -- like airlines, cruise ships, restaurants and retail -- tax cuts to help small businesses better afford sick leave for their workers and other proposals, some GOP senators remained skeptical about quickly passing an expensive stimulus package.
In the meeting, Mnuchin told GOP senators he would present more details during a Tuesday lunch about the Trump administration's proposal for the next economic package. He also told senators to get behind the House-passed measure, which would ensure individuals have access to free testing for the disease and displaced workers have access to paid leave, bolster unemployment insurance benefits, expand food stamps and increase federal funding for Medicaid programs.

A series of national polls conducted and released over the past week leave no doubt that a majority of the public blames Trump and Republicans for the ongoing shutdown. In a CNN poll out over the weekend, 55% blamed Trump for the shutdown while 32% said it was congressional Democrats at fault. (A majority – 56% – opposed the construction of a wall along the entirety of the southern US border with Mexico.) In a Washington Post-ABC News poll from this weekend, the results were very similar; 53% said the shutdown blame falls primarily on Trump and Republicans while 29% blamed Democrats in Congress. There's plenty more recent polling that gets at that same idea: People blame Trump and Republicans for this shutdown and believe the cause of the shutdown – a border wall – won't solve the problems posed by immigration.

But I also know this problem is not going away. By the time I'm finished speaking tonight, more Americans will have lost their health insurance. Millions will lose it this year. Our deficit will grow. Premiums will go up. Patients will be denied the care they need. Small-business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether.
Another indirect advantage for the winning city: Rising home values will likely to lead to higher property taxes, which could help boost a city's budget and services.

[10:27:24] SAVIDGE: We are continuing to follow breaking news out of Paris. Thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest rising fuel costs. Police have now fired tear gas, water cannons have been brought to bear as well to try to disperse the crowd. This has grown in the level of violence that we have been witnessing, not only the response from authorities but there are fires that are now being set on the streets of Paris. There are the sounds of explosions, a combination of flash bangs that are being used by authorities as well as fireworks that are being used by the protesters.

Setting aside a reasonable chunk of your income on a regular basis can reap huge rewards for you. First, buying investments that have decades to grow will get you an enormous return thanks to compound interest. Second, having a savings account with a few months' worth of expenses can spare you from having to rely on credit cards during emergencies, which means you'll save a fortune on interest and other debt-related charges. And third, having money saved up gives you more flexibility in your lifestyle choices. For example, if you want to pursue a career in a field that has great earning potential in the future but pays very little today, having some cushion in the bank will make it a lot safer and easier to go for the dream job.
Those who can, do. A Bangalore-based mining baron, for example, reportedly spent around $75 million on Brazilian samba dancers and bouncers (among other things) for his daughter's wedding in November.

Take a deep breath anyway, Williams added. Bernie Sanders has as good a shot as any of the other candidates at beating Trump -- maybe even a better one.
White House Office of Management and Budget acting director Russell Vought acknowledged that Congress has a history of ignoring the President's spending proposals.
Instead of focusing on pushing his stimulus plans through Congress, as investors had hoped, Trump is instead acting first on polarizing issues like the ban on travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations. The White House has also taken an aggressive stance on trade, raising concerns on Wall Street over the risk of a trade war.

If you have a high-deductible health insurance plan, then you may qualify to open an HSA, and any contributions you make are deductible. For that matter, distributions from the HSA (when used to pay for medical expenses) are also tax-free. HSAs are definitely a taxpayer's friend. For 2017, the annual contribution limit for HSAs is $3,400 if you're on an individual health insurance plan or $6,750 if you're on a family plan.

In general, when you contribute to a traditional IRA, you do so on a pre-tax basis. Your money then has the advantage of being able to grow tax-deferred. But it's important to remember that when you withdraw that money -- consisting of both principal and earnings -- you will owe ordinary income taxes on your distributions. And when you are in retirement and no longer bringing in income, you will be responsible for paying those taxes either from your retirement accounts or from other sources of funds.

Like any trade war, everyone loses with Trump's proposed tariff wall. US consumers lose by paying more for Mexican products.

If you want life insurance that lasts your entire life and also builds cash value, you can expect to pay a lot more for coverage than you would for a more restrictive policy.

Thornton can't understand why the BOER would claim he didn't live in the county, or why the board would try to remove him from the rolls. His catfish farm is in unincorporated Mayfield, 20 minutes outside Sparta, and he wasn't eligible to vote in the city elections.

I just think for most people that has been litigated. That was a big issue over the course of his campaign and people voted for him, Thune said.

And, you know, at some point this gets really hard to take, because if you are someone like I am, who has withstood the full force of corporate lobbyists, starting with the health insurance companies, and the drug companies, and the oil companies, and everybody that I've taken on for all of these years, you know, I think I'm independent and tough enough to be able to deal with anybody.

No matter how they arrived at their refusenik stance, if this group is large enough, it may prevent herd immunity, which experts estimate would require immunity from 70-85% of the population to achieve. That would precipitate discussions of mandatory vaccination, which, in turn, would inflame those already determined to avoid vaccination, threatening the entire national campaign and exacerbating a giant national argument about the role of government in daily health and safety.

Kelton: Neither. MMT is mostly a descriptive project. It provides a lens that can be used to understand how a modern, capitalist economy works.

Biden, who was a US senator at the time of his vote, responded, I learned that I can't take the word of a President when in fact they assured me that they would not use force. Remember the context.

McConnell is a wily, unflappable, and determined Senate leader, and Democrats who underestimate him do so at their constant political peril, which is why the nervous muttering inside the Senate GOP about the economic damage this ongoing shutdown is causing the nation – to say nothing of the political cost it is causing the GOP – is so notable. For once, the complaints and concerns aren't from the Democrats whom McConnell spanks on a regular basis. The worry is coming from the Senate GOP, especially from some of the 22 Republican Senators up for reelection in 2020.

(CNN) President Donald J. Trump is an immoral force in the most powerful office in the world, and he must be stopped. Since falsely equating peaceful protesters and White supremacists in the aftermath of Charlottesville in his first year in office, Trump has repeatedly demonstrated that he is incapable of making morally sound choices. Worse, he intentionally makes debased ones that harm people, governmental institutions and sacred traditions in order to enrich himself. Consequently, Congress, the criminal justice system and the general public must hold Trump accountable.

Plus, your contributions to traditional retirement accounts are tax-deductible, so you can turn around and use the money you save on taxes to increase your net worth further. Decreasing your debt is a worthwhile goal for a lot of reasons, especially if you have a lot of expensive credit card debt or other high interest debt.

However, this doesn't give you carte blanche to throw whatever numbers you like into your tax return.

So while it's natural to be happy that you are extremely unlikely to be audited, don't push your luck. Claiming legitimate deductions that you might otherwise be too nervous to take is one thing; committing tax fraud is entirely different.

When asked by CNN about Lee's comments, the APA referred them to this guidance.

As the federal debt has grown -- and many states have struggled -- one part of American society has laughed all the way to the bank. The wealthy funders of both parties -- Wall Street financiers, big oilmen, Silicon Valley gurus, real estate developers, private-prison owners, etc. -- couldn't believe their good fortunes in receiving repeated tax breaks and even the deregulation of their polluting activities. The rich got richer year after year, while working class Whites and African Americans, social conservatives and social liberals, evangelicals and atheists, waged the pitched battle for the nation's soul.
In an interview published by Time magazine in early December, Zelensky did say, Look, I never talked to the President from the position of a quid pro quo. That's not my thing.

That process requires only a simple majority of voters rather than the 60 most laws need to break a potential filibuster. The aides added that the campaign has not discussed the plan with any other declared or potential presidential hopefuls.

Bush, Gore kick off fall campaign season with appeal to working families Candidates trade jabs over debate schedule NAPERVILLE, Illinois (CNN) -- The major presidential candidates kicked off the fall campaign season Monday with appeals to working Americans as they again accused each other of ducking presidential debates. Democratic nominee Al Gore marked Labor Day with unionized workers during a round-the-clock campaign blitz and Republican rival George W. Bush touted his tax-cut plan while stumping through Midwestern states Monday. As we come down to the stretch, we're ready for the contest. We feel great about our chances, Bush said during a rally Monday in Naperville, Illinois. Bush and his running mate, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, arrived in the GOP-friendly Chicago suburb early Monday to take part in the town's Labor Day parade. The duo then parted ways, with Bush heading to Romeo, Michigan, for the state's annual peach festival and Cheney attending a Polish food fair in Chicago. Deadlocked in the polls with Gore, Bush plans to visit nine cities this week in Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Indiana and Ohio -- states that represent 107 electoral votes, and which polls indicate are up for grabs. His stump speeches have reflected a growing sense of urgency in recent weeks, and have been increasingly peppered with attacks on his Democratic rival's ties to ethical problems that have plagued the Clinton administration.

Trump's decision to weigh in – telling The Washington Post over the weekend that not only was he nearly done with his own Affordable Care Act replacement plan, but that it would provide insurance for everybody – at once riled Capitol Hill Republicans already in a sensitive position on the issue and underscored the fraught and unknown nature of a nascent relationship with Capitol Hill.

He also does not mention the Obama-led Asia trade deal he removed the US from when he took office. That deal — with other Pacific countries — has gone forward without the US.

For its part, the Trump administration refused to comply with all Democratic requests for documents and witnesses associated with impeachment.

What seems increasingly evident, however, is that tax reform will not be completed this summer as originally promised and possibly not even this year. True tax reform is always harder than it seems.

The first step would be to pass a budget bill through committee to essentially unlock the process. Once that was finished, the Senate Democrats could rework Biden's bill so it fit into a very specific framework of what is allowed under the process. Reconciliation requires that anything passed has a real impact on the budget and not just an incidental one. The process also requires that proposals have no impact on social security and that the impacts on the budget do not stretch beyond a 10-year window if the changes are permanent. Because the process requires jumping through so many hoops and consultation with the Senate's parliamentarian, committee staff have been working for weeks now to make sure they understand and are ready for the process in case it has to be used.
Over the past week, prison officials have also begun to release certain vulnerable inmates early, and handing out face coverings to every inmate and correctional officer that remained.

For many people aspiring to retire early, getting and maintaining health insurance can be a major stumbling block. The reason: You're not eligible for Medicare until you hit 65. So if you retire before that date and don't have coverage through a former employer (or, if you're married, through a spouse's current or former employer), you'll have to buy health care coverage on your own. That can be a budget wrecker, which is why it's imperative you have a good idea of what the tab for health insurance will be before you actually leave your job.

The lighting slump isn't special to GE, which has also been grappling with troubles in its insurance, power and transportation businesses. It's an industrywide problem driven by low prices and the popularity of LED lights that last for decades, limiting the need to replace them.
Boat Quay does, however, have one hidden gem: the Neko no Niwa Cat Café, situated on the second floor of a shophouse. More cat cafes have since opened, but Neko no Niwa is the country's very first. It's also my favorite, because the owners, Sam and Sue, are uncompromising about the welfare of their feline companions. (A note for parents: Children under the age of 7 aren't allowed in the cafe; children between 7 and 14 need adult supervision.)
We can't afford another so-called economic expansion like the one from last decade, what some call the lost decade, where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion, where the income of the average American household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs, where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation.

As more households transition from just consuming energy to also producing energy with solar panels and other renewable technologies, we will need to build a modern, decentralized electric grid to accommodate them. Rural Americans today need access to broadband Internet the way they once needed electricity. As Americans, especially millennials, look for new transportation options without the stress and cost of driving, we need to provide them with new choices, such as convenient public transportation. And since whatever we construct today will be expected to last for a long time, our investments must make sense in an era of climate change.

Some presidents leave looking like they can't wait to hand over the burdens of office. But others loathe ceding the spotlight. President Richard Nixon, who also left in disgrace, delivered a tearful farewell to his Cabinet with the immortal self-justifying line, Others may hate you, but those who hate you don't win unless you hate them, and then you destroy yourself.

All we're getting really is the irrelevant distraction of the president calling people traitors and spies and them complaining about how unfair the process is, and all of these extraneous immaterial arguments. They really don't have any answer to the fact that what the president did is to unleash his operatives to go and to shake down the Ukrainian government in order to get political dirt on American citizens who are, you know, his political rivals and then cover the entire thing up.
Fidelity Investments reports that about 40% of families are now saving for college via a 529 plan, which represents an increase from previous years. And while 529s are by no means the only option for saving for college, they're a far more efficient route than savings and traditional brokerage accounts.

The primary effect is that the new administration will be occupied for its first couple of years with reversing all the damage rather than continuing to make progress, said Ted Lamm, a senior research fellow at the Center for Law, Energy and the Environment at the University of California-Berkeley.

They never received documents from the Trump administration related to Ukraine, some of which have been released in the weeks since the President was impeached in December thanks to Freedom of Information Act lawsuits. There's also the question of Bolton, who indicated he was willing to testify in the Senate but has not said the same about the House.
Another high-profile handout is Foxconn, the huge Taiwanese manufacturer, which picked up more than $4 billion from Wisconsin taxpayers, courtesy of Wisconsin politicians, to build a plant in the southeastern corner of the state.

Failing to do this would send a message that inciting people to take to the streets of Washington, DC for a wild protest that led to them breaking into the Capitol, threatening the lives of those inside and disrupting one of the most important functions of government -- ensuring that the winners of elections are able to take office -- is somehow not that big of a problem.
President Trump promised last week that he would present his new tax reform plan on Wednesday.
The stock market is certainly not the best indicator of the economy's health, or of a president's track record. But throughout his four years in office, it clearly was President Donald Trump's favorite metric. He often tweeted in all caps about ALL TIME HIGHS!!! for stocks, even as the country grappled with surging coronavirus cases and high unemployment during the pandemic. Now, as he wraps up his last day in the White House, where does Trump's beloved stock market stand? As of Tuesday's market close, the S&P 500 was up 67% since his Inauguration Day in 2017. Here's how that performance stacks up to stocks at the same point in other modern presidencies (1,006 trading days, to be exact): Stocks were up 83% at this point in Barack Obama's presidency, amid the recovery from the Great Recession. They were much weaker under George W. Bush, down about 13% because of the September 11th attacks and the dot-com bust. Stocks were up 75% four years into Bill Clinton's presidency, and 25% into Ronald Reagan's. Meanwhile, President George H.W. Bush, who also failed to win reelection, ended his four years with stocks up around 50%. Unlike his predecessor, incoming President-elect Joe Biden does not put nearly as much emphasis on stocks as a gauge of the country's strength or wellbeing. The idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what's happening, Biden said of Trump in the final presidential debate in October.

The Biden team is also having conversations with key committees and leadership about his first legislative priority, ensuring they can pass another stimulus bill. CNN has been told by one source familiar with those talks that Biden is eying legislation that will include $2,000 checks, an extension of federal unemployment benefits, more money for vaccine distribution as well as state and local funding that was dropped from the last package. The plan, according to the source, is for Democrats to try and introduce the bill without using reconciliation first. If Republicans object, aides tell CNN, they could use the arcane reconciliation process to try and pass the stimulus with a simple majority vote. While there is still likely to be plenty of time between now and then, Biden's team isn't letting impeachment stop them from beginning their legislative work.

The impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful southern border wall he pledged to build on the Mexican border has been reduced, on White House stationery, to a physical wall on the southern border.

Coverage of the Democrats' Iowa caucuses dominated televisions Tuesday morning, potentially increasing the odds that Trump will use his high-profile speech to swipe at potential rivals.
The American education system is a puzzle that generations of politicians have not been able to solve. States actually control public schools — or government schools, as Trump derisively calls them. It will be interesting to see how this issue of school choice — which used to mean vouchers for religious education or home schooling but today usually means charter schools — progresses in the Democratic primary. Someone like Mike Bloomberg might not be that far off from Trump on choice. Other candidates want to insure every kid is guaranteed a good education in every public school. There are no easy answers.

It's been a long time coming.
That's particularly unusual in such a strong economy without major new expenditures. If no changes are made, the CBO projects that public debt will rise to 96% of GDP by 2028. A big chunk of that – $1.9 trillion between 2018 and 2028 – will be due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the CBO reported last April.

From -- from the first railroads to the Interstate Highway System, our nation has always been built to compete. There's no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains or the new factories that manufacture clean-energy products.

I don't think the House bill is going to pass the Senate as it is written for one basic problem: It doesn't go far enough and it doesn't go fast enough, GOP Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said on the floor of the Senate, referring to the bill's system for small businesses to get tax credits for paid leave for their displaced employees.

From the moment he descended the Trump Tower escalator in June 2015 and entered national politics with a barrage of incendiary, racist tripe , Trump has routinely and scurrilously lied and sold his self-serving version of events and conspiracy theories. He has willfully and cynically divided and inflamed the country he was elected to lead to suit his own ends.
Don't panic, but it's time. Taxes are due on April 17th, 2018.

As Cuomo was wrapping up in New York, Trump and his team were beginning their own briefing at the White House. But where Cuomo projected competence and authority, with a dash of his idiosyncratic humor, Trump was meandering. When prodded to offer some kind of empathy -- Trump lashed out.
Despite the unexpected move to impeach Trump for the second time, four confirmation hearings are already scheduled for Tuesday, a sign that Republicans and Democrats are finding some consensus to move forward despite the inflamed political environment right now. Reminder, these committees are still chaired by Republicans until Wednesday, meaning Republicans had to notice these hearings. Four Senate Committees -- Foreign Relations, Armed Services, Finance and Homeland Security -- have announced they will hold confirmation hearings for Secretary of State nominee Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary nominee Lloyd Austin, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.
Worth noting: Despite the CIA concluding that Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman was personally involved in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Trump has said no one can know the truth – and even if we did know the truth it wouldn't be worth risking our financial relationship with Saudi Arabia. So, there's that.

He's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1.6 million jobs lost.

What's more, those calculations assume that your contributions won't increase over that 14-year time period. If you punch these numbers into a savings calculator and add just a 3% annual increase in contributions, you'll see that you'd hit a retirement savings of $199,277 after 13 years, not 14. Suddenly that target net worth doesn't sound so impossible, does it?

I also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China's massive theft of American jobs. Our strategy worked. Days ago, we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions of dollars into our treasury, and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the United States of America. For decades, China has taken advantage of the United States, now we have changed that but, at the same time, we have perhaps the best relationship we have ever had with China, including with President Xi. They respect what we have done because, quite frankly, they could never believe what they were able to get away with year after year, decade after decade, without someone in our country stepping up and saying: Enough. Now, we want to rebuild our country, and that is what we are doing.

But Madigan has also lasted because of his ability to change. At one time, citing his Roman Catholic faith, Madigan was opposed to abortion and his ideology could be viewed almost as a Blue Dog centrist-to-conservative Democrat. But with his ability to adapt, Madigan eventually oversaw progressive legislation making Illinois a leader in abortion rights, one of the first states to enact same-sex marriage before the US Supreme Court ruled and the 11th state to legalize recreational adult use of marijuana.

That's the most attractive tax rate -- zero, he said, but noted he was closely watching for any developments on tax reform in the United States.
Kelton: I believe the government should use the federal budgeting process to maintain a balanced economy. That means balancing the risks of inflation against the benefits of full employment. It means embarking on new spending programs only if those programs can be implemented without causing excessive inflation. It might be necessary to raise taxes in order to prevent, say, a massive infrastructure program from pushing the economy beyond its limit. But taxes aren't the only way to curb inflation. The most important thing is to understand what's actually driving the inflation. Historically, the big drivers of inflation have been: energy, housing, and health care. So even if the political reality means you can't raise taxes, you can still fight inflation with policies that increase the supply of available housing units, promote energy efficiency, and lower health care costs. I also wouldn't discount the possibility that our political realities might evolve rather quickly with an MMT-informed Congress.
Because the lawsuit was brought by Texas and other GOP-led states, rather than the Trump administration itself, the Biden Justice Department can change its stance but that wouldn't result in the case becoming moot.
Now, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic. I was an altar boy. I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me.

NATO also has its own direct budget to fund its operations. While the US was also the biggest contributor to this budget in 2016, covering about 22%, it was, clearly, not alone ; Germany covered about 15%, France about 11%, the United Kingdom about 10%, and so on. Countries' contributions were set based on their national income.
He said the lack of coordination between the White House and Congress doesn't bode well for gigantic legislative deals on Obamacare, infrastructure and tax reform.
What do they spend their money on?
Republicans have become like compulsive gamblers, pulling the Trump lever over and over again at the worst political slot machine in history. The increasingly rare occasions they get an outcome they like – a judge here and a regulatory fix there – are offset by the unappealing combination of malice and ineptitude of a White House willing to burn the economy to the ground to satisfy this President's ego.

Trump must be held accountable for crimes against the state. We all have some power to help with holding him accountable and should not hesitate to use it going forward. Trump screwed up the most important job in the world -- president of the United States. Let's make sure he doesn't benefit now from the best job in the world -- former president of the United States. And for those who say this is cancel culture run amok, I say it's perfectly legal citizen justice well earned by Donald J Trump.
As some anticipate the holiday that others dread, the spotlight is split between two groups: Those in relationships, and those who're not. While there are certainly perks to both lifestyles, when is it better to be coupled up, and when is it better to be living the single life?
(CNN) President Donald Trump will exit the White House on Wednesday but leave behind three of the nine Supreme Court justices and a majority that was willing to partner with him for much of his agenda.

So what other complaints do teachers have?
The states are not able to step in by providing more local services and infrastructure neglected by the federal government. States compete with each other by slashing taxes to attract investments away from other states. Only the federal government has the power to raise adequate tax revenues to meet the public's needs for healthcare, education, job training, research and development, infrastructure and other needs.

Chatwood, 28, isn't much of a workhorse, as he's never pitched more than 158 innings in a season. But it does catch one's eye that he put up a 3.18 ERA away from Coors Field during his time with the Colorado Rockies. He also has a talent for inducing ground balls (54.7 GB%) that will play well with the Cubs' infield. Thus, he should do better than the 4.59 ERA that the Cubs got from Lackey in 2017.
So-called sanctuary cities are a frequent target of Trump's. His record against them in court has been mixed.

Research shows that retirees who have a wide circle of friends tend to be happier in retirement. So in the years leading up your planned exit date, you'll want to consider a variety of ways to remain socially connected, such as reconnecting with old friends, making an effort to stay in touch with colleagues from work and even cultivating a new network of friends and acquaintances, say, by volunteering at a local charity or enrolling in adult-education classes. Starting a new hobby or throwing yourself into a new project --writing a book, launching a blog, learning a new language or musical instrument, etc.-- can also help engender a sense of purpose during a lengthy retirement.

Thus, many freelancers are breathing a sigh of relief that they too will be included in the new stimulus package. As Espinal told me by phone, This is going to hopefully ensure that there's cash flow into the homes of freelancers, who, he stressed, are doubly affected by this crisis because we depend on many of the non-essential small businesses that have been shut down in order to do our work.
Trump announced in his first year in office that he intended to exit the Paris Climate Agreement. He said during the announcement, which was aimed at curbing climate change, that the accord placed draconian financial burdens on the American people. It's one of many instances of Trump exiting an international agreement where he felt the US was treated unfairly.

And this is only the beginning. Starting today, Democrats in the House will make Trump's life a living hell. Efforts are already underway to bring a number of his Cabinet officials before Congress, to extricate his tax returns from his grip and to more deeply probe his business dealings both before and during his presidency.
A: Part of the reason is that we misunderstand the Supreme Court. We think of it in terms of left vs. right – are they conservative or liberal. But what's united the justices over the course of American history is that they've generally been pro-business, whether they are liberal or conservative. I think that reflects our political process, the influence that corporations have in getting their presidents elected and presidents who support business.

California has a shiny, new net neutrality law, and the Trump administration is already working to knock it down. The law stops internet service providers from blocking or slowing specific types of content or applications, or charging apps or companies fees for faster access to customers. It's the strictest net neutrality protection in the country and could serve as a blueprint for other states. The Department of Justice says the law is illegal and is taking the state to court. Remember, the FCC repealed net neutrality regulations earlier this year.

Paul Moses: The renegade Catholic clerics who shamefully backed Trump's Big Lie
Bush also called for a new era of responsibility in Washington and promised to ease the partisan rancor that has characterized much of American politics in recent years, citing his ability to work with legislators on both sides of the aisle in Texas. And he included a call to restore honor to the White House in nearly every campaign appearance -- a not-so-subtle reference to Clinton's affair with a former White House intern, which led to his 1998 impeachment and acquittal by the Senate the following year. Third parties seek to influence future races While Bush and Gore sprinted around the country hoping to secure the winning margin in the upper Midwest and along the East Coast, minor-party candidates Nader and Pat Buchanan vowed their movements would remain active into the next election cycle. Gore had to spend more time and money in some states that normally would be considered reliably Democratic because of Green Party candidate Nader's challenge from his left. Democrats worried a strong turnout for Nader -- he ended up with about 2.4 million votes, or 3 percent nationwide -- could take votes from Gore and throw the election to Bush. The Greens failed to get the 5 percent of the popular vote they need to qualify for federal matching funds in the 2004 presidential race, but Nader declared the night a win for the party anyway. We're coming out of this election with millions of votes -- with the third-largest political party in America, replacing the Reform Party, he said.
Members of Congress, we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people. The people are the heart of our country, their dreams are the soul of our country, and their love is what powers and sustains our country. We must always remember that our job is to put America first!

Paying off credit card debt with a 401(k) loan still isn't a good option, but if you're caught in a spiral of high-interest credit card debt that you'll struggle to pay off (perhaps a scenario in which you have twice the average household credit card debt), a 401(k) loan could give you the ability to do a needed reset if you aren't able to take advantage of other, better debt consolidation strategies. You would still have to pay all of the money back with after-tax dollars (meaning that you'd lose out on one of the key benefits to the 401(k) — its tax-deferred status), and if you exit your job, you may be forced to pay the entire balance back immediately. Taking out a loan on your 401(k) isn't an attractive strategy, but it may make sense if you're in a tough spot.
The almost non-existent bidding for oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge were not surprising. It confirms what we already know to be true: the era of drilling for oil at any cost is over, says Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, an environmental non-profit.

WikiLeaks played a key role also, as you heard right there, in the release of DNC and Clinton campaign e-mails in 2016. Back then, President Trump said, I love WikiLeaks. Now he says he knows nothing about WikiLeaks.
Well it says 'paid for by Sen. John McCain,' Bush said. You can disagree with me on issues, John, but do not question my trustworthiness and do not compare me with Bill Clinton. Keyes, who badly trails both candidates in the polls, spent much of the night saying that such squabbling was not what voters want. You say this is being transmitted to 200 countries and all I'm sitting here listening to is these two guys going on about their ads? he said. The problem, he said, stemmed from the fact that people are trying so hard to be all things to all people ... so they get into this spitting match over who did what to whom. When asked about tax cuts, both Bush and McCain defended their proposals. The difference between Gov. Bush's proposal and mine is I put a whole lot into shoring up Social Security and paying down the debt, and he puts a whole lot into tax cuts, McCain said. It's not the Washington mentality -- it's the grown-up mentality, McCain said of his $240 billion tax cut plan. The plan, he said, would pay off the debt and provide tax cuts to low- and moderate-income Americans while saving Social Security. If we have a debt, we ought to pay it off, McCain said, vowing to veto any bill that increases spending if elected president. I won't just be a hapless bystander.
Earnings estimates, a key indicator of stock prices, almost always decline each quarter as companies manage expectations lower (and then top those expectations anyway). Yet the opposite happened this time as analysts scrambled to assess the benefits of President Trump's corporate tax cuts.

Facts First: Trump did not publicly oppose the invasion of Iraq before it began. Trump was tentatively supportive of the war when radio host Howard Stern asked him in September 2002, Are you for invading Iraq? He responded: Yeah, I guess so.

As for your question of whether your tax rate should play a role in calculating the withdrawal rate, the answer is no. Here's why: Let's say you withdraw 4% of your nest egg's value, or $40,000.

And it's the change in your nest egg's value over time, not how much you end up with in spending cash after paying taxes on a withdrawal, that determines how long your savings will last.

It's time to elect people who say what they mean and mean what they say when they tell the American people something, Bush said Monday. It's time to get rid of all those words like 'no controlling legal authority.' Gore used the phrase to defend the practice of making telephone fund-raising calls from his White House office during the 1996 presidential campaign. The vice president charged the calls to a private credit card, and said there was no controlling legal authority that forbid raising political donations from government property. Bush focused on familiar stump themes such as education and military readiness during his Labor Day speech, and described his across-the-board tax-cut proposals as aimed at helping working-class families. The surplus doesn't exist because of the ingenuity and hard work of the federal government. The surplus exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American working people, Bush said, countering Gore claims that his 10-year, $1.3 trillion plan is too costly. He said that Gore's targeted tax cut proposals, aimed at helping low- and middle-class Americans through deductions for education, health care, and child care expenses, would likely by forgotten after the November election. If you remember in 1992, they said give us a chance, we will have targeted tax cuts for the middle class. And now they have to say it again, Bush said. Just prior to his speech, Bush was heard using an expletive to describe a New York Times reporter -- the author of several articles Bush campaign regarded as unfair.

GOP rivals point fingers in South Carolina debate Candidate face-off is last before Saturday primary COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN) -- The final debate before Saturday's South Carolina GOP primary was marked Tuesday by accusations of negative campaigning, and the three remaining rivals answered questions on such stalwart Republican issues as tax cuts, the death penalty, abortion and nuclear arms. The free-flowing format of the debate, which was moderated by CNN's Larry King, led to several lively repartees between Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Arizona Sen. John McCain and former Ambassador Alan Keyes, who, when they were not taking aim at one another, fired shots at President Bill Clinton. It's kind of politics, Bush said of the negative turn the South Carolina campaign has taken. Saying he had let the other candidates define him in the campaign's early days, Bush vowed: I'm not going to let it happen again. And unfortunately you ran an ad that equated me to Bill Clinton, he said to McCain. That's about as low a blow that you can give in a Republican primary. There was an ad run against me, we ran a counter ad in New Hampshire, McCain shot back. Then I was beat up pretty bad by his surrogates comparing me to Clinton, 'Clinton lite,'  McCain said, running through the campaign's negative twists and turns. This is an attack piece, Bush said as he held up a flyer he said was placed on a voter's windshield. That's not by my campaign, McCain insisted.
It's a fair hypothetical question for Mitchell to ask, but it's also fair to wonder if he's taking enough responsibility.

And yet, in the face of this avalanche of polling data – remember when Trump couldn't wait to tout the results of the latest poll in the 2016 GOP primary?? – Trump seems entirely unable or unwilling to bend. He's not going to budge even 1 inch, a source familiar with Trump's thinking told CNN's Jeremy Diamond on Monday. (That same source told Diamond that Trump keeps citing increased support for a border wall – 42% support for it in the WaPo-ABC poll – as evidence he is winning.

If you're still working, contributing to a Roth IRA is one of the best ways to lower your taxes in retirement. That's because Roth IRA withdrawals aren't subject to taxes, nor are you required to take them at any given point in time. Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, by contrast, impose required minimum distributions starting at age 70 1/2, and once you're forced to remove funds from a non-Roth account, you'll be subject to the taxes that go along with them.

The question of whether or not to impeach Trump is best understood as part of the need for a larger transitional justice process following the end of his administration.

Also on hand at the rally were civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and AFL-CIO leader John Sweeney. Sweeney lined up an early AFL-CIO endorsement of Gore during the presidential primary season despite differences with the vice president on global trade issues, most recently his support for permanent normalized trade relations with China.

In a tone-deaf move devoid of empathy for what Americans are going through, some GOP senators objected to the extra unemployment benefits that would be offered to eligible workers, $600 per week, feeling that it was too generous (as Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii tweeted) and might disincentivize people to go back to work once the crisis is over. This of course ignores the fact that the extra unemployment benefits only last for four months and wouldn't be indefinite. And, just before the House passed the stimulus bill Friday, a Republican representative, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, attempted to thwart its passage by requesting a full roll-call vote and forcing many members of the House to travel to Washington (despite the fact that this is ill-advised and risky during a pandemic) to block him.

Facts First: Biden's claim is misleading by omission. Biden was Biden's claim is misleading by omission. Biden was an advocate of ending the Saddam Hussein regime for more than a year before the war began in 2003. While Biden did begin calling his 2002 vote a mistake in 2005 , he was a public supporter of the war in 2003 and 2004 -- and he made clear in 2002 and 2003, both before and after the war started, that he had known he was voting to authorize a possible war, not only to try to get inspectors into Iraq. It's also unclear whether Bush ever made Biden any kind of promise related to the use of force.

Borrowing from your 401(k) is even less advisable. That's because you lose out on two of the biggest advantages to workplace retirement plans: tax-deferred compounding of your money and tax-deductible contributions. Sure, you pay yourself back with interest, but that interest is paid with after-tax dollars, and it will be harder for you to make new contributions while you're repaying your old loan.

WALSH: Well, it's a good question, Margaret. You know, where is the U.S. leverage here? And it's certainly not in something like trade sanctions, because we don't do a lot of trade with Iran, and we don't recognize them as a country. It's really the nonproliferation regime where we have the most leverage.

Many workers who don't have access to an employer-sponsored 401(k) opt to save in an IRA instead. If you're one of them, and neither you nor your spouse is covered by a retirement plan at work, then you'll get to deduct whatever contribution you made last year from your income.

The New Deal infrastructure programs of the 1930s are famous for putting unemployed Americans back to work, but that isn't all they achieved. Back then, economic opportunity was constrained by lack of access to good roads and electricity across much of the country.

If the Senate votes to convict, it then can vote to never let Trump hold office again. Keep that in the back of your head.

First, Biden has made clear that he believes in deliberate active governing rather than vague Darwinian market forces to optimize public programs. He already a Covid-19 response team led by capable experienced people whose job will be to organize and make decisions and do the many boring behind-the-scenes tasks of government.

There's very little evidence that they lead to the kind of (UNINTELLIGIBLE) understanding that Justice O'Connor talks about at Michigan, where they have segregated dorms and black-only graduations. And of course it's only one kind of diversity they talk about. When 91 percent of Ivy League law professors voted for Al Gore and Ralph Nader, I'd say they have a far bigger diversity problem on American elite campuses than whether or not...

In a single, memorable answer, Warren lambasted three of her opponents' health care plans. She called Buttigieg's proposal a slogan that was thought up by his consultants.

OBAMA: Senator Clinton and I have both campaigned in places like Iowa and Ohio and my home state of Illinois, and I think that the American people want fairness, want justice.

In order to address our dysfunctional early childhood education system, we must provide universal pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old in the country and greatly expand childcare.

Tempting as it may be to take advantage of those early-bird specials, if you're looking to save money in retirement, dining at home is a good way to do it. The typical restaurant charges a 300% markup for the food it serves, which means a $15 entree can usually be prepared for a mere $5 at home. While dining out on occasion can be a worthwhile treat, the more you cook at home, the less you'll spend on food overall.

And we are making it greater than ever before!

He vilified judges and courts for rulings he disliked, railed against the deep state and worked to undermine US intelligence agencies, attacked his own Cabinet members, and waged war against the oversight of his own administration by firing agency watchdogs. A recent directive from Trump makes it easier to push out career officials from the federal government and replace them with loyal political appointees.

Revisionist and cowardly Republicans spent the year waist-high in Denial, fruitlessly rewriting history to insist that the word privatize-- as of Social Security -- had never passed their craven lips.

I'm often asked whether dividends and capital-gains distributions that are paid in cash, as opposed to re-invested, should be included in calculating the withdrawal. The answer is yes. For example, if you plan to withdraw $40,000 in a given year and you will receive $15,000 in dividends or capital gains distributions in cash, then you would draw only $25,000 from your nest egg, so that the combination of dividends, distributions and the withdrawal gets you to your $40,000 target.

America's racial history remains, now more than ever, deeply contested. President Donald Trump's appointment of a 1776 Commission to teach patriotic education in our school systems attests to this. It is past time for national leadership that helps us clearly establish our past in all of its complexity. Understanding, for instance, racial slavery's expansive reach -- North and South -- into the creation of American capitalism gives students, citizens and leaders a more holistic appreciation of the stubborn afterlife of structural racism . The stickiness of America's current racial divide is rooted in a history that we continue to distort, gloss over or ignore at our very nation's peril.

CLINTON: Now, in addition, there are three ways we need to jump start the economy.
The actual architect of bail-reform initiatives may have been the tragic case of Kalief Browder, who was arrested when he was 16 in 2010 for allegedly stealing a backpack, and subsequently remanded to Rikers Island. A prior vehicle-theft conviction as a minor, along with his indigent family's inability to immediately produce the $900 necessary for bond, resulted in his incomprehensible pretrial detention of three years -- before the charges were ultimately dismissed for lack of evidence. Browder, the subject of a Netflix documentary, struggled to assimilate upon returning home, following long months of solitary confinement and brutalization by some prison guards and fellow inmates. He tragically took his own life on June 6, 2015. He was 22.

The purpose of the attack, in his view, is to subsidize the trillions in tax cuts contained in the new federal tax overhaul passed in December.
Term life insurance is the most basic type of life insurance coverage, but that doesn't mean it's any less valuable. With term life insurance, you'll typically pay a fixed premium in exchange for a fixed amount of coverage for a specific term or period, usually 10 to 30 years. If you pass away during the term of your policy, your family is paid the amount of your fixed death benefit.

Thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world, by far. With the tremendous progress we have made over the past 3 years, America is now energy independent, and energy jobs, like so many elements of our country, are at a record high. We are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just 3 years ago.
The US balance sheet was in tatters long before the pandemic erupted, as lawmakers have continually avoided making painful reforms to Social Security and Medicare. The deficit exploded during the Trump era amid bipartisan spending surges and GOP tax cuts, which failed to pay for themselves. The United States entered the pandemic with a $1 trillion deficit.
It immediately became apparent that what would become the Panama Papers had the potential to embarrass – or worse, implicate – world leaders and internationally sanctioned individuals, by linking them to offshore bank accounts that allegedly shielded wealth from taxes or authorities investigating wrongdoing.
It's really interesting, because the president used that very plan as a reason for seniors to accept his prescription drug plan. He said, if it's good enough for the congressmen and senators to have choice, seniors ought to have choice.
Greene responded that the Capitol attack was terrible and shouldn't have happened -- but then added that all of the people who died as a result of the insurrection were White, so I'm not sure where your white supremacy bs is coming from.
What people do is their own business, and if they decide to go out and buy guns they'll go out and buy guns, assuming that they are eligible to buy guns, John Podesta, the co-chairman of Obama's transition team, told reporters Sunday. But I think that President-elect Obama has been clear in his campaign that what he wants to focus on is the economy, trying to get jobs growing again, dealing with the health care crisis, and dealing with our dependence on foreign oil.
Now, I call on the Congress to give 1 million American children the same opportunity Janiyah has just received. Pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act -- because no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school.
A sweep by Democrats would allow for more ambitious spending programs once President-elect Joe Biden enters the White House. But it would also make corporate tax hikes more likely, which could jolt investors.

EDWARDS: Would you mind saying that...
There's no doubt in my mind that each person who has been executed in my state was guilty of their crime, he said, adding that if someone's innocent they shouldn't be put to death. All three candidates support the death penalty, but the Texas governor, by nature of his office, is the only candidate to have presided over executions. When the question was posed to McCain, he said that DNA technology would provoke a review of certain cases, but I certainly wouldn't abandon the death penalty. The death penalty is appropriate punishment as penalty for some crimes, McCain said.

For starters, while it's wonderful to get a hefty check from Uncle Sam after filing your tax return, that's not really such a great thing. After all, it's technically your own money that you're getting back, and the government has been hanging onto it until you filed your return. Modest refunds are common and not a problem, but big refunds generally happen when we have too much withheld from our paychecks. You can adjust your withholding by submitting another W-4 form to your employer.
HUNT: But afterwards, they'll go through the (UNINTELLIGIBLE) thing, and you can build on this, and John McCain and Kate are right.

The forgiveness process is simpler. In order to have a PPP loan forgiven, businesses that borrowed $150,000 or less will simply need to submit a one-page certification that includes the number of employees the business retained as a result of the loan, an estimate of how much of the loan was spent on payroll and the total loan amount. Borrowers must also attest that the information is accurate and that they complied with loan requirements.

It isn't hard to pick up on the narrative Mitchell has established regarding his NFL demise. The infamous rift between Owens and McNabb was brewing just as the Eagles released Mitchell, and he and Owens were allies. It's possible Reid and the front office considered those politics when they cut Mitchell, but there's little doubt that Owens also rendered Mitchell more expendable on the field in 2004.

That trend continues to hit Microsoft, but seems like it may be leveling off.
And it is a stark admission of failure by the federal government. We need comprehensive immigration reform. I have been for this. I signed onto the first comprehensive bill back in 2004. I've been advocating for it: tougher, more secure borders, of course, but let's do it the right way, cracking down on employers, especially once we get to comprehensive immigration reform, who exploit undocumented workers and drive down wages for everyone else.
As the world bears witness tonight, America is a land of heroes. This is the place where greatness is born, where destinies are forged, and where legends come to life. This is the home of Thomas Edison and Teddy Roosevelt, of many great Generals, including Washington, Pershing, Patton, and MacArthur. This is the home of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers, Neil Armstrong, and so many more. This is the country where children learn names like Wyatt Earp, Davy Crockett, and Annie Oakley. This is the place where the pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas patriots made their last stand at the Alamo.
The Trump administration sought to remove millions of people from public assistance programs over the last four years, but in many cases, these efforts failed to be finalized before the end of the President's tenure or failed to hold up in court.

It's a bittersweet milestone for GM (GM) because it means that a $7,500 government tax credit for its customers will soon expire.
That can be a good thing. Such jobs don't require as much education, which helps keep unemployment low because the skills of the local labor force fit the work available — unlike in very high-skilled markets like Washington D.C., which have large populations that lack the education necessary to compete for the specialized jobs that exist there.
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin asked a Georgia rally crowd in December, Is this a representation of the Democrats' heart in Georgia, to have a pro-abortion pastor who's running?

I do not understand why the Democrats don't have the courage of our convictions and make the case that our policies will lead to growth, Khanna said, arguing that the rule was ultimately a self-defeating political calculation: PAYGO is to protect members in vulnerable districts who can say that Democrats are for fiscal responsibility. I'm all for raising taxes on the 1% and multinational corporations and stopping our excessive spending on the bad wars. But we should make an economic growth argument in swing districts instead of thinking the '90s playbook of fiscal responsibility will work.
The National Endowment for the Arts didn't exist in the 1930s, Taylor said. We don't have to start from scratch like the Federal Writers' Project did.

Those days are now over. Democrats can now do Trump real political damage using the official means of their House majority. While they may not be able to, say, force his tax returns into public view (the jury remains out on that), they can make sure the issue is front and center and create major distractions for a White House that has already shown it can distract itself very well, thank you very much.

What made Reagan different from many of his fellow conservatives -- and different, too, from liberals who looked upon the Cold War as an eternal condition -- was that he really wanted to negotiate and thought he had learned the art of doing so by bargaining with movie producers when he was president of the Screen Actors Guild, Lou Cannon, author of several books on Reagan, wrote in a commentary for AOL News.
The most lasting part of Trump's climate legacy -- and one that cannot be undone -- may be the time the administration wasted in the face of a worsening climate crisis, some scientists and experts say.

While the Trump administration does have new agreements with all Guatemala and Honduras, those agreements are related to the handling of people who come to the US seeking asylum, not criminals the US is seeking to deport.

In December, the company had to set prices for 2019 without knowing if there would be a 10% or 25% tariff on their imports. Trump had threatened to raise the tariff rate to 25% on January 1, but put off the hike while he and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day truce that ends in March.

The president is, in effect, allowing federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research to the extent that it's permitted by law -- that is, work with stem cells themselves, not the derivation of stem cells, Varmus said in a conference call with reporters Sunday.
SHAMBAUGH: Well, there is some evidence that this is the story that the Chinese military told the Chinese leadership, indeed that the local Guangdong Chinese military region sent up the line. And once the Chinese leadership received that story, they put it out to their own people and to the world. And once you do that, you can't back down. Now they obviously have diametrically opposed information from the American side.

It is possible Trump was taking an actual poll result and adding 10 points to his approval rating because of what he called the Trump 'thing' -- what he claims is a phenomenon in which his supporters decline to tell pollsters that they support him.

Reuters Bill Clinton The roaring 1990s were very kind to Wall Street. Stocks spiked — the S&P 500 increased 210% under President Bill Clinton — as investors celebrated the rise of the Internet and brisk economic growth. Clinton presided over two of the S&P 500's top 10 years: 1995 and 1997. GDP topped 4% in five of Clinton's eight years in the White House. Inflation remained stable. Unemployment dipped below 4%. And the United States enjoyed the longest period of uninterrupted economic growth in modern history. The era was punctuated by the dotcom boom, which amounted to the creation of an entirely new industry. The Nasdaq spiked sevenfold between 1993 and its peak in early 2000. The mania created vast amounts of wealth — much of which would disappear as the bubble inevitably popped. 1st term +79% Jan. 20, 1993 – Jan. 20, 1997 2nd term +73% Jan. 20, 1997 – Jan. 20, 2001

There is no doubt that the steel industry had declined from its heyday: the number of people working in iron and steel mills or in making steel products fell from more than 250,000 in 1990 to under 150,000 by 2016.

While a tax cut may represent a notable drop in average tax burden, it doesn't necessarily represent a big jump in one's after-tax income, which is a better measure of how a tax cut changes someone's economic situation. For example, Mississippi residents will see their average federal tax burden drop by $1,040, or 9.5% on average. But that only represents a jump of 1.8% in after-tax income.
So far, Congress has responded by passing Cares Act, a $2 trillion economic stimulus bill, the largest aid package in US history, and President Donald Trump signed the bill on March 27.
BIDEN: Look, one of the things I'm not going to get into, because it got news before, is when I was asked -- I don't even have the nomination, and I'm presuming who I might pick as a vice president.

Like John, one of the things that I'm always inspired by -- no, I'm -- this I'm serious about. I'm always inspired by young men and women who grew up in the South when segregation was still taking place, when, you know, the transformations that are still incomplete but at least had begun had not yet begun.

The stage of the presidency has helped Trump radicalize thousands (of mostly White people) to do his evil bidding. Moreover, his environmental, immigration and tax policies will cause harm long after Trump leaves office. The regularity of his debauchery has lulled us into forgetting he retreated to his dark hole of selfishness in the fight against Covid-19. If all that doesn't inform you that we must take any opportunity to stop him, then you probably share the same moral compass as Trump.

Federal Reserve officials believe the sweet spot is about 2% inflation and 3% to 3.5% wage growth. We're close.
Facts First: This is partly true. As the experience of Italy and other countries shows, having universal coverage and a government-run health system is not enough on its own to stem the spread of coronavirus. But the US is at a disadvantage in fighting the coronavirus because tens of millions of Americans are uninsured or face high out-of-pocket costs before their insurance kicks in -- which may make people hesitant to seek testing or treatment.

In recent years, the IRS's budget has been repeatedly slashed. As a result, it's been forced to reduce its personnel, including auditors. The inevitable result is a steep decline in audit rates: Fewer than 1% of taxpayers are audited these days, and as the budget cuts continue, this rate will likely drop further.

It is unacceptable that there are employers paying women less than men for the same work. As President, I will finish the Obama-Biden administration's work on ending unequal pay. The very first bill the Obama-Biden administration signed was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which made it easier for women to fight back if they were unfairly paid less than their male coworkers. We also protected more workers against retaliation for discussing wages and required employers to collect and report wage gaps to the federal government. As President, I will build on this critical work by signing into law the Paycheck Fairness Act.

Signing up 20 months late, for example, will add $7.10 per month to your Part D premiums. It pays to arrange for Medicare coverage in advance so that you don't wind up paying more than you need to.

(CNN) President-elect Joe Biden is inheriting a national crisis that has built up over 40 years. On January 20, 1981, former President Ronald Reagan took the US on a radical course when he declared in his inaugural address , In the present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. He set out to weaken the federal government by slashing taxes on the rich, dismantling regulations , cutting back on public programs and turning many of the nation's problems back to the states.
An analysis published last week by the Wharton School found a strong correlation between higher oil prices and higher business spending across the country.
The next dumb thing you can do with your 401(k) is to invest in suboptimal ways in it.

The next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. Yet, for too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools. To rescue these students, 18 States have created school choice in the form of Opportunity Scholarships. The programs are so popular, that tens of thousands of students remain on waiting lists. One of those students is Janiyah Davis, a fourth grader from Philadelphia. Janiyah's mom Stephanie is a single parent. She would do anything to give her daughter a better future. But last year, that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania's Governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice for 50,000 children.
Sitting beside Iain tonight is his great hero. Charles McGee was born in Cleveland, Ohio, one century ago.

Before Covid-19 struck, tourists were arriving in often unmanageable numbers, choking the main streets and filling up the waterbuses. Authorities had tried various measures, from introducing separate residents' lines at major vaporetto (waterbus) stops to bringing in turnstiles that would filter locals from tourists on busy days. A planned entrance tax, due to debut in 2020, has been postponed to January 2022 , due to the pandemic.

There is also a good precedent: When Brazil last impeached a president, in 1992, nobody expected much of the inexperienced successor. Yet Itamar Franco recognized his role as a transitional figure, built consensus and laid the groundwork for a successful wave of pro-market reform.
Trump cynically and effectively depicted that earlier impeachment as partisan and remained in office, as only one Republican US senator, Mitt Romney, dared to defy the vengeful president.

It is true that America must move forward, but it's dangerous to believe that it can only do that by ignoring the recent past.

Consider this from Trump during the campaign in 2015, explaining the rationale for his favorite edifice:
Which begs the question: Why did the Fed raise rates in September and December in the first place? There were almost seven million open jobs in November last year, and 2018 saw the lowest unemployment rate since the 1960s and is on track to see real economic growth of more than 3% for the first time since 2005. Average hourly pay was up. And inflation of consumer prices even before the rate hikes have been pretty flat, growing at about 1% to 2%, which is right in the sweet zone that the Fed targets.
This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.
We're locked now in a daily battle over a government that most people want reopened that is being held hostage for a wall that won't work and which a majority of Americans don't want. Someone is getting stuck with the bill for Trump's show, and that someone is going to be the Senate GOP unless it acts – and acts soon – to end the shutdown.
Irrespective of whether this President serves one term or two, America's 17th chief justice is already bound for an unusual union with the 45th President, arising from the combination of Trump's impeachment trial, Supreme Court litigation and their dueling notions of an impartial federal judiciary.
Nor is Singapore some small-state nirvana. Its government has taken a highly interventionist approach to its economy, investing deeply in its nascent industries. Much of Singapore's land is nationalized and more than 80% of the population lives in well-built, state subsidized public housing that has ethnic quotas, which are rigidly enforced – something that will be hard to swallow in democratic polities. It has a level of intrusiveness that doesn't come comfortably to the liberal mind, Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam told the BBC in 2015.

But he never really needed Democrats to do much of anything, either. The Republican majorities in the House and Senate ensured Trump got his tax cuts and two Supreme Court picks. There was no real political penalty for his total unwillingness and inability to work with Democrats.

While Social Security alone won't let you live a lifestyle of the rich and famous, it's fair to ask how much guaranteed income you really need above Social Security. Other than health-related costs, most retirees find that their expenses actually go down when they're retired. If you don't need additional guaranteed income, you might be better off with the greater flexibility that you get outside of annuities.
Your chances of being audited are very low -- and were recently less than 1 in 100. Don't think it's all a matter of chance, though, because there are factors that can make an audit more likely. For example, if you have earnings that are well above average, you'll be more likely to have your return audited. If you're self-employed, you'll be more likely to be audited, as well, because it can be easier for a self-employed person to fudge numbers than it is for a salaried person.

This is overstated. Available Customs and Border Protection data shows a total of 396,579 people were apprehended by the US Border Patrol for fiscal year 2018 at the southwest border, which would mean an average of 1,087 each day – hardly the thousands that Trump purports. The numbers differ each month. The highest number of apprehensions was in September, with a daily average of nearly 1,400.

(CNN) With the presidential inauguration approaching, in the wake of President Donald Trump being impeached yet again, some politicians have made their proverbial cry for unity. Such calls ring especially hollow given recent events.
Heavy turnout in St. Louis, a Democratic stronghold in the battleground state of Missouri, prompted a judge to extend polling there by three hours. He was overruled later by a state appellate judge after Republicans appealed the decision. An official in the New York borough of Manhattan said he was calling in more volunteers to get help because turnout was greater than he had expected. In the Atlanta, Georgia, area, voters waited as long as three hours to enter voting booths. In the Chicago suburb of Lake Forest, Illinois, poll workers reported the turnout was much better than anything we've seen before. Gore's campaign deployed the Rev. Jesse Jackson in Pennsylvania on Tuesday afternoon and called on Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy's organization to send volunteers to New Hampshire for get-out-the-vote efforts there. I believe we have the best ground troops in America knocking on doors, getting on phones for Gore, Donna Brazile, the vice president's campaign manager, said Tuesday evening. The Gore campaign estimated that it put about 50,000 volunteers into the field during the campaign, sent 50 million pieces of direct mail, made 40 million phone calls and sent 30 million pieces of e-mail by the time polls closed Tuesday. Bush strategist Karl Rove said Monday the Bush campaign sent as many as 243,000 volunteers onto the streets in 28 battleground states, making up to 70 million phone calls and sending out 110 million pieces of mail.

Many people have income that's lumpy, with high income in some years and next to none in others. That can be less than ideal for your tax situation: You can end up paying higher tax rates on portions of your income during good years, while not making full use of low tax brackets during bad ones.

Beyond the politics, many of the Republican members of the Senate seem to have a growing awareness of just how consequential and dangerous the shutdown has become for the American economy and the American people. Washington has spent the last two years with Stockholm syndrome Republicans either defending or explaining away Trump and Trumpism. Often, they found a pathway to shrug off his behavior and minimize the consequences of Trump's reckless and divisive leadership, but now the cracks are showing.

Cuomo has been blunt and at times searching, but unerringly forthright, even with unnerving information. He has been open in seeking out the equipment desperately needed by health care providers, like face masks and ventilators. Asked on Friday if the state was headed toward a cash crunch, he answered, Yes.

The reasoning behind much of Trump's trade moves, he and his allies asserted, was to bring back jobs from overseas. But tacking on tariffs, relaxing economic regulations and lowering taxes could have a limited effect on the repatriation of job opportunities for Americans lost to cheaper labor abroad, and foreign direct investment in the US declined significantly during the first two years of Trump's tenure.
The central problem today with the income tax is not its rate structure, but with what it covers – and what it doesn't cover. In particular, the income tax rates do not apply to unrealized appreciation, which is what happens when the rich get richer without so much as touching actual cash. To illustrate, the radical corporate income tax cuts in President Trump's signature tax bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, led to a rise in stock prices that benefitted stock owners, tax-free. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, for one ready example, got a one-time $29 billion windfall from Trump's tax cuts. As the principal owner, Buffett himself benefited to the tune of billions. But Buffett paid no tax on his very good day.

Free agency is supposed to be a reward for players who have paid their dues, and it didn't work this year. That does not mean this deal is bad or irredeemable. We have to wait and see, and we have to make it work for us. The unfortunate thing is the players who do get caught [waiting for a contract].
The implications of who wins the challenges and thus the Senate could be swift. Biden backs repealing the Hyde Amendment, a provision in congressional funding bills since 1976 that currently bars federal funds from going toward abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is at risk. Biden's position comes after making a dramatic shift during the Democratic primaries from his long-held support for the provision.

Distilling the view that this disparity is driven by differences in individual character rather than outcomes created by public policy, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) weighed in on a proposal to repeal the estate tax during the debate by telling the Des Moines Register in 2017: I think not having the estate tax recognizes the people that are investing, as opposed to those that are just spending every darn penny they have, whether it's on booze or women or movies.

Normally the very highest income households don't get to take advantage of the exemption levels, at least not in full. But the new law greatly expands how many of them can.
Or you can take a less formal approach. Every year or so you can go to a retirement income calculator that estimates the chances that your nest egg will last throughout retirement and plug in your current savings balance and planned withdrawals. If the calculator shows that your chances of depleting your nest egg have risen significantly in recent years, then you may want to scale back your planned withdrawal. If your chances of running through your savings have dropped precipitously, then you might consider boosting the amount you pull from savings.

In Trump's first year in office in 2017, he announced that he planned to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement on climate.

Rep. Jayapal on Sen. Johnson: Stunning that a senator would say these things
The justices by 5-to-4 votes, conservatives over liberals, let Trump divert funds to build the wall at the US southern border; to institute a new rule disadvantaging green-card applicants who seek food stamps and other public assistance; and, most recently, to reinstate a Food and Drug Administration requirement that women prescribed mifepristone, to end a pregnancy in its early weeks, pick up the pill in person at a hospital or clinic despite the Covid-19 pandemic.
I don't trust Congress; I trust people and I want to give people their money back -- grown-up or non-grown-up, Bush said. Either you trust the people or you trust government. His five-year, $483 billion tax cut plan would spend more of the surplus on tax cuts than McCain's. On the same day that Democratic presidential front-runner Al Gore received the endorsement of a major abortion-rights group, the Republican rivals argued over who was the most anti-abortion candidate. The political questions around abortions are these and this is one that's gonna differentiate us from the Democratic nominee, Bush said when McCain questioned him on his pro-life stance and whether he supported the right to an abortion in cases of rape, incest or to preserve a woman's life. I will sign a ban on partial-birth abortion, Bush said of a controversial late-term abortion procedure that Congress has twice passed and the president has twice vetoed. We need to keep the platform the way it is, bush said of the GOP plank that calls for a consitutional amendment banning abortion. The Texas governor reaffirmed his support for the death penalty when asked whether he would follow the lead of Gov. George Ryan (R-Illinois), who suspended executions in the state after 13 death row inmates were found innocent. Bush insisted that every inmate executed on his watch was guilty.

Still, the change in the value of those deferred assets will cost Citigroup $19 billion. The remaining $3 billion charge comes from bringing earnings from foreign subsidiaries back to the United States. That change is also a provision of the new tax law.
And if the Republican leadership is going to insist that 60 votes in the Senate are required to do any business at all in this town, a supermajority, then the responsibility to govern is now yours, as well. Just saying no to everything may be good short-term politics, but it's not leadership. We were sent here to serve our citizens, not our ambitions.
My Administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies. We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs, and medicines are being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before.

Eventually, they hope that the data will help create a more sustainable tourism plan for the future.

Karkkainen noted that the vast majority of proposed actions assessed by the federal government under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) sail through without having to go through an Environmental Impact Statement process, the most comprehensive form of environmental review. Precise numbers for road and highway projects are not available, but in 2014, the Obama administration's Council on Environmental Quality estimated that about 95% of all analyses under NEPA (not only for highway projects) were classified as Categorical Exclusions, meaning that the proposals did not require either the full Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or even the quicker process known as an Environmental Assessment (EA).

Create more generous Health Savings Accounts. Seeking to get more people to save money for health care expenses, the Republican bill includes several provisions aimed at making Health Savings Accounts more attractive.

Traditional brokerage accounts, by contrast, require you to pay taxes on your gains year after year. This means that if you sell anything in your account at a profit, you'll lose a chunk of those proceeds to taxes, leaving you less money to reinvest.

Republican aides and members opposed to this effort are watching this play out and hoping that voters will have moved on from Trump in the next several years. The hope is that this vote does not become a litmus test for whether outside groups wage primary challenges against those who were not loyal to the President in his last days in office. Only time will tell how consequential this vote will really be. Still, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has warned members that for him, it is one of the most important of his career.

Biden's relief proposal now shifts to Congress, where it may change substantially as Democratic leaders transform it into a bill. They must decide whether they want to use a special legislative process called reconciliation, which would require only a simple majority of votes to pass the Senate -- eliminating the need for Republican support -- but would limit the provisions that could be included. Also, reconciliation could be used only sparingly each year.

In his Nerd's Eye View blog, financial planner Michael Kitces has pointed out that since the late 1800s there have been a number of times when bond yields have been low and stocks have performed abysmally. Still, Kitces notes that a portfolio invested 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds following the 4% rule has never ran out of money over a 30-year period. Indeed, more often than not someone with that asset mix and adhering to the rule would have ended up with more than double the amount they started with after 30 years.

Missouri is the site of one of the nation's most competitive Senate races. Sen. Claire McCaskill, who represents that state, which voted for Trump by almost 19 points, is one of the most vulnerable Democrats up in 2018. She faces Republican state Attorney General Josh Hawley in a race that both sides are focusing on for control of the upper chamber. Democrats have attacked Hawley's record as attorney general and focused on health care, while Republicans have criticized McCaskill for voting against the Republican tax bill and using a private plane to get around the state. McCaskill won re-election in 2012, when Obama lost Missouri by 10 points, but the state has moved to the right since then.

That said, there are two possible reasons why Cohen may not testify about Trump Organization misdeeds on February 7. It appears that, at least as of the date of his sentencing in December, Cohen refused to cooperate on matters other than the campaign finance crimes with prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, according to SDNY's sentencing submission. This would presumably include information related to potential criminal conduct at the Trump Organization aside from the campaign finance crime.

Of course, you could compensate for taxes by increasing the amount you withdraw. For example, if you're pulling money from a traditional IRA and you're being taxed at the new federal 24% tax rate, you could withdraw roughly $52,600 so you'd end up with $40,000 after taxes. But then you would have increased your withdrawal rate to almost 5.3%, and a higher withdrawal rate would increase your chances of depleting your nest egg prematurely.

This is a matter, I think, of some real urgency, Blinken said of the envoy position, which was left empty under Trump. We've seen violence directed against LGBTQI people around the world increase. We've seen, I believe, the highest number of murders of transgender people, particularly women of color, that we've seen ever. And so I think the United States playing the role that it should be playing in standing up for and defending the rights of LGBTQI people is something that the department is going to take on and take on immediately.
President Donald Trump continued this approach -- passing massive tax cuts in 2017, and then when calamity hit with Covid-19 in 2020, placing the burden of response on the states. It is Biden's historic task to reverse Reagan's -- and Trump's -- reckless radicalism.
Still, the move marks a shift from Trump's efforts to advance oil pipelines and support the industry broadly.

After cotton crumbled, Hancock was destitute, the book explains. Before the Voting Rights Act of 1965, it had no Black elected officials until John McCown -- an activist more in the mold of Stokely Carmichael than Martin Luther King Jr. -- came to town, luring investment and ushering Black residents to power
BROWN: I think one of the points -- I think one of the points that John King was alluding to in talking about some of Senator Clinton's comments is there has been a lot of attention lately on some of your speeches, that they are very similar to some of the speeches by your friend and supporter Deval Patrick, the governor of Massachusetts, and Senator Clinton's campaign has made a big issue of this. To be blunt, they've accused you of plagiarism.
The President was home alone, not hobnobbing with the likes of Fabio and Sylvester Stallone at Mar-a-Lago, because he wanted to make a point about staying in Washington during the government shutdown. Of course, it was a shutdown he caused, with a foot-stamping demand for money for a wall along the Mexico border. The same wall he repeatedly promised Mexico would pay for.
Tax payment delay -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that most Americans -- anyone making less than $1 million or companies making less than $10 million -- will get an extra 90 days to pay their taxes with no penalty.
While identity theft in one form or another is probably as old as mankind, it didn't become a significant issue until fairly recently. For example, the rise of credit cards meant that fraudsters could simply steal someone's wallet and go on a spending spree with their cards instead of being limited to whatever cash was in the victim's possession. And computers and the internet provide fraudsters with unprecedented access to sensitive financial information. In 2016 alone, 15.4 million Americans were victims of identity theft.

Ellie reminds us that every child is a miracle of life. Thanks to modern medical wonders, 50 percent of very premature babies delivered at the hospital where Ellie was born now survive. Our goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like Ellie. That is why I am asking the Congress to provide an additional $50 million to fund neo-natal research for America's youngest patients. That is also why I am calling upon the Members of Congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late-term abortion of babies.
Once you hit age 70½, the IRS requires you to withdraw a certain minimum amount from your tax-deferred retirement accounts every year. It doesn't want you to be able to hang on to that money forever; after a certain point, it wants to be able to start collecting taxes on the money in these accounts. Thus, you'll be forced to take distributions (and pay taxes on them) whether or not you actually need the income. And because the distributions are taxed as income, this can cause all kinds of other tax complications such as raising your tax bracket (and your capital gains rate as a result), and making your Social Security benefits partially taxable.

To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare!
I've heard so many leaders say, 'Oh, I'm a feminist,' Lagarde told Richard Quest of CNNMoney. To all those who have declared themselves feminists -- and I applaud them and I continue to applaud them -- let's make sure that we hold them to account and that they actually demonstrate what they preach.
The coronavirus, known as Covid-19, may be unique in the way it is transmitting itself and in its relative lethality. But the fundamentals of what a solid response entails and recovery to an emergency are remarkably consistent across any level of government, whether it be a public health threat, natural disaster or other crisis.
Third, higher tax burdens on the wealthy would reduce (what economists call) rent seeking, the appropriation of wealth from others without creating new wealth. Studies have shown that countries with lower top marginal tax rates have higher pre-tax income inequality. The logic is that, while lower tax rates on high-income households — introduced in the Reagan, Bush and Trump tax cuts — may have stimulated labor supply and saving, they also raised the return to rent seeking, encouraging, for example, executives to capture a larger share of profits, at the expense of wage earners. Thus, some of the top 1%'s impressive gains may well have come at the expense of, rather than benefit to, the rest of the population.

Given that lots of the hole [in spending] was not from the fact that people don't want to spend, but that they can't spend because they can't take a flight or they can't go to a restaurant, said Larry Summers, in a recent interview on Bloomberg . Summers served as a top economist in the early days of the Obama administration. I don't necessarily think the priority should be on promoting consumer spending beyond where we are now.

Forbes pulls the plug after five years, bows out of GOP presidential race Millionaire publisher heads back to 'Forbes' magazine By Ian Christopher McCaleb/CNN WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Steve Forbes traded in the keys of his presidential campaign bus on Thursday for a return trip to his editing desk at 'Forbes' magazine, by opting to end his self-financed, five year-tenure as a Republican presidential candidate. At an appearance in Washington, Forbes made the expected announcement that he would abandon his GOP presidential bid. As my father once said when he lost a governor's race in New Jersey: 'We were nosed out by a landslide,' quipped Forbes, who was flanked by his wife Sabina, two of his five daughters, national campaign manager Ken Blackwell, and Georgia Republican Rep. Bob Barr, a staunch supporter. I have no regrets, and you shouldn't either, Forbes told the boisterous group of supporters that attended his departure announcement at a Washington hotel. I am withdrawing from the presidential contest but I am not withdrawing from the public square, Forbes said, adding after being pressed by reporters that he plans, for the time being, to return to 'Forbes' magazine, where he is chief executive officer and editor-in-chief. I will be going back to 'Forbes' magazine, he said. As a matter of fact, tomorrow I have to write some editorials. Deadlines are deadlines. Forbes did say, however, that he has not ruled out running for elective office at a later date. I'm not ruling anything out, he said.

(CNN) Congress has just passed a historic $2 trillion stimulus package that was signed into law by President Donald Trump on Friday afternoon.

Despite Guajardo's optimism, he isn't taking Trump's threats lightly, and he's looking at other countries in the world to expand trade relationships. This year, he's already met with or announced plans to meet with officials from the European Union, China, Brazil and Argentina.
Last week, he unveiled a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus plan that he wants to push through Congress, and on Wednesday -- his first day in office -- he signed executive orders that extend eviction protections for renters and payment deferrals for student loan borrowers.
In the wake of Trump's promise, the White House walked back expectations that a comprehensive plan would be ready. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has only said that more details of the plan will be revealed.

Just a complete fabrication.

It was an eclectic batch of dishonesty. Among other things, Trump took unearned credit for both the Ethiopia-Eritrea peace agreement and for the drop in the US cancer death rate, absurdly claimed that NATO had no money before his presidency, wrongly denied that his golf excursions cost taxpayers any money, and repeated his usual varied inaccuracies about impeachment, immigration and the nuclear agreement with Iran.

Finally, don't interfere with your 401(k) account's growth. Many people cash out their 401(k) accounts when they leave a job.

If you withdraw just $20,000 that might have remained invested for 20 years, averaging 8% annual growth, you miss out on more than $90,000 in future funds.

On March 13, just after the World Health Organization classified the coronavirus a pandemic, and as President Donald Trump declared a national emergency, the Bureau of Prisons took its most aggressive step, banning all social visitors and most lawyers from all facilities across the country. Carvajal said it is the most serious response since 1995 when the entire federal prison went on a complete lockdown after a series of riots. Prison officials were told to cut down on the transfers of inmates between facilities, and an automatic two-week quarantine was soon after implemented for all new inmates entering a facility.

From the outset of the Third Reich under Hitler's leadership, Germany made life difficult for Jews. They were forced out of jobs, physically harassed, and expelled from universities.

A relentless propaganda campaign reinforced these legal maneuvers: posters, cartoons, children's books, and newspaper articles depicted Jews as Germany and the world's misfortune.

Ideally, the answer will spur you to take action to improve your retirement outlook as much as you can.

The first step in growing your net worth is setting a goal for yourself. If you set a goal, you can also create a specific plan that will take you to that goal; if you don't have a goal, how can you decide what to do next? For example, let's say that you are the 40-year-old in the previous example and your net worth is $40,000. You're doing a bit better than the average, but you really want to get your net worth up to where the formula from the book says it should be, which is $240,000. You need to increase your net worth by $200,000 to get there. Now that you have a specific number, you can set a timeframe and mini-goals to get you to your ultimate goal no later than your deadline.

Bush received backing from The (Portland) Oregonian, The Seattle Times, The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer, The Columbus (Ohio) Dispatch, The Detroit News and The Dallas Morning News. Focus shifts to Electoral College With the national race so close, attention is moving to the state-by-state contest to win the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency. One estimate by veteran political analyst Hal Bruno for the Politics.com Internet site gave Bush 213 electoral votes and Gore 186, with 139 votes up for grabs and too close to call. But individual state polls in the Midwest appeared to indicate that Gore's position was weakening in the toughest battleground of the nation. An Illinois poll, for example, showed him leading on Sunday by just 45 percent to 43 percent, well within the poll's margin of error. Last month, the vice president led by a double-digit figure in that state. Reuters contributed to this report.

The state and local taxes that you pay, including real estate taxes, qualify as an itemized deduction. This can help push you into the itemizing makes sense category if you're close but not quite there. Note that you can deduct either state income tax or state sales tax, but not both; usually, it makes more sense to deduct the state income tax, but if your state has low or no income tax, then deducting your sales tax is the way to go.

Fundamental economic conditions shape the outlook for growth more than the policies of any president.

Second, 2021 must see a coordinated effort at the local, state and national levels to eradicate the thousands of racist policies that keep too many Black Americans at the bottom of the well of this society. Criminal justice reform is the tip of the iceberg on this score. Eliminating the cash bail system and disparate sentencing for crack versus powdered cocaine, releasing non-violent drug offenders and transforming a juvenile justice system that disproportionately harms Black children should be at the top of the policy agenda.
On the flip-side, sometimes we see bigotry defended with big words, pseudo-science and high-minded phrases. That's when it's worth remembering that opponents of civil rights often wrapped their defenses of hate in constitutional arguments, just as slave owners cited the bible a century before.

COBB: Absolutely not. We have so much work to do. And so, as Allison was saying, some of that work is just reading into those regional reports, the report has region by region what are the expected impacts, and thinking about how scientists can work with people in their communities and policymakers to protect those communities today from the impacts that are coming down the pike today, actually. And so the other bucket of the recommendations that they make is of course to get on top of our emissions and start to make sure that we are not baking in more risk than we need to. It is absolutely not too late and we really have time to get to work.

Millions of Americans who viewed the twice-impeached Trump's assaults on decency and the rule of law with shame and alarm will finally be able to breathe easily again, liberated from his strongman's shadow. Biden will be a President who seeks to unify an internally estranged nation in contrast to Trump's obsession with ripping at its social, racial and cultural fault lines to cement his power. Trump's cynical weaponizing of race reemerged on Monday when his White House chose the national holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr. to issue a commission report that minimizes slavery and insults the modern civil rights movement.
One person who stood between Trump and more sweeping success was Chief Justice John Roberts . The administration lost major cases at the Supreme Court when Roberts gave his decisive vote to the liberal side of the bench.

We become a viable watchdog party on the two parties, telling them they need to shape up or they're going to lose votes in the future. Meanwhile, Reform Party candidate Buchanan -- who secured $12.6 million in federal matching funds after the party's raucous convention in August -- said Monday he would be around to serve as a conservative watchdog over a Republican administration. Buchanan earned less than 1 percent of the popular vote after inheriting the mantle of Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who won 8 percent in 1996 and 19 percent in 1992. Buchanan had challenged Bush's father in the 1992 Republican primaries. Asked about the likelihood of a Bush win, Buchanan said, If there is another Bush in the White House, there will be another Buchanan watchdog right outside the White House.

BUCK: Well, you know, he came off, I think, so much better than he did on the debate stage, than he has in some of the early cycles, news cycles of this Democratic primary. And so it begs the question why hasn't he been doing more one on one, sit-down interviews like this? Why hasn't he been going out there to present his story, to explain his positions, to defend his positions in a way that wasn't as confrontational as what you might see on the debate stage? You know, I think this format does him a lot of favors.
Also critical is whether governments are able to coordinate their response to the outbreak, ideally with help from multinational institutions.

The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has not yet ruled on Stone associate Andrew Miller's attempt to dodge a subpoena and his challenge of Mueller's authority. Miller lost his case before a trial-level judge and was held in contempt of court, then appealed. If he wins, the court could undercut Mueller's appointment within the Justice Department. But if the appeals court sticks with the trial judge's findings and Miller still refuses to testify, he could go to jail.

While the reported number of sickened inmates represents less than half a percent of the total federal prison system, the rapid spread of the virus behind the walls of the Bureau of Prison's 122 facilities has mirrored the outside world, and new clusters of the pandemic have emerged at prisons across the country with alarming speed.

Similarly, even if you're willing, you may not be able to stay on the job as long as you prefer. For example, nearly four in 10 workers said they don't plan to retire until after age 65, according to a recent Gallup poll. At the same time, though, the Employee Benefit Research Institute's 2017 Retirement Confidence Survey shows that nearly half of retirees said they retired earlier than they planned, often because they had a health problem or had to care for a spouse or other relative or because they were simply ousted from their job.

This is a great thing. Trump also pulled the US out of the near-worldwide Paris Climate Agreement and has shown little interest in doing anything to restrict the emissions that create global warming. Side note: it was hovering around 59 degrees in Washington as he delivered the speech. In February. A couple of weeks ago, after it hit 70 — in January — the official White House account tweeted a somewhat misleading picture of snow falling earlier in the month.

So if Trump imposes a 20% ($59.2 billion) tariff on $296 billion worth of Mexican imports, Mexico could legally impose the same amount on US exports to Mexico. Every dollar we illegally tax on Mexican products is a dollar that Mexico can lawfully tax on US products.

But we've had this conversation before, Senator Obama and myself, and I believe that we should have full diplomatic engagement where appropriate.

The book is a rallying cry against what Harris views as the un-American policies of the Trump administration, alongside her set of policy alternatives. She casts herself as a champion for everyday Americans against the powerful, and she is unsparing in her disdain for the policies of President Donald Trump.

Taxing wealth, however, could be very difficult to do. First, there are questions about whether it is permitted by the US Constitution, with legal scholars falling on both sides of the argument.

Push provision for bigger tax credits for older Americans to Senate. The House is setting aside roughly $85 billion in funding to provide additional tax credits to help older people buy policies on the individual market. But representatives are letting the Senate handle the crafting of the legislation.

I've been watching each of you give speeches in arenas not unlike this one individually. And the tone is often quite different than the very polite, substantive discourse we've had tonight.
Facts First: Trump's approval rating among Republicans is very high, regularly in the 80s and sometimes creeping into the 90s, but it has not been 95% in any recent major poll we could find.

Enrollment, which isn't final until consumers pay their first month's premium, typically drops during the year as participants stop making payments or find coverage elsewhere.

Biden wants to send $350 billion to state, local and territorial governments to keep their frontline workers employed, distribute the vaccine, increase testing, reopen schools and maintain vital services.
But the congresswoman's particular idea for change nonetheless falls short.
A post-Trump presidency impeachment which, as some have called for, includes a ban on him seeking office again, might bring premature and incomplete closure to this ugly chapter of American democracy.
The bottom line is that the US has very low taxation as a share of GDP (in fact, the lowest among all high-income countries in the OECD except Ireland), insufficient public services, decrepit infrastructure, and massive debts and deficits -- all at the same time!
However, Biden's stimulus plan will face opposition in Congress. Zandi expects Biden's American Rescue Plan will get whittled down to just $750 billion. That in turn would leave US GDP growth at about 5%.

It's already sure to be a focal point of the 2020 election. The law's future is at the center of the Democratic presidential primary, with more moderate candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg saying they want to expand on Obamacare by allowing Americans to buy into a Medicare-style public insurance option. More progressive candidates like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen.

Biden would extend the 15% increase in food stamp benefits through September, instead of having it expire in June. He would invest another $3 billion to help women, infants and children secure food, and give US territories $1 billion in nutrition assistance. And he would partner with restaurants to provide food to needy Americans and jobs to laid-off restaurant workers.

And one of the things, Adam Schiff, he's the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he said yesterday that he in fact wants to look at any links between the Trump administration, the Trump Organization, and Saudi Arabia, financial links.

We'll see how successful Democrats are in getting these from the president.

Kobach rejects the notion that his Senate race would be a repeat of the 2018 contest for governor, noting that while Democrats have long been competitive for state races, they haven't won a Senate race since 1932. He says that while Kelly attacked him over funding for public schools, for instance, the issue set will be different during this presidential election cycle.

Look, I meant what I said before. In any criminal investigation, I don't care if it's a drug trafficking conspiracy case, a human trafficking case or the Capitol, all persons will be looked at, Sherwin told NPR. If the evidence leads to any actor that may have had a role in this and if that evidence meets the four corners of a federal charge or a local charge, we're going to pursue it, he said.

And, recognizing that women make up the majority of minimum-wage workers, I'll stop the exploitation of low-wage workers. I'll increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour, support the elimination of the tipped minimum wage, and dismantle the barriers to higher-paying jobs for these workers.

While tax credits help some freelancers -- especially those highly paid ones who tend to take a hit when it's time to pay taxes -- they are essentially too little, too late for many of us. According to the Freelancing in America report , the median hourly rate among freelancers overall is $20/hour (gross annual salary of $41,600), while for skilled freelancers, it's $28/hour ($58,240/year). In other words, most freelancers don't have much in the way of a rainy day fund. In addition, many freelancers file their taxes annually rather than quarterly, which means that they wouldn't see the aid from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act until spring 2021.

Here's your cheat sheet to get you up to speed on the news that could affect your wallet.
Getting your personal information can help a scammer engage in identity theft -- filing a tax return in your name and collecting a refund. The IRS is aware of and has been tackling this problem, and in fiscal year 2015, it initiated 776 identity theft related investigations, resulting in 774 sentencings. Working behind the scenes, in the first nine months of 2016, it reduced the number of people who filed affidavits with the IRS saying they were victims of identity theft by almost half, compared to 2015 -- with affadavits dropping from 512,278 to 237,750. Still, be warned and be wary.
Apparently, the contrast was clear to MLK's son as well, who spoke out on his father's national holiday, saying: Now, Martin Luther King Jr. was a bridge builder, not a wall builder.

Some businesses, like Missouri-based Cap America, have had to start paying a 10% tariff on a majority of their inventory because it comes from China. The company made most of their baseball caps in-house (and was appropriately named) until 2001, but it became cheaper to buy them from China. Now, about 89% of the caps sold in the United States comes from China. Cap America then embroiders them here.
Likewise, we are restoring our Nation's manufacturing might, even though predictions were that this could never be done. After losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my Administration with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or built. We have created over half a million new manufacturing jobs. Companies are not leaving; they are coming back. Everybody wants to be where the action is, and the United States of America is, indeed, where the action is.

The national debt has been rising at an accelerated rate in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when Congress and the Obama administration approved stimulus funding in order to keep the economy afloat.
JENNINGS: Without the president's support, no legislation would be signed into law, if that's what you're looking for. But that doesn't mean the free market can't continue to innovate. Another core issue here is, will consumers demand more environmentally friendly technologies, will they demand more electric cars, for instance. So I think there's two ends to this. There's the government response, but then there is also will the market respond to consumers if they make it a priority in their own spending.
There's a long waiting list for all of the key malls in the country, Kosutic continues. We have a large number of new malls being opened this year, next year, so the real estate supply pipeline keeps on being strong.
The picture improves dramatically, however, if you continue to work and save beyond age 65. For example, save 15% a year and work until you're 70, and you could be looking at a nest egg of roughly $290,000. Save at a 20%-a-year rate, and you're talking about entering retirement with roughly $345,000 in savings.

One of the least covered but most important aspects of the Trump presidency is how he, unlike every president that has come before him, simply does not believe in the coalition built in the aftermath of Word War II.
Would you—and how would you—propose to strengthen protection for people who need accommodations to do their jobs while pregnant or who are discriminated against because of their pregnancies at work?
This was an incredible moment. Paired with awarding the girl a scholarship and giving Rush Limbaugh a medal right there in the House chamber, it's clear that Trump is bringing a reality TV flair to the State of the Union address.
MARGARET CARLSON, CAPITAL GANG: Sandra Day O'Connor said that equal protection means that you cannot have a law that applies differently to heterosexuals and homosexuals. So she does follow the Constitution in that regard.
Even Prince Harry and Meghan Markle seem to understand the contrast their wedding offers to reality today, choosing a more modest celebration, relatively speaking. And yet, are they doing us a disservice? As long as we're indulging in fantasy, why skimp? We continue to give tax breaks to the rich, while threatening to slash funding for health care, food stamps and public education.
For example, during the 2020 election cycle the American Bankers Association and the National Association of Realtors donated about $1.3 million apiece to those Republicans, according to OpenSecrets.

There is no doubt that rational reforms should have been a priority in Albany -- and around the nation, as well. But there needs to be additional consultation with police, prosecutors and judges on these alarming results. Consideration needs be given to afford judicial discretion, as applied to each individual case before the bench -- bereft of blanket mandates that leave judges helpless but to comply with some risky restrictions.

Trump's defense strategy was headlined by efforts to push the US to exit foreign wars. And his foreign affairs strategy was dominated by his belief that the US was being taken advantage of by other nations, including allies.
And so there are a couple of things that I would just add to what Senator Clinton said.
It's important to note that the economy has been expanding for a decade, starting under President Barack Obama. And the rate of growth is not any greater for Trump. But in his telling, he is to thank for it all. More jobs were created in the end of Obama's last term than in the beginning of Trump's. But he doesn't provide that nuance.
No one in New York had a clue what I was talking about, Pierce said. I'm the only person from Delaware most of my friends here have ever met, and they know absolutely nothing about the state.

OBAMA: I've met a young woman who gets three hours of sleep a night because she has to work the night shift even as she's going to school full time, and still can't afford to provide the health care for her sister who's ill.
BITTERMANN: There is some, Christi. In fact, President Macron said that he is going to address the situation on Tuesday. We're not sure what he is going to do. I would suspect there might be a decrease in the gas tax announced or something like that, but he doesn't have a whole lot of room to maneuver here, given the economy in France and that sort of thing. And he's also been very resolute about saying that he is going to carry out government reforms. Some of the protesters today, for example, are against the reforms he announced from the first days in his office, the reforms to the labor laws in this country. He said that's what we have to do to get the economy moving here. That was met very positively by a lot of businessmen in the country, but now two years after those reforms were announced, in fact this is what we are having on the streets as people feel the bite of the reforms and the high taxes and whatnot. Christi?
The average 401(k) loan, by contrast, usually charges an interest rate a percentage point or two above the prime rate — currently at 4.5%, so assume 6% or so. Even though withdrawing the money means you miss out on the potential compounding of that money in the stock market — historically speaking, between 6% and 7% after inflation — you can see that it's basically a wash between slowly chipping away at a credit card at 12.5% APR versus paying it off in one fell swoop with a 401(k) loan. Plus, the interest you pay on your 401(k) loan is deposited into your 401(k) — so at least those interest payments are going to you and not the bank.

Loosen the age-band so insurers can charge older folks more. Under Obamacare, insurers could only charge older enrollees three times more than younger policy holders. The GOP bill would widen that band to five-to-one, which would hike premiums for those in their 50s and early 60s, but reduce them for younger folks.

The two Republicans' attempts to damage Cruz reflect their campaigns' understanding that their best bet at a long-shot run depends on a strong finish in Iowa – and that Cruz's strength in Iowa makes that unlikely. Whether or not the attacks help Santorum or Huckabee, though, they could hurt Cruz enough to widen the lane for middle-tier candidates such as Rubio and Christie.

Because the problem is, if we think that meeting with the president is a privilege that has to be earned, I think that reinforces the sense that we stand above the rest of the world at this point in time. And I think that it's important for us in undoing the damage that has been done over the last seven years, for the president to be willing to take that extra step.
One of the worst things you can do with a 401(k) account is not use it -- or underuse it. There are more than 600,000 defined contribution plans such as 401(k)s in existence, with more than 70 million people participating in them. As of late 2016, there was about $7 trillion in 401(k) plans.
Reduce the income threshold for deducting medical expenses. Under the GOP bill, taxpayers would be able to deduct medical expenses that exceed 5.8% of their adjusted gross income. Obamacare had raised the threshold to 10%. This would begin in 2017.

And that's as policy that I'm going to change when I'm president of the United States.

There's a long precedent of not prosecuting former presidents over policy differences, said Elliot Williams, a CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor. The difference is we're not talking about policy difference here, and this is perhaps the most egregious conduct we've ever seen from a president while in office.

Historians say that there's any numbers of ways that Trump shattered norms of the American presidency and politics, but Belmonte is not convinced much of Trump's legacy will be terribly enduring. She argued that Trump lacks a signature legislative achievement comparable to Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act or George W. Bush's No Child Left Behind Act.
He had also talked about how Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a brilliant and bright woman. But he just doesn't think that the party has gone that far left, as you have heard him also say.

GOLDBERG: I made that comment about Sandy Hook just because of the terribleness of young elementary school kids being shot, and the fact that none of them made it to the hospital, which told me as a trauma surgeon how devastating those wounds were. And as I said, I sometimes believe that what America season their TVs is really a sanitized version. The pictures that we see are the Facebook pictures of the victims. And instead I think there was a teachable moment, not being disrespectful at all, but we had a teachable moment to show what those guns and what the gun did to all those kids. And we should have had a moment to show those autopsy photos if the parents had given their permission. I think this would have made a huge change in the debate we have now.
The bill would affect new teachers and move them to a hybrid cash-balance plan rather than traditional pensions, and would limit new sick days that teachers can put toward their retirement.

Lifestyle planning can also help with the financial side of preparing for your early retirement, as the way you live in retirement can directly affect how much you'll spend and thus how large a nest egg you'll require. So as you're working on your retirement budget and gauging how much you need to save, you'll want to think about such issues as whether you plan to travel a lot or stick close to home and whether you intend to remain in your current house or downsize to smaller, less expensive digs in an effort to free up home equity and lower housing costs.

The threat of legal action and disbarment from public office in the future still looms. But the President already has suffered the most painful penalty of all: Fred Trump's boy will go home a loser.
A: We have such a complicated relationship with corporate politics. We criticize corporations for spending money on elections in the wake of Citizens United. At the same time, we celebrate Dick's Sporting Goods when they announce they're not going to sell guns to people under the age of 21. Or we complement a private company that says we won't do business with North Carolina because they're discriminating against transgender people.
But the truth is that we as Democrats have not had a working majority in a very long time. And what I mean by that is a working majority that could push through the kinds of bold initiatives that all of us have proposed.

In 2018, Trump touted the success of his new tax cuts, calling them the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history and claiming they would be a boon to the economy. However, a combination of the reduced revenues due to the tax cuts and record-setting defense spending helped balloon the federal budget deficit to $1 trillion last year. More recently, the President has said he is considering cuts to entitlement programs as a means of debt reduction.
Clearly, there are other topics you'll have to address as you prepare to make your early exit. You'll want to be sure you're following a consistent investing strategy that jibes with your tolerance for risk, balances growth and downside protection and keeps expenses to a minimum. If you won't have enough savings in taxable accounts to fund the initial years of your retirement, then you'll also want to look into ways of tapping tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA while avoiding or minimizing early-withdrawal penalties. And you'll want to monitor your progress as you near your planned retirement date to gauge whether leaving your job at 55 is still realistic or whether you might be better off delaying a year or two.

Yet diseases can be far more damaging than natural disasters such as hurricanes or a tsunami, or other unpredictable events known as black swans. According to a study by the World Bank, a severe pandemic could cause economic losses equal to nearly 5% of global GDP, or more than $3 trillion. Losses from a weaker flu pandemic, such as the 2009 H1N1 virus, can still wipe 0.5% off global GDP.

Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies have agreed to restore diplomatic relations with the tiny gas-rich nation of Qatar . The agreement ends a three-year boycott of the nation that has divided the Gulf states ever since. In 2017, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt accused Qatar of supporting terrorism and took issue with the country's friendly relations with Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood. Under the boycott, Qatar's only land border -- with Saudi Arabia -- was sealed shut, and boycotting nations closed their airspace to Qatar. Though the countries' leaders appeared optimistic at the signing of the deal in the Saudi city of al-Ula, it's unclear what provisions it entails and which have been met.

These proposals would raid the Medicare benefits our seniors depend on, while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration. This is what is happening in California and other States -- their systems are totally out of control, costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money. If forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left. But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free Government healthcare for illegal aliens!

Trump's efforts to overhaul the global trading system has already strained some business owners and farmers.

Trump is expected to unfurl a new list of pardons, including for white-collar criminals and celebrity rappers, in his last full day in office Tuesday that is likely to reflect the self-dealing contempt for justice that was a dominant theme of his tumultuous term.

The first action that ended the consensus was profoundly moral. Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson both backed the Civil Rights Movement's call to dismantle America's racist policies, including the segregation of housing, schools and places of public accommodation, and the systemic denial of voting rights to African Americans, which had prevailed since the end of Reconstruction.

(If you think your total taxes due will be around $15,000 and $12,000 was withheld by your employer, you would send in the difference, $3,000.)

After not winning there (this year), I had to ask myself if we could make this thing work, he said Thursday. With reluctance, I had to decide that the opportunity did just not appear to be there. To stay in the race any longer, Forbes continued, would be to do damage to the party, because (the press) would focus on things like, 'when is he going to get out.'
Kelton: The brake is inflation. If policymakers run wild, cutting taxes and pumping money into the economy with reckless abandon, inflation will spike and voters will (presumably) check those politicians at the ballot box. So, in a sense, democracy is the thing that keeps politicians in check. But that doesn't mean we can't pass Medicare-for-All or make public colleges and universities tuition-free, even with the tax cuts in place. The debt is not the constraining factor (except, perhaps, politically). The point is this: the economic constraint is inflation.

Women need to feel safe no matter what. No matter where they are—at home, at school, at work, and in their communities. I have spent my entire career fighting for women's safety, starting in 1990, when I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. At the time, domestic violence was considered a private family matter. Because of that landmark legislation, and countless survivors who have spoken out, that is no longer the case today. Women who face violence at home or on campus know that they are not alone—that they have a way forward.

In a situation like Covid-19 that requires a robust government response, the federal, state and local governments need to be better coordinated —both vertically and horizontally.

A good response necessitates cooperation from the public. Self-quarantines seem hard, but they are necessary. And no matter how monotonous constantly washing your hands with soap and water may seem, remember it could save your life.

In that example, you wouldn't get anything extra from your employer for anything you contribute above 6%, but you'd still get the tax benefits. Anyway, bottom line: At the very least, if at all possible, make sure you max out your employer match. Think about it this way: If you make $50,000 a year and contribute 6% for a 50% employer match, you're putting in $3,000 annually -- and your employer pays you an extra $1,500 in your 401(k) as a thank-you for doing that. That's a nice chunk of change.

Rather, arrange for a portion of each paycheck to filter directly into savings, and forget it exists. You can set up an automatic transfer with your bank so that part of your earnings land in a savings account.

The status quo is that Republicans promised strong growth kickstarted by the tax cuts they passed without Democratic help would help pay for the tax cuts themselves. That's a question mark in any case, but it will only really work with so-called entitlement reform to curb the growth in spending of Medicare and Social Security. They passed the tax cuts – the easy part – without addressing the spending, the hard part.

Trade tensions still loom over the economy and markets, too. The Trump administration is threatening to raise tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods if China fails to meet US demands on a variety of economic and political issues.

Let's say you want to increase your net worth by $200,000 and you've decided to set a timeframe of 15 years. For the purposes of this example, you have $5,000 of credit card debt at 18% interest but other than that, your only debt is a low-interest mortgage. The first step in the plan would be to get rid of the credit card debt, and you decide that your goal is to pay it off within one year. You fire up a debt calculator and discover that if you pay an extra $400 per month on your credit card over and above the minimum payment, you'll have it paid off in 11 months. You scrape together the extra $400 by cutting back on expenses, and get it paid off on schedule (don't forget to reward yourself for reaching your first goal!).

But now his monument is caught between his own grand vision and Democratic priorities for immigration reform, not to mention his party's far right. Trump probably longs for the good old days, when he could – and would – say just about anything in a room to test a real estate deal, especially since his company was not publicly held. Exaggeration was king, a perfect fit for Trump. Alan Pomerantz, who represented a group of Trump's creditors in the early 1990s, calls it puffing. Trump probably perfected the art of the hype.

Provide refundable tax credits based on age and income instead. The Republicans want to issue advanceable refundable tax credits to help people afford coverage on the individual market, but these credits will be based mainly on a person's age. The credits will range from $2,000 for 20-somethings to $4,000 for those in their early 60s. The credits will also have an income cap. Those making more than $75,000 would see their tax credits start to phase out, and an enrollee making more than $215,000 would no longer be eligible. Families with incomes above $150,000 would see their credits dwindle, while those earning more than $290,000 would no longer qualify. This provision would take effect in 2020.

That couldn't be further from anything he'd possibly consider, he said when he was asked about a tax on Mexican goods. And the White House soon walked back Spicer's remark on Thursday.

Another good option for lowering your taxes is taking advantage of the medical expense deduction. Currently, you can deduct out-of-pocket medical costs that exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income (AGI). This means that if you spend $10,000 a year on healthcare and have an AGI of $60,000, you can deduct any amount above $6,000 -- which, in this case, is $4,000. Since medical care is the one expense that tends to universally go up among seniors, it pays to track your spending and keep impeccable records so that you know what sort of deduction to claim.

There's still more than a week left in his term, and he still has command of the military. Recognizing Trump's impetuous, vindictive nature and his deranged belief that he won the presidential election, the 10 living former defense secretaries cosigned an unprecedented op-ed in the Washington Post on Sunday , writing, Efforts to involve the US armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory. Trump is vastly unfit to serve in the role of President. The 25th Amendment is there for moments like these.
Facts First: Sanders is right, but this needs context. Sanders voted for a bill that would have bailed out the auto industry -- but it failed to pass the Senate. He voted against a different bailout measure, the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, which passed. That program released money to banks -- and a portion of that money eventually went to automakers.

Now, its request to access and to share sensitive evidence in the case among Russians gets to what prosecutors believe is the heart of its strategy.

But again, this option is far from ideal, because any time you remove money from an IRA, that's less income you'll have available in retirement. Furthermore, it's not just that principal amount you're losing out on during your golden years, but the growth it could've achieved over time.

On another culture war front, the administration also withdrew Obama-era protections for transgender students in public schools. And in his final year in office, as Black Americans protested police brutality in widespread protests, Trump issued a salvo against attempts to more accurately portray racism and slavery in school history including creating the 1776 Commission to promote patriotic education. But with Trump's presidency coming to an end, it's unlikely to have an impact on future US curriculums.
Like much of Trump's presidency, the event felt entirely free-form – as if Trump was making all of it up as he went.

President-elect Trump has about 4,000 government positions to fill, including some of the most important posts in the US government.

It's hard to talk here about a just transition for fossil fuel workers -- as if any transition for workers in dying US industries ever has been just.

For 10 years, I've studied terrorist deradicalization initiatives around the world. I've visited programs in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Singapore and elsewhere.

OBAMA: As I indicated earlier, one of the things that I did last year was to pass a bill with Tom Coburn, very conservative Republican but a sincere fiscal conservative. And we got together and created what we call Google for Government. It's a searchable database, where every single dollar of federal spending is posted on the Internet, so that ordinary voters can take a look.

The attack on the Capitol, Brownell said, with the encouragement and direction of President Trump, was shocking and unprecedented.

It will also be interesting to see whether Trump's new outline will call for tax breaks to help families with child care costs. Late in the campaign he proposed two, but an independent analysis found that such breaks -- coupled with a few other of Trump's tax proposals -- could unintentionally raise taxes on millions of low- to middle-income families.

The impacts of the shutdown vary by department and agency, and there is no central database of stop work orders from agencies to contractors or how many affected contractors are impacted by those orders. The impact of the shutdown also changes as the shutdown continues because some work that could continue originally with other funds may no longer be able to do so, according to a PSC spokesperson.

He presided over the first criminal justice reform in years. And he managed to avoid being drawn into foreign wars and beefed up US policy toward an increasingly hostile China while putting NATO nations on notice they must spend more in their own defense. At the same time, he trashed America's reputation among its friends abroad, treated another looming threat -- climate change -- with the same denial he brought to the coronavirus and fawned over autocratic US enemies such as Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un

You won't actually need the money for decades, so it won't matter if your portfolio tanks in value this year; it'll likely rebound in the next. That can lead to some pretty heart-palpitating moments as your investments see-saw up and down, but just grit your teeth and remind yourself that it doesn't matter how much those stocks are worth today; what matters is how much they'll be worth when you approach retirement.
Additionally, high-profile criminal cases such as those involving tax write-offs would be unlikely either to bring the country together or shed enough light on what occurred over the previous four years.

CAMEROTA: It's a round trip ride we give you.
The first of these seems unlikely to happen. It might require a broader deal -- if he were willing, Vice President Mike Pence could convince both Trump and the cabinet to remove the President in return for a full pardon from President Pence. It would be a risky move for Pence's future given the negative reception former President Gerald Ford received for pardoning Richard Nixon. And that kind of deal depends on Trump's emotional state and whether or not he believes he can pardon himself.
Trump did not disclose his tax returns during the presidential campaign despite the widespread precedent of modern candidates to do so.

The next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. Yet, for too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools. To rescue these students, 18 States have created school choice in the form of Opportunity Scholarships. The programs are so popular, that tens of thousands of students remain on waiting lists. One of those students is Janiyah Davis, a fourth grader from Philadelphia. Janiyah's mom Stephanie is a single parent. She would do anything to give her daughter a better future. But last year, that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania's Governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice for 50,000 children.

How to fix it: Health insurance is a financial necessity these days; virtually no one can pay such high healthcare costs unassisted.

Days later, the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence. He viciously shot one man going about his daily work; he approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and the chest. He walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon.

So there you have it: You don't need to go through the hassle of itemizing on your tax return to claim a number of potentially lucrative deductions. And that means you could end up saving two valuable things this tax season: your money and your time.
Repealing Obamacare and replacing it with something something terrific? That's up in the air. His first attempt failed in March when he couldn't gin up enough votes in Congress. Many business leaders hoped Trump would move on to tax cuts, but Trump surprised many by telling Fox Business on Tuesday, I have to do healthcare first. Now, confusion abounds on what the next priority is.
Democratic Rep. John Sarbanes of Maryland told reporters that the bill was intended to set the table on what Democratic priorities in the new Congress look like even if Majority Leader Mitch McConnell won't take them up in the Senate.

We had not planned on that in Georgia, not necessarily foreseeing that we would be interacting with a lot of Spanish-speaking, pro-life voters, but as it turns out, we are, Dannenfelser said, adding that we want to meet people where they are.

Inaccurate. He knows the truth, I know the truth, others know the truth, and here is the truth: The people of the United States of America, people of the world, don't believe what he is saying, Cohen said. The man doesn't tell the truth. And it is sad that I should take responsibility for his dirty deeds.
We've got people who are struggling, working two or three jobs to put food on the table. What's going to happen to them? Sanders said.

Facebook (FB) is the latest tech giant to report extremely strong earnings for the fourth quarter. While the stock is flat Thursday, it is already up 16% this year.
This choice is false. The only way we can move forward and restore rule of law is by having some kind of process to document what occurred during the Trump era, how it culminated in violence that left five dead and ensuring that it has consequences for those responsible.
BROWN: Senator Obama, in the same vein, you were also opposed to the surge from the beginning. Were you wrong?
And this, despite the fact that Britain has responded to tough economic times by resorting to fiscal austerity – such that according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the UK's budget today is effectively the same as it was 10 years ago. According to the Independent, The major report from the UK's leading economic think tank shows that deep cuts have left the [National Health Service], schools and prisons in a 'fragile state', and have merely returned public spending to pre-financial crisis levels.
Fewer new cars sales back then means there are fewer used cars to sell now.
But I think that what we want to do is have a little reality check here, because how is it best to end poverty? We know we've got to maintain programs that are there to help people in need, but look at what's happened over the space of the last seven years. The average African American family has lost $2,600 in income.
While more Saudi women are entering the private sector, the challenge is persuading them to stay there.
His proposal to give companies a one-time tax break to bring back -- or repatriate -- cash that is currently being held overseas could give tech companies more ammo to increase hiring, acquire companies, boost dividends and buy back more stock.
It might be best to establish one large commission to look into the entire administration. Another approach would be to establish several smaller commissions. There might, for example, be one on the January 6 insurrection, one focusing on the administration's catastrophic mishandling of the Covid-19 crisis, one on allegations of corruption in the Trump administration and perhaps others as well.
WALSH: Well, I do think that they are probably unhelpful. There's been a lot of talk about destabilizing Iran, having American- made solutions to the Iranian problem. And I think that's counterproductive, because what it does, it strengthens the hand of the hard-liners, the folks we want to lose here, it actually helps them.
One solution is to create large supplements to the Pell Grant to help students without local college access.
And there are some tax implications. Unlike a 529 college savings plan, this is not a tax-deferred account. The first $1,050 of income, or capital gains, from the account is not taxed annually. After that, it's taxed at the child's rate. Any amount over $2,100 may be taxed at the custodian's higher individual income tax rate, according to the IRS.
Facts First: This was a major exaggeration. While Trump's administration has invested in new military planes, it is not even close to true that the US military has new everything or that the old planes are all gone now.
You know, she's making a point, and I think I should have the opportunity to respond very briefly. And I'll try to make...
I think we should reach out to Republicans if they choose not to come on board, which I suspect will probably be the case ... we should use that majority in a very aggressive way, Sanders said. It is my view we should make sure that we address the needs of the American people in that reconciliation bill, and if we pass it with 51 votes, we'll pass it with 51 votes.
Medical personnel move a deceased patient to a refrigerated truck serving as make shift morgues at Brooklyn Hospital Center on April 9, 2020 in New York City.
During my campaign, people told me to fix the damn roads -- because blown tires and broken windshields are downright dangerous. And car repairs take money from rent, child care, or groceries.
SAVIDGE: It was something to behold. It was neck in neck all the way, and it took about four extra holes, 22 in all to get to a winner. Darkness was setting in. In the end, Mickelson edged out his longtime rival, earning $9 million prize money, and a fortune in bragging rights. Not bad. PAUL: Amanda Boxtel was a dancer and avid skier. All of that changed
The changes would last for a year, but lawmakers would then push to make them permanent, another Democratic aide said.
For those looking for something a little safer, Green recommends shorter maturity bonds or a short-term bond exchange traded fund. A shorter duration means less credit risk and less interest rate risk. And those are both good things in a rising interest rate market.
Answering that question begins with knowing what we don't need to build. America already has too much infrastructure that we don't maintain adequately, or which we don't use to its fullest potential. Research indicates that fixing existing roads, for example, delivers greater return on investment than expanding them. We don't need new pipelines to distribute even more dangerous fossil fuels nearly as much as we need to fix existing pipeline leaks.

The average homeowner spends 1% to 4% of his or her home's value on annual maintenance and repairs, but if you trade in your current home for a smaller one, you might slash your expenses in half. After all, it's cheaper to heat and cool a 1,500-square-foot house than a home twice that size, and maintaining a modest backyard is far easier than mowing and trimming a much larger property.

The town may be small but it's wealthy, thanks to the clean hydroelectric energy it sells to Italy's state.
Then there are savings accounts, which not only impose taxes on interest income but offer very little in the way of returns to begin with. These days, you'll be lucky to get a solid 1% per year out of your savings account, making it a rather inefficient tool.
And what Buttigieg is doing here is tapping into this idea that we can think big, Obama-like; we can change the system. We don't have to do it incrementally. And he's doing it in a language that young people understand, and they feel an affinity.

CLINTON: But the fact is that the purpose of it has not been fulfilled.

HUNT: And I want to tell you one more thing too...
I do think we are moving into a world where corporations are gaining more power, and gaining more rights that are troublesome: rights of political speech, rights of religious liberty to give them exemption from generally applicable laws.

5. Letting your emotions control your decisions
You might think you don't have much leeway when it comes to saving money each month, but if you're willing to take a long, hard look at your budget, you'll probably come to find that there are some expenses you can manage to cut, whether it's the cable plan you can afford to downgrade or those daily lunches you know you can prepare yourself. Reworking your budget is apt to get you closer to your goal of buying a home, so comb through your expenses line by line and figure out which are less important to you. Then, pledge to reduce or eliminate those spending categories and bank the difference.

If you overdraw your account, the interest you're charged on the loan is likely to be lower than that on a bank overdraft. In many instances, too, the interest may be characterized as margin interest, which can be tax-deductible.

What I do want to focus on, though, is how important it is, when you talked about taking on the Republicans, how important it is I think to redraw the political map in this country. And the reason I say that is that we have gone through the 2000 election, the 2004 election, both of which were disappointing elections.
Two years ago, we were able to get a bill out of the Senate. I was one of the group of senators that helped to move it through, but it died in the House this year. Because it was used as a political football instead of a way of solving a problem, nothing happened.

Biden is looking to eliminate private dollars from federal elections through a constitutional amendment, according to his website, which would require candidates to rely on public dollars alone for their campaigns.

Trump's political career began with outrageous lies and a conspiracy theory over former President Barack Obama's birthplace. It is ending, at least for now, with another even more outrageous one: the false claim that he won an election he clearly lost. Trump's perpetuating of this alternative reality has caused catastrophic damage to faith in government that is the bedrock of any functioning nation. His shattering of the tradition of peaceful US transfers of power threatens to suffocate Biden's legitimacy and prolong the nation's agony at a time of dire crises.

But I'll tell you what the Chinese are doing, and it's going to be a demographic catastrophe.

The House and the Senate will meet today to formally count the Electoral College votes from the 2020 presidential election. But what is usually a routine part of American democracy could turn ugly because of President Trump and his most ardent supporters' ongoing refusal to accept the results. Here's what will happen : Some Republicans in both chambers have pledged to object to some results, which are counted state-by-state, meaning there may be debate when certain states come up. All objections will be voted on -- and are expected to fail. So in the end, GOP objections will most likely serve as a marker of loyalty to the President, rather than actually affect the results. They could also cast a shadow over future democratic processes and maintain the seed of doubt among Trump supporters who believe his false claims that the election was stolen from him. We could also see unrest, as Trump has encouraged supporters to come to the Capitol as the votes are counted.
The populations of places with super-low unemployment tend to be very white.

For now, though, Trump is dead-set on keeping a party that has indulged him, enabled him and been enabled by him at every pass onside for one more battle. The results of those efforts, though, have been uneven. The decision to dash his veto of this year's National Defense Authorization Act, which Trump opposed because it didn't strike legal protections for social media companies and included a provision to rename military bases named after Confederate leaders, marked the first time during Trump's presidency that Republicans openly and materially rejected his desires.

I was proud to fight for the Family and Medical Leave Act, landmark legislation that created important workplace protections and granted 12 weeks of [unpaid] leave to working families. But we need to go further—I believe the United States should guarantee 12 weeks of paid sick and family leave for workers.

The bottom line: The divide you are seeing rip through the Republican Party right now isn't between conservatives and moderates. This isn't the Freedom Caucus vs. leadership. It's not even as simple as members who might run for President in 2024 vs. those who will not. What you are seeing right now is a gamble members are taking on whether the GOP can finally shake Trump going forward or whether there is no way to win the White House again without him on their side.

A US Navy investigation into the incident concluded that the sailors were 1.5 nautical miles from Iran's Farsi Island, clearly within Iranian waters. It was reasonable for Iran to investigate the unusual appearance of armed U.S. Naval vessels within territorial waters so close to its shores, the investigation concluded . (The investigation also faulted Iran for its handling of the incident, but its criticism of Iran was not at all about where the sailors were located.) An illustrated map released by the US Navy also makes clear that the sailors were not mere feet from that line when they were stopped by Iran. Iranian and US officials told media outlets at the time that Iran's territorial waters extend 12 nautical miles from the island, a standard distance

So most low-income homeowners are paying for a tax benefit that only a few will receive. The overwhelming majority of homeowners whose household income is $40,000 or less do not receive any tax benefit from mortgage interest payments. Once income hits $50,000, then the majority of homeowners do receive tax benefits. Clearly, tax benefits for the mortgage interest deduction are flowing to middle and upper income taxpayers.

Second, high-income households have enjoyed skyrocketing incomes over the past 40 years, but their average tax rates have remained relatively constant. From 1979 to 2015, average market income for those in the top 1% rose by 233%, from $552,000 to $1.84 million (in 2015 dollars). But federal taxes as a share of their income have fallen — from 35% in 1979 to 33% in 2015 — and the 2017 tax cuts reduced them further. In a progressive system like ours, the tax share of income should rise as income rises. High-income households are due for a significant increase in tax burdens.

At each state, the vice president, in his role as the president of the Senate, will call to ask if there are any objections. If there is an objection it will have to come from one senator and one member of the House and be turned over in writing. At that point, the joint session breaks up, and both chambers debate separately for up to two hours. They will then vote on the objection and resume the joint session.
This can be sped up if there is agreement: The entire process, for example, took just 40 minutes in 2017.

Your workplace retirement plan (whether 401(k), 403(b), TSP, etc.) comes with specific tax benefits. If it's a traditional 401(k) (or equivalent plan), you get to reduce your taxable income by a dollar for every dollar you put in.

In the Manhattan US Attorney's case against Cohen, he pleaded guilty to five counts of tax fraud related to his taxi-medallion business. Cohen's taxi business was linked closely to his family members, including his father-in-law, Fima Shusterman, from whom Cohen bought some medallions, CNN previously reported. Shusterman, who emigrated from Ukraine, pleaded guilty in 1993 to a financial crime relating to the taxi business, according to court records.
But I said before, I think she did it in the wrong way, because it wasn't just the fact that the insurance companies, the drug companies were battling here, and no doubt they were.

It also tells us that the courts, as subject to elite opinion, as fellow elites in the culture, the public really doesn't like racial preferences. They support affirmative action, but not race preferences, although the elites do. And they, of course, upheld race preferences in the Michigan case, not affirmative action. And it also says that if something becomes controversial, like the antisodomy laws, they'll change their precedent, in just 17 years ago. They're not content to leave that to the democratic process. People have changed their minds, which is why only 13 states have such laws, and they're largely unenforced. But they want to jump into that kind of democratic wrangling with a tough issue and preempt the public's action.

The truth here is that congressional Republicans threw their lot in with Trump – totally and completely – shortly after he won the White House.

But can tweaking the flawed laws make a difference? Rafael A. Mangual, the deputy director of legal policy at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, argued in an op-ed that New Jersey has enacted similar reforms, but with a bit more prudence. He highlighted one important distinction where prosecutors in New Jersey can move to revoke a defendant's release if that defendant is rearrested for a new offense, or if he fails to appear in court. Garden State judges granted more than 1,000 such motions in 2018. But even while crediting New Jersey for a more effective reformation, Mangual notes it remains less than ideal, acknowledging that [t]he most recent report issued by the state's judiciary shows a not-insignificant increase in the percentage of defendants charged with new offenses while awaiting trial.

Still, despite freelancers' inclusion in the stimulus package, for freelancers like me in California, this extension of benefits is coming at a time when many of our careers have already been upended by AB5. This California law mandates the reclassification of certain workers formerly classified as independent contractors so that they're considered waged employees. But there are many self-employed people who aren't gig workers who work for one or two rideshare companies. Many of us are freelancers who provide services -- without key employment protections -- for dozens of entities per year, and we don't meet the standard to be reclassified as employees, nor do many freelancers want to be reclassified.
If we have to shift a large portion of our inventory to American-made cheeses, then we'd be just like every other supermarket. That's not what people travel to Di Palo's for, he said.
Every case will differ in terms of how you'd fare overall. But just as one example: A single freelancer making $70,000 could pay $1,100 more in total federal tax (income + payroll) this year than someone making $70,000 as an employee, according to The Tax Institute at H&R Block.
Their unrealistic expectation makes some sense. After all, scientists had just pulled a once-in-a-century sort of rabbit from their hat, producing a seemingly first-rate pair of vaccines in record time with, up to now, very little evidence of concerning side effects. After doing the impossible once, many assumed that a second longshot would hit the mark as well and a flawless vaccine implementation program would magically appear.

The timetable for when the US will pull troops out of Syria is still up in the air. President Trump, when he made the surprise announcement last month, indicated he wanted the 2,000 troops brought home quickly. But national security adviser John Bolton says troops won't leave until the US can be assured that Turkey won't attack Kurdish allies there. The Kurds have helped the US fight ISIS, but Turkey considers some Kurdish groups to be terrorists. Bolton said the President wants guarantees from Turkey that it will protect Kurdish fighters. In case you've forgotten, here's a head-spinning chart of who is fighting whom in Syria.

I also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China's massive theft of American jobs. Our strategy worked. Days ago, we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions of dollars into our treasury, and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the United States of America. For decades, China has taken advantage of the United States, now we have changed that but, at the same time, we have perhaps the best relationship we have ever had with China, including with President Xi. They respect what we have done because, quite frankly, they could never believe what they were able to get away with year after year, decade after decade, without someone in our country stepping up and saying: Enough. Now, we want to rebuild our country, and that is what we are doing.

The cost of the Mueller investigation
A deduction reduces your taxable income. Have gross income of $70,000 and a $4,000 deduction? Your taxable income is now $66,000. If you're in the 25% tax bracket, you avoid being taxed on that $4,000 and save $1,000. If you have taxable income of $70,000 and a $4,000 tax credit, however, the credit reduces your tax dollar-for-dollar. It's worth a full $4,000.

After more than 500 horrifying days of captivity, Al-Baghdadi murdered young Kayla. She was just 26 years old.

Why should the rich pay more than they already do? First, we need the money, and higher taxes are the only way to get wealthy Americans to bear non-trivial amounts of the fiscal burden. Currently, the economy is at full employment, but the government is running substantial deficits. Low revenues are a big part of the problem; they do not come close to funding current spending. As an aging population pushes up Social Security and Medicare spending in the future, both projected deficits and the need for higher revenues will increase, even if policymakers cut spending somewhat.

Kelton: Few people understand what the national debt is, and most people tend to conflate government deficits with the national debt. So let's start by clarifying these terms. The national debt is nothing more than a historical record of all the dollars that were spent by government but not taxed back. When the government spends more than it collects in the form of taxes (and other payments), we label it deficit spending. But that's only part of the story. To complete the picture, suppose the government spends $100 into the economy but only taxes $90 back out. The result is a surplus equal to $10 that shows up somewhere in the non-government part of the economy. In other words, the government's red ink becomes our black ink. Their deficits are our financial surpluses. So where does the debt come into play? Whenever the government runs a deficit, it sells government bonds called U.S. Treasuries. This is usually referred to as borrowing, but that's actually misleading. What's really happening is that the government is allowing people to trade in their dollars for a bond that pays some interest. A pretty good deal if you happen to be lucky enough to hold some of that $22 trillion.

But Bush took a lead in early returns in Florida, and the news organizations that had called Florida for Gore -- including CNN -- quickly switched it back to a toss-up. Watching the returns with his wife and parents, former President George Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush, the GOP nominee said he was not prepared to concede major Eastern states that exit polls indicated were leaning to Gore -- including Pennsylvania and Florida. Both states are led by Republican governors, including the nominee's brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The networks are calling this thing awfully early, but the people counting the votes have a different perspective, the Texas governor said. By 1 a.m., it became clear that both men needed to win Florida to claim the White House -- and about two-thirds of the votes remaining to be counted in Florida came from the Democratic bastions of south Florida, in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas. Late into the night, Gore's deputy campaign manager Mark Fabiani still held out hope of a victory. Bush is slightly ahead now, but that's because the Democratic strongholds in the state -- Dade County and Broward County -- have not had their votes counted yet, Fabiani said. Both campaigns had scrambled to turn out the vote, not only in major states in the Electoral College, but in smaller states where the races were expected to be tight.

But in general, economists have determined that immigrants – undocumented or not – tend to help American workers by serving in low-skilled jobs that create more opportunities for the native born to move into managerial and knowledge-based roles.

This CNBC article lays out some details and highlights the complexity of freelancers' situation: The [Labor Department] guidance should also stipulate if and how gig workers can get benefits for a severe decline in income, rather than outright job loss. Gig workers and contractors are likely to be able to get partial benefits if they don't earn too much. Also, as the article notes, many people who apply for unemployment aren't granted the benefits: approval rates range from a shockingly low 10.5% in North Carolina to over 50% in New Jersey.

(CNN) -- The presidency of the United States hinged on fewer than 1,000 votes in Florida early today, as what may be the closest presidential race in American history kept either Texas Gov. George W. Bush or Vice President Al Gore from declaring victory. The latest CNN vote count gave Bush a lead of only 926 votes in Florida, a margin well within the one-half of one percent that triggers a recount under state law. Gore, meanwhile, led the popular vote nationwide by slightly more than 60,000 votes out of 94 million-plus ballots cast. Shortly after 2 a.m. EST, CNN and other news organizations projected Bush the winner in Florida, with its 25 electoral votes taking his total to 271 -- one more than the 270 needed to win a majority in the Electoral College. But questions about the Florida count prompted the networks to place Florida back in the too close to call category, leaving Bush with only 246. In this story:

You don't have to micromanage your investments -- just learn the basics of asset allocation and tweak your holdings about once a year so they don't get out of wack. If a mutual fund you own is going gangbusters, then it will take up a bigger and bigger percentage of your portfolio. If that mutual fund later tanks, you don't want it to drag your portfolio down with it, so do some occasional buying and selling to keep your investments in check.

He was effective precisely because he inspired the better angels of our nature while calling out injustice without apology.

He was first in his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy. He aspires to go to the Air Force Academy, and then, he has his eye on the Space Force. As Iain says, most people look up at space, I want to look down on the world.
You see, I was still in elementary school, pledging my allegiance to our flag each morning, when I first heard the divisive N-word used as a racial slur. In middle school, when I was taught about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his admirable dream for a unified America through non-violence, I had already been educated outside of school about his broader legacy and the activism that made him a target. So, when white teachers, on the verge of tears, hailed him a hero after reading a few cherry-picked quotes, it wasn't lost on me that it was the government of these purported United States who relentlessly surveilled him and a White man in these United States who murdered him

For some, that is a question about: What should we do about an economy that is at the edge or perhaps in the early stages of a recession? For some, it is more focused.

One vexing problem for Biden is how to convince lawmakers -- and the public -- to add to America's $27 trillion pile of debt. Republicans cast aside their debt concerns to pass the Trump tax cuts and bipartisan spending surges, but deficit hawks are going to make their voices heard again -- as they did during the Obama era.
And these may not be the only taxes you'll pay, either. Social Security benefits won't be taxed if your income is below a certain threshold, but taking 401(k) distributions could push you above that limit, so your benefits become taxable.
The US government willed much of this place into existence.
Analysts had been expecting that the last-minute rush of buyers seeking to get the full tax credit would be a bigger boost to fourth-quarter sales said Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities. But he said the bigger concern was the price cut, which he said came as a complete surprise.

While at US Citizenship and Immigration Services, Mayorkas oversaw the implementation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was an executive action under Obama that protected young undocumented immigrants who had come to the US as children from deportation.

Congress included payments of $1,200 in its initial stimulus when shutdowns because of the coronavirus began last spring.
Trump might perhaps have been referring to his effort to broker a deal between Ethiopia and Egypt in a dispute over a dam Ethiopia is building on the Blue Nile river, a tributary of the Nile. But that dispute had not been resolved at the time of his complaint about the Nobel, so Trump could not have accurately claimed here to have made any successful deal.

So we face big and difficult challenges. And what the American people hope -- what they deserve -- is for all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to work through our differences, to overcome the numbing weight of our politics, for while the people who sent us here have different backgrounds, different stories, different beliefs, the anxieties they face are the same, the aspirations they hold are shared: a job that pays the bills, a chance to get ahead, most of all, the ability to give their children a better life.

The Fed rate hike appears to have been a solution to a nonexistent economic problem. Analysts have defended Powell by saying that the Fed wants to prevent overheating. Huh? Does this mean the Fed is worried that too many Americans are working or that they are earning too much money? If so, that is a very nice compliment to Trump's tax cut and deregulation policies. One thing is for sure: We never had to worry about an overheating economy under President Obama.

It's not like tax reform or trade policy. It's actually concrete (or slats) and there for all the world to see as a Trump achievement. Even when he leaves the Oval Office. And way beyond.
Years of low interest rates and bond buying have left central banks with limited ammunition to deploy, restraining what policymakers can do should the crisis deepen and increasing pressure on individual governments to boost spending.

JENNINGS: Well, I think if we continue to see weather events that are portrayed as being caused by or made more extreme by climate change, that will be more on the minds of voters in 2020. Of course, any of these issues and their impact on an election really depends on if the candidates themselves make it a top priority. My suspicion is this will be a top priority in the Democratic primary for president. The real issue, of course, would be if either candidate makes it a top priority in the general election.
AUSTIN, Texas -- Both the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees chose Texas on Sunday to be the launch pad for their final campaign efforts in the remaining 16 days of the race for the White House. The Republican nominee, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, was in Austin to launch his Brainstorm for Reform tour with 28 other GOP governors. Vice President Al Gore, his Democratic rival, was in Dallas to begin a two-pronged endgame of wooing undecided voters and getting his backers to the polls. Meanwhile, the latest CNN/USA Today/Gallup tracking poll shows Bush is the current preference of 50 percent of likely voters, while Gore is the current preference of 41 percent. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. Interviews with 700 likely voters were conducted from October 19 to 21. While the poll shows Bush maintaining a solid lead over Gore among likely voters, there is plenty of time left in which events can shift voters' current preferences. Nine states, 160 electoral votes I can't think of a better way to kick off the last two weeks of this campaign than stand up with my colleagues, encourage them to go out and invigorate the grass-roots organizations that we have in place all across the country, Bush said in Austin. The Republican governors have scheduled 45 stops in 25 states through Wednesday. Bush will visit nine states this week which carry a total of 160 electoral votes.

One of China's targets was to hit peak emissions  around 2030 . Another target was to get 20% of its energy from sources other than fossil fuels by 2030. That did not mean the accord somehow wouldn't kick in for China until 2030; 2030 was its (self-selected, non-binding) deadline, not a start date . Since the accord came into effect, China has implemented significant new policies to curb its emissions. The Obama administration set a target of reducing US emissions by 26% - 28% below 2005 levels by 2025 . That, similarly, did not mean that the accord would have only kicked in for the US in 2025. (Trump has begun the process of formally withdrawing the US from the accord.)

The later you retire, the longer you can live on earned income and build up your savings, rather than drawing those savings down in order to get by.
In your case, taking Social Security at 70 rather than, say, 65, would boost your Social Security benefit by more than 40%. In fact, you'd probably end up with an even larger increase after also taking into account the extra years of pay you earned (and paid Social Security payroll tax on) during that period. You can see how the combination of saving more and working longer can improve your outlook for retirement by going to this retirement income calculator.

And it seems like Joe Biden, who said during this interview, I am center left, is sort of staking out a clear position and adding some nuance to show that he's not as far left as the rest of the field, that he is basically trying to win over some of those Trump voters by saying, Listen, we're not going to let people die in the streets. We can be compassionate. But not saying that we're going to give a government health -- healthcare plan, government-funded healthcare to undocumented immigrants.

In recent months, we have seen proud Iranians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers. The Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons, stop spreading terror, death, and destruction, and start working for the good of its own people. Because of our powerful sanctions, the Iranian economy is doing very poorly. We can help them make it very good in a short period of time, but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help. We are here. Let's see which road they choose. It is totally up to them.

I think we're transitioning to a weaker economy, but not a real downturn, says economist Ed Leamer, who directs the UCLA/Anderson Business Forecast Project. We're not going to get a collective pullback of spending that would be enough to pull GDP into a negative and kill off the job market. Once the market realizes that, it'll calm down.

But those hopes are already getting undercut by Trump's turbulent first days in office.
McConnell has not spoken to Trump since December, when he acknowledged that Biden had won the election, and the Kentucky Republican has no intention to talk to him again. McConnell's silence over impeachment is purposeful, sending a signal to his conference that is being heard loud and wide that if they want to vote to convict Trump when a trial unfolds in their chamber, they are free to do so. Long gone are the days when McConnell was trying to keep his conference together as they weathered the impeachment trial in 2020. There will be no conversations to try and keep more moderate Republican senators such as Lisa Murkowski of Alaska or Mitt Romney of Utah or anyone else from voting however they want.

And let's face it, in a capitalist system businesses will always be powerful and influential because they bring the material wealth that everyone depends on. That's why we see cities throwing money and tax breaks at corporations to come move there even when the economic benefits are not really crystal clear. So corporations are by necessity pretty powerful.

The department argued that the change would better accommodate religious beliefs of shelter providers, as well as other practical concerns, but it came during the coronavirus pandemic, worrying advocates who feared that it could leave some transgender Americans without housing in the middle of a public health crisis.

When people look at Trump and say, This is not America, they are wrong.
