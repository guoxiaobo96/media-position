And I think the idea of a tariff against Mexico is a terrible idea. I think it would hurt Mexico a lot, and I think it would hurt American consumers as well. We don't need a trade war with Mexico.\n\nThe White House has floated the idea of imposing a 20% tax on imports from Mexico, in order to pay for Trump's proposed southern border wall. However, the White House says Trump is weighing other options.\n\nMoore also said he views Trump's trade policy with China differently.\n\nPHOTO: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images UNITED STATES - AUGUST 31: Stephen Moore of The Heritage Foundation is interviewed by CQ in his Washington office, August 31, 2016. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)\n\nI kind of approve of some of the things he's doing on China, he said. I think he views China as an adversary, and I've come to the conclusion that they are a bit of an adversary militarily, and economically. They're playing a different game economically. They don't play by the rules. They do cheat, they do steal, and I think taking a tougher stance with China is overdue.\n\nMoore also recommended conservative commentator Bill O'Reilly's book on Harry Truman's presidency, Killing the Rising Sun to the President and listeners.\n\nI think people like Trump can learn from Harry Truman, Moore said. He grew in office in an amazing way. And I think the question we all have about Donald Trump, regardless of what our ideology is 'can he grow into this office?\n\nGet CNN's Party People podcast at CNN, Stitcher, TuneInRadio or iTunes.

(CNN) Two of President Donald Trump's Cabinet secretaries -- Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos -- are resigning over the riot Wednesday at the US Capitol.\n\nThe secretaries were among a number of administration officials who announced they were leaving in the wake of a mob of pro-Trump supporters breaching the US Capitol.\n\nIn the statement, addressed to the agency she led, Chao wrote that she will resign effective Monday and was deeply troubled by the entirely avoidable events at the Capitol building\n\nI am tremendously proud of the many accomplishments we were able to achieve together for our country and I will never forget the commitment you have for this Department and the United States of America, her statement continued.\n\nShe added that will help the Transportation Secretary designate, Pete Buttigieg, in taking on the department.\n\nIt has been the honor of a lifetime to serve the U.S. Department of Transportation, she tweeted Thursday.\n\nDeVos submitted a letter of resignation to Trump on Thursday, calling Wednesday's events unconscionable for our country.\n\nThere is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me, she wrote. Impressionable children are watching all of this, and they are learning from us. I believe we each have a moral obligation to exercise good judgement and model the behavior we hope they would emulate. They must know from us that America is greater than what transpired yesterday.\n\nDr. Elinore F. McCance-Katz, assistant secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, also resigned Thursday, writing in her resignation letter that she had planned to stay on until the next administration but her plans abruptly changed Wednesday evening when she saw the violent takeover of the Capitol building.\n\nI believe that this behavior was totally unacceptable and, in my own heart, I simply am not able to continue, she wrote.\n\nBecause I believe that the mental health of our people has suffered so greatly under the stresses of COVID-19, the social justice issues that have been so painful for so many, and now with the rending of our nation over questions raised about the presidential election, I cannot support language that results in incitement of violence and risks our very existence, she added.\n\nAdditionally, Anthony Ruggiero, senior director for counterproliferation and biodefense at the National Security Council, resigned on Thursday in protest of the President's incitement of protests of supporters at the Capitol, according to a person familiar. Ruggiero leads the council's North Korea policy and is a key East Asia expert.\n\nStephanie Grisham, Betsy DeVos, Elaine Chao, Elinore McCance-Katz, Sarah Matthews, Ryan Tully, Mick Mulvaney, John Costello, Matt Pottinger, Tyler Goodspeed, Rob Greenway, Anna Christina Niceta\n\nThursday's outgoing cohort followed a similar tranche of administration resignations the previous day. Trump's deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger resigned Wednesday afternoon.\n\nStephanie Grisham -- the former White House communications director and press secretary and current chief of staff for first lady Melania Trump -- and White House social secretary Anna Cristina Rickie Niceta both resigned Wednesday effective immediately, White House officials told CNN. The two were among the longest-serving Trump administration officials.\n\nThe riot at the Capitol has also triggered departures outside the administration. The chief of the Capitol Police is resigning effective January 16. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House sergeant-at-arms, Paul Irving, was submitting his resignation, while Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger submitted his own resignation late Thursday, according to a statement by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nChao decided to resign after taking time to absorb the insurrection on Capitol Hill and the President's response to it, a senior administration official said. The official said Chao's decision to resign on Monday -- not immediately -- was done in order to give her staff time for an orderly departure and transition.\n\nChao discussed the matter with her staff and her husband, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, before deciding around 11 a.m. that she would resign.\n\nToday, there was a lot of soul-searching and discussion, a senior official said. It was obviously the right thing to do.\n\nBefore releasing her statement, Chao called White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to inform him of her decision, the senior official said. She has not as of yet submitted a letter of resignation to the President.\n\nChao encouraged senior officials at the Transportation Department to stay on until January 20 to ensure a smooth transition. Several of her senior staff were considering resigning as well, but were talked out of it by Chao, this official said.\n\nThe department's general counsel Steven Bradbury is next in the line of succession because there is currently no deputy secretary. He would become acting Transportation secretary unless the President names another individual to the post.\n\nA veteran of Republican administrations, Chao came into her post with a focus on reviving the nation's crumbling infrastructure.\n\nBut an overhaul package to rebuild roads, bridges and highways never came, stalled by other legislative priorities including tax cuts and health care. The administration did unveil a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan earlier in Trump's administration, but the framework has faced obstacles in Congress.\n\nA succession of White House-sponsored Infrastructure Weeks did little to advance the cause. The term has become a punch line for the administration's ability to step on its own message with unforced errors or a President prone to inflammatory tweets or remarks.\n\nChao had until now remained a dutiful foot soldier for the President, appearing at White House events and traveling the country to view administration-sponsored projects.\n\nUnlike much of the administration, Chao came to her post with years of government experience. She served in both Bush administrations, acting as labor secretary for all eight years of President George W. Bush's tenure.\n\nTrump has eyed some Bush veterans skeptically, though isn't known to have singled out Chao specifically.\n\nInstead, it is her husband that has sometimes proved the awkward component in her relationship with Trump. The President has openly sparred with the Republican leader in the Senate over legislative priorities.\n\nChao had previously navigated the spats deftly. Standing alongside Trump in August 2017 in the midst of a dispute between the President and McConnell over health care, she was asked what she thought of the rift.\n\nI stand by my man, Chao said, both of them.\n\nThis story has been updated.

And the longest government shutdown ever.\n\nAround nearly every corner, crucial question marks are looming over the business world right now.\n\nWill the US economy grow at 3% in 2019 or succumb to a recession? Will the United Kingdom be in or out of the European Union? Will the Fed raise rates twice or not at all?\n\nTaken together, these forces appear to be driving up uncertainty to elevated levels. That backdrop makes it tricky for businesses, households and investors to plan for the future.\n\nThe risk is that poor visibility causes companies to rein in spending, further delaying the investment boom that the US tax overhaul was supposed to spark.\n\nWe are in an uncertain environment on the policy front and the economic front — and that spills over into the corporate front, said Erin Browne, a managing director and portfolio manager at PIMCO.\n\nIn some ways, a murky outlook is common as economic expansions age and the next recession begins to take shape on the horizon.\n\nAs you move towards late cycle, the level of uncertainty increases. And the level of volatility around economic outcomes also increases, Browne said.\n\nOne measure of this volatility, the global economic policy uncertainty index, shot to a record high in December. The index, which goes back to January 1997, measures how often newspaper articles in 20 countries contain terms related to the economy, policy and uncertainty.\n\nThere's no shortage of questions swirling around board rooms right now. Consider the headlines from just the past few days.\n\nTrade war lingers, Brexit mess deepens\n\nThe United States and China, the world's two biggest economies, remain mired in a trade war. Fragile talks on reaching a trade deal have yet to produce a breakthrough.\n\nIn the meantime, economists say the tariff spat is exacerbating the sharp slowdown in China. And it's at least partially to blame for the sudden deceleration of America's manufacturing industry and an outright contraction in China's.\n\nApple (AAPL), the world's largest public company, recently said trade tensions helped lead to soft iPhone sales.\n\nIn Europe, the British parliament resoundingly rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal, raising the risk that her government collapses. The vote also deepens questions over whether the UK will crash out of the EU or decide to remain or further delay a decision. A messy divorce could spark market turmoil and fuel a recession in the UK, the world's fifth-biggest economy.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany's economy contracted in the third quarter and 2018 growth was the weakest in five years.\n\nThe rest of the world is clearly tugging the US downward, said Browne.\n\nVolatility in Washington, energy\n\nIn Washington, the shutdown of the federal government stretched into its 26th day on Wednesday. Each day is causing more damage to the economy — and more pain for the 800,000 federal workers going without pay.\n\nCorporate America is beginning to feel the pain as well. Delta Air Lines (DAL) estimates that fewer bookings caused by the government shutdown will cost the company about $25 million in January.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon warned Washington on Tuesday that if the shutdown lasts for the entire quarter, it could reduce economic growth to zero.\n\nMeanwhile, the oil patch is living up to its well-worn reputation for volatility. US oil prices crashed into a bear market last fall, plunging as much as 44%. Crude has since spiked 22% in just three weeks on signs that OPEC is dialing back production.\n\nThe gyrations in the energy market won't make the budget process any easier for airlines, trucking and other businesses that rely on crude.\n\nThe oil turbulence also helped lead to the shutdown of the junk bond market in December, the first month without a US high-yield bond offering in a decade.\n\n'Wild' market swings\n\nWall Street is still mending its wounds from the worst December stock market performance since the Great Depression. Extreme volatility led to sharp trading revenue declines at JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup (C).\n\nEven though US stocks have rebounded, there's always a risk that prolonged market mayhem dents consumer and business sentiment enough to impact the real economy.\n\nWe saw wild risk-off swings, John Shrewsberry, Wells Fargo's chief financial officer, told reporters on Tuesday. That could have a knock-on effect to invest confidence, and maybe consumer and business confidence.\n\nFed policy remains another major mystery. Just a few months ago, Wall Street was prepared for the US central bank to raise interest rates another four times. But market stress and slowing global growth caused the Fed to hint that it may be done with rate hikes, at least for now.\n\nEven Esther George, a hawkish Fed official, said in a speech on Tuesday that it might be a good time to pause rate hikes. And George acknowledged it's unclear whether, or how much, the Fed's shrinking balance sheet is causing borrowing conditions to tighten.\n\nRecession or slowdown?\n\nEconomists and investors continue to clash over whether the American economy is headed toward a recession, or just a sharp slowdown like the one experienced in 2016.\n\nNearly half of the US CFOs surveyed by Duke University expect a 2019 recession. And 82% believe that a recession will strike by the end of 2020.\n\nBut fund managers' point of view is quite different. Just 14% of them expect a global economic recession this year, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey published on Tuesday.\n\nTheir diagnosis is secular stagnation, not a recession, Michael Hartnett, Bank of America's chief investment strategist, wrote in the Tuesday report.\n\nStill, the risk is that extreme uncertainty becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, speeding the arrival of the next downturn by causing business and consumer spending to dry up.\n\nIt's inevitable we will get a recession in the next few years. The question is timing, said Browne. This could pull forward the onset of the next recession.
India just got a ringing endorsement from the world's most famous investor.\n\nI think the potential for India is incredible, Warren Buffett said in an interview with Indian news channel ET Now on Monday, describing the South Asian nation as a huge, enormous market.\n\nThe Berkshire Hathaway chairman, also known as the Oracle of Omaha, said he'd immediately hop on a plane to India if the right investment opportunity came up.\n\nIf you tell me a wonderful company in India that might be available for sale, I'll be there tomorrow, he said.\n\nRelated: Warren Buffett says he dumped a third of his IBM stock\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tried to smooth the way for foreign investors such as Buffett, but there are still many hurdles standing in their way.\n\nCompanies such as Walmart (WMT) and Apple (AAPL), which both feature in Buffett's huge portfolio, have thus far failed to open their own stores in the country.\n\nBerkshire set up operations in India when Buffett visited in 2011, selling insurance online in a partnership with Indian firm Bajaj Allianz. But Buffett's firm reportedly exited that partnership two years later, citing excessive regulation.\n\nRelated: Why Walmart is interested in India's biggest online retailer\n\nBuffett mentioned those hurdles again on Monday, particularly one that prevents foreign firms from fully owning companies in India.\n\nSometimes there have been restrictive laws in terms of the percentage we can own, and that's a disadvantage, he said. We would like to own 100% of any business that we run.\n\nRelated: Warren Buffett laments missing out on Google\n\nModi has tried to make it easier to do business, but many of his big reforms -- such as a uniform national tax system that is yet to be implemented -- have fallen short of expectations.\n\nAnother famous investor, Jim Rogers, sold all his Indian shares in 2015 after getting tired of waiting for change.\n\nYou can't just invest on hope, he said in an interview with Indian newspaper Livemint at the time.\n\nBuffett says the country's huge population and rapidly growing middle class is too big to ignore.\n\nIt's a lot of people with a lot of buying power, he said. You can't have a billion people and not be important to this world.
That was exactly as wild as it seemed.\n\nThe VIX volatility index, which tracks short-term market turbulence, jumped 116% on Monday -- the highest daily percentage recorded. The index has data going back to 1990.\n\nIt's the biggest move since February 2007, when the index rose 64%.\n\nThat shows how much fear has jumped back into the market in a very short period of time, said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.\n\nMonday was the worst day for markets in recent memory.\n\nThe Dow plunged almost 1,600 points before recovering slightly. It closed down 1,175 points, the worst single-day point decline in Dow history. Its 4.6% fall was the biggest percentage decline since August 2011, during the European debt crisis.\n\nRelated: CNNMoney Fear & Greed index is in Extreme Fear\n\nThe VIX reflected that turmoil.\n\nThe index, which hit 37.32, is now the highest it's been since August 24, 2015, the last time the Dow plunged 1,000 points in a day.\n\nA big reason for the sudden surge in volatility is that stocks have been calm for months, which has kept the VIX tamped down.\n\nThe index touched an all-time intraday low of 8.56 on November 24, 2017, and was as low as 8.56 again on January 4. That relative tranquility made Monday's leap feel particularly severe.\n\nIf investors had been expecting that to change, the VIX would have been moving higher before Monday.\n\nIf anything, we should have been surprised by how low volatility was to begin with, said Andres Garcia-Amaya, CEO of wealth management firm Zoe Financial.\n\nAfter months of calm for stocks, investors could now experience some rockiness in the coming weeks.\n\nRelated: Stocks plunged. That doesn't mean the economy is in trouble\n\nOne group of investors likely to be hit hard are those who have been betting against volatility.\n\nMarket watchers are pointing to an exchange-traded security called the XIV, which is structured to go up when the VIX falls.\n\nThe XIV is down more than 82% after hours. That means investors who thought the market would continue its bull run without a sell-off could get hit.\n\nBut most people shouldn't panic, analysts say.\n\nThe market's economic underpinnings remain strong. Corporate earnings are still expected to be bolstered by tax reform, and job creation remains steady.\n\nIf you're a day trader, this is a huge deal. If you're an investor in the long term, this becomes a blip, Garcia-Amaya said.
Millions of Americans may have to wait a little longer to receive their stimulus payments from the federal government due to a glitch in distribution that is expected to be fixed soon.\n\nThe payments -- worth up to $600 per taxpayer and $600 for each of their dependents -- were part of the latest Covid relief package signed into law at the end of December.\n\nThe IRS began issuing direct deposits of those payments on December 29 and says up to 100 million have already been completed.\n\nBut, according to Intuit TurboTax spokesperson Ashley McMahon, millions of payments were sent to the wrong accounts, and some may not have received their stimulus payment.\n\nRoughly 13 million people may have been affected, according to one banking industry source.\n\nRead More

Washington (CNN) A second round of stimulus payments are on the way and many eligible families are expected to receive the money this month.\n\nThe first payments started going out on December 29 and will continue to be sent through January 15 . But anyone eligible who isn't automatically sent the money by then will have to claim it on their 2020 tax return, according to the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nCongress included the $600 payments in a sweeping pandemic aid bill passed just before Christmas. President Donald Trump stalled the bill, calling for $2,000 payments though he had largely left negotiations up to lawmakers and his Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, then ultimately signed it into law after a week-long delay.\n\nThe money comes nearly eight months after the first round of stimulus payments, worth up to $1,200 per person, were sent as part of a larger coronavirus relief package passed last March. Many of the same people will receive the money again, but there are some small eligibility differences.\n\nWhen and how will the money be sent?\n\nRecipients may have seen a direct deposit pending in their bank account as early as December 29, but the funds became officially available January 4.\n\nPaper checks or debit cards will be sent to those who don't already have a bank account on file with the Internal Revenue Service. Checks also began going out last week.\n\nSome people may not receive the money the same way as in the first round. If you received a preloaded debit card last year, the payment will not be added to that card. You'll either receive a new card in the mail or a paper check.\n\nThe law requires the Internal Revenue Service to stop issuing the payments after January 15. Those not issued a payment by then will have wait to claim it on their 2020 tax return. The money will either increase your refund or reduce the taxes you owe. If the payment was sent to an old bank account, you will also have to wait to file your taxes in order to receive the money\n\nPeople can check the status of both their first and second payments by using the Internal Revenue Service's Get My Payment online tool\n\nWho is eligible?\n\nEligibility is largely based on income. Individuals earning less than $75,000 a year will receive the full $600. Heads of household earning less than $112,500 and married couples filing jointly earning less than $150,000 are also due the full amount. They will receive $600 per child under the age of 17, which is $100 more than in the first round.\n\nThe payments start phasing out for people making more money, at a rate of $5 per $100 of additional income. Some people who received the first payment may be phased out of the second round because the payments are smaller.\n\nThey will phase out entirely at $87,000 for single filers without children and $174,000 for those married filing jointly without children, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation\n\nUndocumented immigrants who don't have Social Security numbers remain ineligible for the payments. But in a change from the first round, their spouses and children are now eligible as long as they have Social Security numbers.\n\nThose who are claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return, like some college students, remain ineligible.\n\nLost your job? You may be able to claim more money\n\nBoth the first and second round payments are based on 2019 adjust gross incomes. That means that someone who saw their income drastically fall in 2020 may be eligible for more money than they first received.\n\nIf that's the case, they may claim a Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2020 tax return. The credit eligibility and the credit amount will be based on the 2020 tax year income, according to the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nThose who may have earned more in 2020 than 2019 are not required to pay back money they have already received.
Washington (CNN) The Trump administration on Saturday announced new travel restrictions after confirmation of the first coronavirus death in the US, with President Donald Trump signaling a more robust response as US cases rise.\n\nTrump said additional cases in America were likely but cautioned the public not to panic.\n\nAdditional cases in the US are likely, Trump said, but healthy individuals should be able to fully recover.\n\nThe President, joined by members of his administration's coronavirus task force as he made comments from the White House briefing room, aimed to calm Americans.\n\nWe respectfully ask the media and politicians and everybody else involved not do anything to incite the panic, because there's no reason to panic at all, Trump said.\n\nThe President also offered his condolences to the first coronavirus death in America.\n\nDr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King County, Washington, confirmed Saturday that the individual who died was male. Trump earlier described the patient, who died in Washington state, as a medically high-risk patient in her late 50s and a wonderful woman.\n\nA senior administration official blamed the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the mix up.\n\nDr. (Robert) Redfield briefed Pence and Trump after speaking with Washington State health officials that it was a woman. Washington State has since corrected, the official said.\n\nRedfield tweeted later Saturday that the CDC erroneously identified the patient as a female in a briefing earlier (Saturday) with the President and Vice President.\n\nThe Washington patient appears to have become ill through community spread, according to Redfield, who spoke alongside the President at Saturday's briefing.\n\nTravel and coronavirus\n\nPence said at the briefing that the US would be expanding travel restrictions from Iran to include any foreign national who has visited Iran within the last 14 days. He also said the US would heighten a travel advisory for specific regions of Italy and South Korea.\n\nWe are urging Americans to not travel to the areas in Italy and the areas in South Korea that are most affected by the coronavirus, Pence said.\n\nPence also emphasized that the average American does not need to go out and buy a mask, and that at least 35 million more masks per month are expected to be produced for the United States.\n\nMore courses of action to increase the availability of masks to high-risk health care workers will be announced later Saturday, Pence said.\n\nTrump also said he'll be meeting with pharmaceutical companies at the White House on Monday to discuss developing a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nThe President's update followed a briefing from his coronavirus task force earlier in the day, which Trump said lasted for more than two and a half hours.\n\nThe President said there are now 22 cases of the novel coronavirus in the US. This number does not include individuals repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, China, or from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Those cases have been counted separately by the CDC.\n\nThere are four instances of possible community spread transmission of coronavirus -- two in California, one in Oregon and one in Washington.\n\nThe markets will all come back, Trump said. We have one problem -- we have to get this problem brought into focus.\n\nIt's certainly not a good situation. When you lose travel that's a big part of market. But for a period of time we're going to have to do what's necessary. Safety, health -- number one. The markets will take care of themselves, he continued.\n\nThe President suggested the Federal Reserve should take measures to assist with the economic dip that has resulted from the coronavirus outbreak. He also brought up his long-anticipated middle-income tax cuts.\n\nThe President has previously appeared to downplay the effects of coronavirus, saying earlier this week that he did not think community spread of the infections disease in the country was inevitable, despite that fact that CDC officials have been assessing that they expect to see community spread within the country.\n\nTrump has rarely delivered remarks to the press from the White House briefing room, but his Saturday appearance marks his second time in the room in less than a week.\n\nThe President said at a rally in South Carolina Friday that Democrats are now politicizing the virus. Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, Trump said. They have no clue, they can't even count their votes in Iowa.\n\nThis is their new hoax, Trump added.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump said he doesn't think coronavirus itself is a hoax, but the criticism is. Asked if he regretted calling it a hoax during Friday's rally, Trump said he didn't.\n\nHoax referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody, the President explained. I'm not talking about what's happening here, I'm talking about what they're doing.\n\nTrump called it the continuation of the hoax, and mentioned the Russia investigation and his impeachment.\n\nI don't like it when they are criticizing these people, and I don't like it, he said. That's the hoax I'm talking about.\n\nWorldwide, the virus has killed at least 2,922 -- including 2,835 people in China -- and there have been 85,055 confirmed cases.\n\nA senior administration official told CNN on Friday that Trump's mid-March meeting with leaders of southeast Asian countries in Las Vegas had been postponed.\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect that the individual who died in the first reported coronavirus death in the US was male.

We've just been spoiled.\n\n(CNN Business) —\n\nThe junk bond market, one of the biggest beneficiaries of easy money, has screeched to a halt.\n\nNo US high yield bonds were offered between November 30 and January 10, according to Dealogic. December marked the first month since the 2008 crisis without any junk bonds being issued, the research firm said.\n\nThe reversal of fortunes underscores how quickly sentiment can change in financial markets, especially in the riskiest pockets of Wall Street.\n\nDeep fears about the end of the economic cycle similarly led to an exodus out of momentum stocks and the oil patch. Both the Nasdaq and crude oil tumbled into bear markets.\n\nThe stock market and oil really drive the junk bond market. They were a double-barreled depressant in December, said Mark Howard, senior multi asset specialist at BNP Paribas.\n\nThe energy sector accounts for about 15% of the US high-yield market, making the junk bond market particularly sensitive to sharp swings in oil prices. The 2014-2016 oil crash sparked dozens of oil bankruptcies.\n\nThe silence of the junk bond market marks a sharp slowdown from last December, when 36 companies tapped the junk bond market to raise nearly $18 billion, according to Dealogic.\n\nThe good news is that financial markets and oil prices have been on the upswing since Christmas Eve. People are less worried, for now at least, about a recession and the US-China trade war. That could allow for a reopening of the junk bond market.\n\n'Starting to crack open'\n\nA subsidiary of Targa Resources (TRGP), an oil and natural gas pipeline company, successfully priced a high-yield offering on Thursday. In another positive sign, Targa was able to raise $1.5 billion, twice as much as the Houston-based company originally sought. Sanjay Lad, director of investor relations at Targa, told CNN Business the deal was upsized because of very strong investor demand.\n\nIt marks the first US junk bond issuance since late November.\n\nIt's starting to crack open, said Howard.\n\nThis year, US high yield bond funds posted their best start in a decade, according to UBS.\n\nStill, the boom-to-bust in junk bonds serves as another reminder of the role of easy money on financial markets.\n\nUnbelievably low interest rates from global central banks forced investors to scour for returns elsewhere. Vast sums of money were poured into high-yield debt, allowing even some companies with shoddy balance sheets to borrow at reasonable rates.\n\nBut that easy money has begun to slowly fade away, with the Federal Reserve simultaneously raising interest rates and trimming its towering balance sheet.\n\nAt the same time, Wall Street is on high alert for signs of a recession. A downturn would cause trouble for some companies that reside in the junk bond market.\n\nNot surprisingly, investors backed away from that risky market late last year. Money has flown out of high-yield bond funds in 12 of the past 13 weeks, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nThere is concern that the earnings cycle has peaked. The trade war is not a great help, said Mike Ning, chief investment officer at PhaseCapital, a boutique investment manager.\n\nProlonged shutdown could spark trouble\n\nNervous investors have similarly retreated from another risky corner of the debt market: leveraged loans. These distressed loans had been a favorite investment for years but concerns about higher borrowing costs and slowing growth have changed the risk-reward calculus.\n\nPrivate-equity giant KKR (KKR) on Wednesday revealed that it has slashed its overweight exposure to leveraged loans to zero.\n\nGiven the disclocations of late, we want a little more flexibility, Henry McVey, KKR's head of global macro & asset allocation, wrote in a report titled The Game Has Changed.\n\nThe fear is when the economic cycle ends, these highly leveraged companies will have trouble refinancing their debt. That could lead to a wave of bankruptcies.\n\nThe market was sharply constrained in the fourth quarter. If we saw a prolonged period, you would have companies that would start to have challenges, said Howard.\n\nRecord-high corporate debt\n\nConsider that US nonfinancial companies rated by Moody's were sitting on $5.7 trillion of debt as of the end of June 2018.\n\nThe ratio of nonfinancial corporate debt to GDP has never been higher going back to records that began in 1947, according to the Office of Financial Research, a Treasury Department bureau created after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nEven if a recession strikes soon, most companies aren't facing imminent deadlines to pay back debt.\n\nMany CFOs took advantage of easy money to lock in low rates for extended periods. And record-high corporate profits, boosted by the corporate tax rate, have given companies lots of ammo to repay debt.\n\nMost companies have low refinancing risk in 2019, according to a Moody's Investors Service report published on Thursday.\n\nWhen the markets get bumpy, high-yield borrowers can sit on their hands and wait, Howard said.\n\nThat's good because December showed they could be waiting a while.
Robert F. Bukaty/AP\n\nElizabeth Warren is looking at a potentially weak finish in her neighbor state of New Hampshire tonight following on a disappointing third place finish in Iowa, and her campaign manager is out with a new memo that hits at what the Warren campaign sees as the fundamental weaknesses of her rivals.\n\nIt's notable that the memo, penned by Roger Lau and just sent out to Warren supporters, draws stark contrasts between Warren and her rivals even as the senator herself remains reticent to directly go after her competitors.\n\nSome of the key critiques that Lau outlines about their top rivals include saying that Bernie Sanders has a ceiling; pointing out that Joe Biden's support among even older and black voters is eroding; questioning Pete Buttigieg's ability to appeal to diverse voters; and saying Amy Klobuchar is untested and doesn't have a long-term infrastructure in place.\n\nHere are some key lines:\n\nSenator Sanders starts with a ceiling that's significantly lower than the support he had four years ago.\n\nFormer Vice President Biden entered this race as the clear frontrunner, reaching over 40% in national polling last spring. He's now polling under 30% even among older voters and African-American voters, who have been his strongest supporters, and his support among younger voters has fallen to just 6%.\n\nFormer Mayor Buttigieg's most significant challenge is yet to come, as the contest moves into states with more diverse electorates, and he still hasn't answered tough questions about his record in South Bend.\n\nSenator Klobuchar is getting a well-deserved look from voters for the first time, but hasn't been able to build out infrastructure for the long haul, and is playing catch up on a very short timeline.\n\nAs the campaign has been doing for a while, this is clearly another effort to set expectations for a long haul fight that extends through at least Super Tuesday for the Warren campaign.
Win the lottery? Welcome to the 1%. Now here comes the taxman.\n\nThe odds of winning the record $1.5 billion jackpot in Saturday night's drawing are 1 in 292 million. Anyone who beats those odds has tremendous luck, and a colossal tax bill, to look forward to.\n\nPrize money = taxable income: Lottery winnings are taxed like income, and the IRS taxes the top income bracket 39.6%. The government will withhold 25% of that before the money ever gets to the winner. The rest has to be paid at tax time.\n\nThen there are local taxes. Of the 44 U.S. states that participate in Powerball, all but a handful will take an additional cut of the money, according to lottery statistics site USA Mega.\n\nNew Jersey's rate is among the lowest at 3%, while New York's is the highest at 8.82%.\n\nA New York City resident would probably have the highest lottery tax rate anywhere in the nation, since the city also has a municipal tax -- an additional 3.9%.\n\nRelated: Powerball jackpot hits $900 million\n\nPayout options: Exactly how much a winner owes in taxes will depend on how they opt to have the prize money distributed.\n\nLottery winners can choose to take a one-time cash payout, or to receive annual payments for the next 30 years.\n\nIf the winner opts for the lump sum, Powerball will award the jackpot's cash value, which is about $930 million. That means the recipient would pay the income tax on that amount up front.\n\nYou're even less likely to win Powerball than you think\n\nSo if a resident of New York City wins and takes the lump sum, he or she will only get about $577 million. The government will withhold about $353 million, nearly 40%.\n\nPowerball winners also have the option of collecting their prize money in annual payments, or an annuity.\n\nIn that scenario, the jackpot winner will get a small slice of the $930 million up front. Powerball invests the rest and uses the interest to pay out bigger and bigger installments over the next 30 years. Eventually the total could add up to $1.5 billion...before taxes.\n\nThe same federal and state taxes still apply, but they're paid as each installment is distributed.\n\nRelated: 114 lottery millionaires are missing\n\nWhile the first chunk of prize money will be charged the current rate, future tax bills may go up or down (probably up) depending on how lawmakers change the tax code.\n\nThe bottom line: To maximize the overall value of your winnings, most financial experts advise taking the lump sum.\n\nEven after taxes, that option can net you more than $1.5 billion over 30 years if you invest it -- even in something ultra-conservative like municipal bonds (which are tax free).\n\nBut an overly aggressive [investment] portfolio or careless and outlandish spending can leave you penniless, Wells Fargo Advisors vice president of investments Scott Kaminsky said.
For decades, millions of Indians emigrated to the Middle East to make money. Now many of them are investing their profits back home, encouraged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's overhaul of the economy.\n\nSeveral prominent businessmen in the United Arab Emirates -- home to the world's largest Indian diaspora -- have committed billions to India in the past three years. Modi's business-friendly policies are encouraging others.\n\nWe've always been hesitant to invest in India just because the bureaucracy was too much and corruption was too much, said Binay Shetty, CEO of BRS Ventures. But when the new government came in, they started changing this and we took a view that we wanted to expand, he told CNNMoney.\n\nRelated: Millions more companies are now paying tax in India\n\nShetty's father left India in 1973 for the UAE, where he first worked as a medical supplies salesman. Two years later, he launched a clinic and distribution company in Abu Dhabi, eventually building a network of hospitals across the UAE. The company, NMC Health (NMHLY), listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2012 and is now worth $8.5 billion.\n\nBRS Ventures wants to replicate that success in India. It acquired several hospitals over the past few years with 1,000 beds in total. Shetty's aim is to add at least another 4,000 beds over the next five years.\n\nThe target is to become one of the largest hospital groups in India, he said. The company is also looking towards India for other sectors it operates in, including pharmaceuticals, education and financial services. It plans to invest $300 million over the next two years.\n\nModicare: India plans free healthcare for 500 million\n\nPrime Minister Modi is guest of honor at the World Government Summit in Dubai, starting Sunday. Since taking office in 2014, he has pledged to boost India's growth and slash the country's notorious red tape.\n\nHe's had mixed results with the former, but recent moves to relax retail restrictions and overhaul the tax system have cheered foreign investors.\n\nIndia jumped 30 spots in the World Bank's ease of doing business ranking released last November. Some analysts have questioned the reliability of the ranking, but Modi and his government have touted it as a ringing endorsement of their policies.\n\nSudesh Aggarwal, a Dubai-based Indian businessman who sits on the board of the UAE Business Leaders Forum, said the World Bank's seal of approval has boosted investor sentiment.\n\nThe forum says 100 expat Indians have pooled $1 billion to invest in India.\n\nThey are open to investing in a variety of sectors such as healthcare, education, solar power and infrastructure, Aggarwal told CNNMoney, adding that the group is looking to join hands with state governments to work on specific projects.\n\nThe question is what the state governments want for their states, we work according to that, he said.\n\nSeveral other companies started by Indians based in the UAE are also expanding their footprint back home.\n\nThe Lulu Group, best known for its chain of supermarkets, already operates malls, convention centers and hotels across southern India and has several new projects in the pipeline. KEF Holdings, a construction firm that specializes in prefabricated buildings, has invested in four Indian projects worth around $180 million since 2016.\n\nAster, a Dubai-based healthcare firm, is reportedly planning an IPO on the Bombay Stock Exchange next week.\n\nThere is absolutely no doubt that several major UAE-based Indians are now making major investments into India, said Navdeep Singh Suri, India's ambassador to the UAE.\n\nBusiness is driven only partly by patriotism, it is principally driven by returns and by ease of doing business, Suri told CNNMoney. Along with the growth of the Indian economy, [investors] also see that it is becoming easier.\n\nRelated: Modi tells Davos globalization is under attack\n\nThe affection is mutual, and with good reason. More than 3 million Indians live in the UAE, according to the United Nations. (Only Mexicans in the United States constitute a larger immigrant population between two countries.)\n\nThe UAE accounts for the largest proportion of remittances sent to India, estimated at almost $13 billion in 2016.\n\nModi's visit in 2015 was the first by an Indian prime minister to visit the Gulf state in 34 years. The crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nayhan, has visited India twice since then.\n\nState money is flowing east, too. The UAE government has committed $75 billion towards developing Indian infrastructure, with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Dubai port operator DP World inking deals worth $1 billion and $3 billion respectively in recent months.\n\nAnd Emirates Airline just announced an agreement with Indian state Andhra Pradesh to help develop its aviation sector.\n\nThere's probably a lot more deals to come.\n\nWe've really [only] scratched the surface, said Suri. This is a very capital rich country, and as returns weaken in Western markets, India -- with its combination of growth, scale and stability -- is a very attractive opportunity.

Aired 1-2p ET\n\nAired November 19, 2019 - 13:00 ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\n[13:00:00] JORDAN: -- Mr. Eisenberg had told me to take my concerns to him.\n\n\n\nThen I ask you did -- did Mr. Eisenberg tell you not to report, to go around Mr. Morrison. And you said actually he did say that I shouldn't talk to any other people. Is that right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes, but there's a whole -- there's a period of time in there between when I spoke to him and when he circled back around. It wasn't that long a period of time but it was enough time for me to ...\n\n\n\nJORDAN: Enough time for you to go talk to someone that you won't tell us who it is right.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I've -- I've -- I've been instructed not to, Representative Jordan.\n\n\n\nJORDAN: Well, here's what I'm getting. The lawyer told you don't talk to any other people and you interpret that as not talking to your boss but you talk to your brother, you talk to the lawyers, you talk to Secretary (inaudible), you talk to the one guy Adam Schiff won't tell you -- won't let us -- won't let you tell us who he is. Is that right.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Representative Jordan, I did my job.\n\n\n\nJORDAN: I'm not saying you didn't. All I'm saying is you -- your -- the instructions from the lawyer was you shouldn't talk to anybody and you interpret that as don't talk to my boss but I'm going to go talk to someone that we can't even ask you who that individual is.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is incorrect.\n\n\n\nJORDAN: Well, I just read what you said. I shouldn't talk to any other people.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: The time of the gentleman has expired.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: There's -- I'm sorry, Chairman, but that sequence is not the way it played out.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nJORDAN: I'm reading through (ph) the transcript Colonel Vindman.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Jordan, please let Colonel Vindman ...\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: There's -- the sequence played out where immediately afterwards I expressed my concerns. I did my coordination function, Mr. Eisenberg circled back around, told me not to talk to anybody else. In that period of time I did not manage to talk to ...\n\n\n\nJORDAN: So that's when it happened. That's when you talked to someone.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Mr. Heck, you are recognized. Mr. Heck.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That's right.\n\n\n\nHECK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Colonel Vindman, let's go back to that pair of meetings on July 10 in Ambassador Bolton's office and down in the war (ph) room where you witness Ambassador Sondland inform the Ukrainian officials that as a prerequisite to a White House meeting between the two presidents, quote, the Ukrainians would have to deliver an investigation into the Bidens, end quote.\n\n\n\nYou said that Ambassador Sondland was quote, calling for an investigation that didn't exist into the Bidens in Burisma, is that correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\n\n\n\nHECK: It's that same afternoon you went to Mr. Eisenberg, the council, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That meeting occurred in the afternoon and within, you know, a couple -- I'm sure it was within a couple hours I spoke to Mr. Eisenberg.\n\n\n\nHECK: How did he react?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He was cool, calm, and collected. He took notes and he said he would look into it.\n\n\n\nHECK: And did he not also tell you to feel free to come back if you had additional concerns.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He did. He did, Congressman.\n\n\n\nHECK: Ambassador Sondland had told you that his request the Ukrainians had been coordinated with the chief of staff -- acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. Did you report that to Mr. Eisenberg?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I did.\n\n\n\nHECK: And what was his reaction?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He -- he took notes and he said he was going to -- he'll follow up or look into it. I don't recall exactly what he said.\n\n\n\nHECK: Colonel, you've also testified that on the July 25 call now between the two presidents, quote, there was no doubt, end quote, that President Trump asked for investigations into the 2016 election and Vice President Biden's son in return for a White House meeting. Within an hour of that call you reported back to Mr. Eisenberg, did you not?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I did.\n\n\n\nHECK: Went back to him just to see (inaudible) suggestion would be appropriate.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He's an assistant the president. He -- it was less a suggestion and more than -- more of an instruction.\n\n\n\nHECK: Did you tell the lawyers that President Trump asked President Zelensky to speak to Mr. Giuliani.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes.\n\n\n\nHECK: And the lawyers -- it was at this point, told you not to talk to anyone else.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is -- that's -- that is not correct with regards to timing. They didn't fall back -- they didn't circle back around. What ended up happening is in my coordination role I spoke to state (ph) -- I spoke to number (ph) of intelligence community and the general counsel from one of the intelligence bodies notified Mr. Eisenberg that there was -- you know that there was information on the call, on the July 25th call, as that point Mr. Eisenberg told me I shouldn't talk to anybody else about it.\n\n\n\nHECK: Colonel, I want to go back to 2014 in Iraq. When you were blown up, I presume that given the point in your military career and what else was going on in the world that upon recovery there was the very real prospect or possibility that you might once again find yourself in harms way. Is that correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes, Congressman, it happened in 2004, but yes.\n\n\n\nHECK: Four, excuse me, thank you. Did you consider leaving the military service at that point?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: No. Frankly, Congressman, I suffered light wounds I was fortunate compared to my counterparts in the same vehicle. And I returned to duty as, I think it may have been that same day.\n\n\n\n[13:05:00]\n\n\n\nHECK: But you could have been subjected to additional harm. You chose to continue service in uniform.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I continued to serve in combat for the remaining 10 or 11 months of the tour.\n\n\n\nHECK: You know, Colonel, I have to say I find it a rich but incredible painful irony that within a week of the President contrary to all advise of the Senior Military Officials he pardons those who were convicted of war crimes, which was widely decried in the military community. Within the week of him doing that he is engaged in an effort and allies on his behalf including some here today to demean your record of service and the sacrifice and contribution you have made. Indeed, sir, less than 20 minutes ago the White House officially quoted out, out of context the comments referred to earlier by Mr. Morrison in (ph) your judgment.\n\n\n\nI can only conclude, sir, that what we though was just the President is the subject of our deliberations in this inquiry isn't sufficient to capture what's happening here. Indeed what subject to this inquiry and what is apparel is our constitution and the very values upon which it is based. I want to say thank you for your service. But you know thank you doesn't cut it. Please know, however, that it comes from the bottom of my heart and I know on the bottoms of the heart of countless other Americans, thank you for the service, sir. I yield back.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Mr. Jordan.\n\n\n\nJORDAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Sunday the Speaker of United States House of Representatives called the President of the United States an impostor. Speaker of the House called the President an impostor. The guy, 63 million people for, the guy who won an Electoral College landslide, the Speaker calls an impostor. That's what happened to our country, to this Congress. The Speaker statement says it all. The Democrats have never accepted the will of the American people. Democrats don't trust the American people. The American people who wanted to send someone to this town who was willing to shake it up a bit.\n\n\n\nThey don't trust that and they have tried to do everything they can to undo what the American people decided on November 8, 2016. They've been out to get the President since the day he was elected. The whistleblowers lawyer, the whistleblowers legal team said this January 30, 2017, the President had been in office about a week, coup has starter, first of many steps. Next sentence impeachment will follow ultimately. I guess we're in the final step. It started three and half years ago. Congressman Tlaib started this Congress. First day of Congress said impeach the President.\n\n\n\nRepresentative Greene said if we don't impeach him the President's going to win reelection. We got to do it. Mot importantly, most importantly five Democrat members of this committee voted to move forward with impeachment before the phone call ever happened. The truth is the attacks actually started before the Inauguration even before the election. Ranking Member talked about this. Hi opening statement July 2016 FBI opens investigation so called Trump-Raja (ph) coordination collusion which was never there. Opened an investigation spied on two American citizens associated with the Presidential campaign. My guess is that's probably never happened in American History, but they did it.\n\n\n\nAnd for 10 months Jim Comey FBI investigated the President, guess what after 10 months they had nothing. And you know why we know that because when we disposed Mr. Comey last Congress he told us they didn't have a thing. No matter, Special Counsel Mueller gets appointed and they do a two year $40 million, 19 lawyer unbelievable investigation and guess what they come back and they got nothing. But the Democrats don't care. So now we get this, a bunch of depositions in the bunker and the basement of the Capital, witnesses who aren't allowed to answer questions about who they talked to about the phone call. We get this all based on some anonymous whistleblower, no first hand knowledge biased against the President.\n\n\n\n[13:10:00]\n\n\n\nThese facts have never changed, we learned these right away. Who worked with Vice President Biden , who wrote a memo the day after somebody talked to him about the call, awaited 18 days to file a complaint, 18 days to file a complaint. What did he do in those 18 days? We all know, ran off and talked with Chairman Schiff's staff. And then hired the legal team that I just talked about, one of those steps in the whole impeachment coup as his legal team has said.\n\n\n\nThis is scary what these guys are putting our country through. It is sad, it is scary, it is wrong. And the good news is the American people see through it all, they know the facts are on the President's side as Representative Stefanik said, four facts will never change. We've got the transcript which they never thought the President would release. Shows no coordination, not conditionality, no linkage. We got the two guys on the call President Trump, President Zelensky, who have side nothing wrong no pressure no pushing here. We've got the fact that Ukrainians didn't even know aid was held up at the time of the call and most importantly we have yet to have one witness tell us that the any evidence from anyone that President Zelensky did anything on investigations to get the aid released.\n\n\n\nThose facts will never change. The facts are on the President's side, the process is certainly not. It has been the most unfair process we have ever seen and the American people understand that. Those 63 million Americans they understand it and frankly I think a lot of other do as well. They see what this for what it is. And they know this is wrong, especially wrong just 11 months before the next election. I yield bank.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Mr. Welch.\n\n\n\nWELCH: Thank you. What this hearing is about, I think was best stated by Colonel Vindman's opening statement. The question before us is this, is it improper for the President of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate the United States citizen and political opponent? It's very well stated.\n\n\n\nI just listened to Mr. Jordan, as you did as well, and I heard his criticisms in the process, nothing really happened, a lot of people are out to get the president. I didn't hear an answer to the question, as to whether it's proper for the President of the United States to demand a foreign government to investigate a U.S. citizen and political opponent.\n\n\n\nAnd to date, I haven't heard any one of my Republican colleagues address that question.\n\n\n\nColonel Vindman and Ms. Williams, thank you. I want to ask some questions that go through the background. What's come out during this process is that we had two Ukraine policies.\n\n\n\nOne was bipartisan and long-standing, and that was to assist Ukraine, which had freed itself from the domination of Russia, to fight corruption and to resist Russian aggression. Is that a fair statement, Colonel Vindman?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I think that's a fair characterization, Congressman.\n\n\n\nWELCH: And to give folks a reminder of the extent of corruption, by the way, a legacy of Putin's Russia, is your understanding that when their prior president, Mr. Yanukovych fled to Russia into the arms of Mr. Putin, he took with him $30 to $40 billion of that impoverished country?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Those -- there are different estimates, but it's on that scale, yes.\n\n\n\nWELCH: Vast scale for a poor country. And is it your understanding that powerless, but motivated Ukrainians rose up in protest to this incredible graft in theft and abuse by their president?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\n\n\n\nWELCH: And that was in the Maidan -- it was called the Maidan Revolution, the Revolution of Dignity, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nWELCH: And young people went into that square in downtown Kiev, and demonstrated for months, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct. And 100 died.\n\n\n\nWELCH: One hundred and six young people died, and older people died, correct? That is in -- in -- in -- between February 18, 2014 and February 22, is that correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\n[13:15:00]\n\n\n\nWELCH: One hundred and six died, including people who were shot by snipers, kids, and Yanukovych had put snipers on the rooftops of buildings to shoot into that square and kill, murder, slaughter, those young people. Is that your understanding?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\n\n\n\nWELCH: In our bipartisan support, and by the way, I want to say to my Republican colleagues, a lot of leadership to have this bipartisan support came from your side, thank you. But our whole commitment was to get rid of corruption and to stop that Russian aggression, is that correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That amounts to some of the key pillars. WELCH: That's right. And the Giuliani, Sondmand (ph), and it appears, Trump policy was not about that, it was about investigations into a political opponent. Correct? I'll take that question back, we know it.\n\n\n\nAnd you know, I'm going to say this to President Trump, you want to investigate Joe Biden, you want to investigate Hunter Biden, go at it. Do it. Do it hard. Do it dirty. Do it the way you do do it. Just don't do it by asking a foreign leader to help you in your campaign. That's your job, it's not his.\n\n\n\nMy goal in these hearings is two things, one is to get an answer to Colonel Vindman's question. And the second, coming out of this, is for us, as a Congress, to return to the Ukraine policy that Nancy Pelosi and Kevin McCarthy both support. It's not investigations, it's the restoration of democracy in Ukraine and the resistance of Russian aggression. I yield back.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Mr. Maloney.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: thank you both for being here. You know, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, this may be one of your first Congressional hearings like this, so you may not --\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: And hopefully the last.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nMALONEY: I can't blame you for feeling that way, sir. Particularly when I've been sitting here listening to my Republican colleagues, one of the advantages of being down here at the kids table, is that you get to hear the folks above your ask their questions. And I've been listening closely to my Republican colleagues and I've heard them say just about everything except to contradict any of the substantive testimony you've both given.\n\n\n\nYou may have notices, there's been a lot of complaints and there's been a lot of insinuations and there's been a lot of suggestions maybe that -- that you're -- that you're service is somehow not -- not to be trusted.\n\n\n\nYou know, you were treated to questions about your loyalty because of some half-baked job offer, I guess, the Ukrainians made you, which you, of course, dutifully reported. I guess, Mr. Castor's implying you're -- you've got some dual loyalty, which is, of course, an old smear we've heard many times in our history, to try to demean you as though maybe you're -- you've overstated the your importance of your job.\n\n\n\nBut, of course, you were -- this -- the guy on the National Security Council responsible for directing Ukrainian policy. We've heard the air out some allocations, with no basis improve, but they just want to get them out there and hope maybe some of those strands of spaghetti, I guess, will stick on the wall if they keep throwing them.\n\n\n\nWe've even had a member of this Committee question -- this is my favorite, question why you would wear your dress uniform today. Even though that dress uniform includes a breastplate that has a Combat Infantry badge on it and a Purple Heart metal ribbon.\n\n\n\nSeems like if anybody gets to wear their uniform, it's somebody who's got breastplate with those accommodations on it. So, let's do it again, let's do the substance, can we do that? Because we've had a lot of -- a lot of dust kicked up.\n\n\n\nMs. Williams, you heard the call with your own ears, right?\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: Yes sir.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Not second hand, not hear say, you heard the president speak. You heard his voice on the call?\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: Correct.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And you conclusion was what he said about investigating the Bidens was your words, unusual and inappropriate, I believe. Am I right?\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: That was my testimony.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And Mr. Vindman, you were treated to a July 10th meeting in the White House, where you heard Ambassador Sondland raise investigations, conditioning a White House meeting on that investigations, that you thought were unduly political, I believe that's how you described them. And you went to NSC Council and you reported, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And then later, you too, were on the White House call, am I right? You heard it with your own ears?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Not second hand, not from somebody else, not hear say, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: You heard the president's voice on the call?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I did.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And you heard him raise that subject again, that Ambassador Sondland had raised before, about investigating the Bidens, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I did.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And I want to ask you, when you heard him say that, what was the first thought that went through your mind?\n\n\n\n[13:20:00]\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Frankly, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. There was probably an element of shock that maybe in certain regards my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out. And how this was likely to have significant implications for U.S. national security.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And you went immediately and you reported it, didn't you?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I did.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Why?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Because that was my duty.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Do you still have your opening statement handy?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I do.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Read the last paragraph for me again, not the one -- the very last one, the second to last one. Would you read that one again for me? Because I think the American public deserves to hear it again.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: The dad...\n\n\n\nMALONEY: That's the one.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I think my dad would appreciate this one too.\n\n\n\nDad, my sitting here today in the U.S. Capitol, talking to our elected officials, is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to the United States America in search of a better life for our family. Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: You realize when you came forward out of sense of duty that you are putting yourself in direct opposition to the most powerful person in the world. Do you realize that, sir?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I knew I was assuming a lot of risk.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And I'm struck by that word don't -- that phrase do not worry, you addressed your dad. Was your dad a warrior?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He did serve. It was a different military though.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And he would have worried if you were putting yourself up against the president of the United States, is that right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He deeply worried about it because in his context there was -- it was the ultimate risk.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: And why you have confidence that you can do that and tell your dad not to worry?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Congressman, because this is America. This is the country I have served and defended, that all of my brothers have served. And here, right matters.\n\n\n\nMALONEY: Thank you, sir. I yield back.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE) SCHIFF: Ms. Demings.\n\n\n\nDEMINGS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, Ms. Williams, let me thank you for your service to our nation. It truly matters.\n\n\n\nLieutenant Colonel Vindman, I had the honor of speaking to a group of veterans this past weekend. And what I said to them was that no words, no words are really adequate or sufficient to fully express our gratitude for their service to our nation. So, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, today I say to you, there are no words that are sufficient to fully express our gratitude to you for what you have done for our nation and, amazingly, what you are still willing to do for our nation.\n\n\n\nIt is vitally important that the American people understand how President Trumps unethical demand that Ukraine deliver a politically- motivated investigation in exchange for military assistance created a security risk for our, the United States of America, national security. The president was not just playing a political game by upholding military aid and meetings with Ukraine, threatening the hundreds of millions of dollars of military assistance that Congress had appropriated has real-life consequences for Ukraine and for the USA.\n\n\n\nIn your test deposition, Colonel Vindman, you testified, and I quote, a strong and independent Ukraine is critical to our security interests. Could you please explain why a strong and independent Ukraine is so critical, and why it is so vital to U.S. interests?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: We sometimes refer to Ukraine as a front-line state. It's on the front-line of Europe. It's -- they have actually described to me, the Ukrainians, that that is -- it is a -- they consider themselves as a barrier between Russian aggression and Europe. And what I have heard them describe is the need for U.S. support in order to serve this role in order to protect European and Western security.\n\n\n\nDEMINGS: Lieutenant Colonel, this is not just a theoretical conflict between Ukraine and Russia. You have already said this morning that Russia is actively fighting to expand into Ukraine, that Ukraine is in a hot war with Russia right now, is that correct?\n\n\n\n[13:25:00]\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: It's stable, but it's still a hot war.\n\n\n\nDEMINGS: And isn't it true, Lieutenant Colonel, that even if the security assistance was eventually delivered to Ukraine, the fact that it was delayed, just that fact, could signal to Russia that the bond between Ukraine and the U.S. was weakening?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That was the concern of myself and my colleagues.\n\n\n\nDEMINGS: And was the risk of even the appearance that the U.S.-Ukraine bond is shaky is that it could embolden Russia to act with more aggression, would you say that is correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I believe that was my testimony.\n\n\n\nDEMINGS: Just last month, during an interview, President Putin joked about interfering in our political elections. I can only guess that is what we have become to Russia and its president. I think he felt emboldened by the president's reckless actions, both attempts to hold critical military aid from Ukraine and President Trump's effort to blame Ukraine, not Russia, for election interference.\n\n\n\nMs. Williams and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, I can only say that every American, regardless of our politics, should be critically concerned about that. And let me just say this. Yes, we do trust the American people. But you know what, the American people trust us too as members of Congress to support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And we intend to do just that.\n\n\n\nThank you again for your service.\n\n\n\nMr. Chairman, I yield back.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: Mr. Krishnamoorthi.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Good afternoon, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and Ms. Williams. Thank you for your service.\n\n\n\nLieutenant Colonel Vindman, I am concerned that your loyalty has been questioned not just because you are bringing forward evidence of wrongdoing against the president, president of United States, but because you are an immigrant. Recently FOX News host Brian Kilmeade said, he, meaning you, were born in the Soviet Union, emigrated with his family young, he tends to feel simpatico with the Ukraine. I find this statement reprehensible because it appears that your immigrant heritage is being used against you.\n\n\n\nLieutenant Colonel, I came to this country when I was three months old. Your family fled the Soviet Union and moved to America when you are just three-and-a-half years old, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: And I understand that your father worked multiple jobs while also learning English, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Your father stressed the importance of embracing what it means to be an American, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: You and your family faced difficult times during your childhood, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes. KRISHNAMOORTHI: I can relate. That's my story too. But your father went on to become an engineer, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He reestablished himself in his former profession in the United States.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I can relate. I -- I got a B.S. in engineering. Of course some people claim I practice the B.S. part now.\n\n\n\n(Laughter)\n\n\n\nYour father never gave up working hard to build his very own American dream, did he?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He did not.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Well Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, your father achieved the American dream and so did you and your family. From one immigrant American to another immigrant American, I want to say to you that you and your family represent the very best of America. I assume that you are as proud to be an American as I am, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes, sir.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Sir, I want to turn your attention to Yuriy Lutsenko. You called him a disruptive actor in your opening statement, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Mr. Lutsenko, the former prosecutor general in Ukraine has made various claims about various Americans, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: You are unaware of any factual basis for his accusations against Ambassador Yovanovitch. Right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: He also was a source for an article by John Solomon in The Hill, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: That is correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: And you said that key elements of that article as well as his accusations are false. Right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Lutsenko is not a credible source, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\n[13:30:00]\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Sir, the other side claims that there was absolutely no pressure on this July 25 phone call. I think that's what we heard earlier, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I believe so.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: And you have termed what President Trump asked in terms of investigations on that phone call as a demand. Correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Correct.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: And you've pointed out the large power disparity between President Trump on the one hand and President Zelensky on the other. Correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: There was pressure on that phone call, right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: The -- the Ukranians needed the meeting. The Ukrainians subsequently when they found out about it needed the security assistance.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: So the pressure was brought to bear on them, correct?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I believe so.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Sir, Colonel Vindman, last week we heard a decorated military veteran namely Ambassador Bill Taylor come before us. You interacted regularly with Ambassador Taylor and you know him to be a man of integrity and he's a patriotic American. Isn't that right?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: A superb individual.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I asked Ambassador Taylor a series of questions based on his experience as an infantry commander. I asked him quote, is an officer allowed to hold up action placing his troops at risk until someone provides him a personal benefit? Ambassador Taylor responded, no sir. Colonel Vindman, do you agree with Ambassador Taylor?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I do.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I then asked Ambassador Taylor quote, is that because they would be betraying their responsibility to the nation? Ambassador Taylor responded, yes, sir. Colonel Vindman, do you agree with Ambassador Taylor?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I do.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: I then asked Ambassador Taylor, quote, could that type of conduct trigger a court martial? Ambassador Taylor said yes sir. Do you agree with Ambassador Taylor Colonel Vindman?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I do.\n\n\n\nKRISHNAMOORTHI: Thank you for your service.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: That concludes the member questioning. Representative Nunes, you're recognized for any concluding remarks. NUNES: Well Act 1 of today's circus is over. For those of you who have been watching at home, the democrats are no closer to impeachment then where they were three years ago. In the process they've -- the Department of Justice, FBI, State Department, elements within the I.C., the ICIG have all suffered long-term damage. The democrats can continue to put -- to poison the American people with this nonsense. We sat here all morning without any evidence for impeachment which would be a very serious crime, high crime and misdemeanor as it says in the Constitution. No such thing.\n\n\n\nPolicy disagreements and the democrats failure to acknowledge their involvement in the 2016 election, I would say it's astonishing but that would be putting too little emphasis on their actions. With that I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: I thank the gentleman. I want to thank our witnesses today, Ms. Williams, Colonel Vindman, both of you for your service to the country, for your testimony here today and I just want to address briefly some of the evidence you presented as well as others thus far in the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, I want to join my colleagues in thanking you Colonel Vindman for your military service and I should tell you that notwithstanding all of the questions you got on why didn't you go talk to your supervisor. Why didn't you go talk to Mr. Morrison? Why did you go to the national security lawyer as if there is something wrong with going to the national security lawyer.\n\n\n\nAre you aware that we asked Mr. Morrison whether he went to the national security lawyer right after the call and that he did.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I am.\n\n\n\nSCHIFF: And are you aware also that we asked him, well if you have this problem with Colonel Vindman not going to you instead of the lawyer, naturally you must have got your supervisor in you know what his answer was? He didn't go to his supervisor, either. He went directly to the National Security Council lawyers. I hope my colleagues will give him the same hard time for not following his chain of command that he complained about with you apparently.\n\n\n\nThe president may attack you and has. Others on right-wing TV might attack you, and they have. But I thought you should know and maybe you know already that this is what the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had to say about you Colonel Vindman. He is a professional, competent, patriotic and loyal officer. He has made an extraordinary contribution to the security of our nation in both peacetime and combat. I am sure your dad is proud to hear that.\n\n\n\n[13:35:00]\n\n\n\nMy colleagues have tried to make the argument here today and we've heard it before that the president was just interested in fighting corruption. That's our goal, fighting corruption in Ukraine, this terribly corrupt country. The problem of course with that is there is no evidence of the president trying to fight corruption. The evidence all points in the other direction. The evidence points the direction of the president inviting Ukraine to engage in the corrupt act of investigating a U.S. political opponent.\n\n\n\nAmbassador Yovanovitch was known as a strong fighter of corruption so what does the president do? He recalls her from her post. Ambassador Yovanovitch, in fact, was at a meeting celebrating other anticorruption fighters including a woman who had acid thrown in her face on the day she was told to get on the next plane back to Washington. You prepared talking points for the president's first conversation with Zelensky. He's supposed to talk about rooting out corruption. If this President had such a deep interest in rooting out corruption in Ukraine, surely he would've brought it up in the call but of course we now know that he did not.\n\n\n\nWe then see Rudy Giuliani not fighting corruption but asking for an investigation of the Bidens and my colleagues say well maybe he was acting on his own. Even though he says he's acting as the President's lawyer, maybe he was really acting on his own but the two investigations that Rudy Giuliani wanted, come up in the meeting you participate in on July 10th at the White House, when Ambassador Sondland brings up the Bidens and Burisma of 2016, tells the Ukrainians who want that meeting at the White House, you've got to do these investigations.\n\n\n\nNow they would say Ambassador Sondland was acting on his own, but that doesn't quite work either because we have the call record from July 25th, which the President was forced to release, in which the President doesn't bring up corruption, he doesn't say how are those anti-corruption courts going or great work at the Rada. Of course not.\n\n\n\nWhat does the President say? I want you to invest the -- investigate the Bidens and this debunked conspiracy theory pushed by Vladimir Putin, that also helps me in my re-election. So much for fighting corruption.\n\n\n\nThe message to Ukraine -- the real message to Ukraine, our U.S. policy message is don't engage in political investigations. The message from the President, however, was the exact opposite -- do engage in political investigations and do it for my re-election.\n\n\n\nAnd it's also made clear they want the White House meeting and ultimately if they want $400 million in U.S. aid, this is what they have to do. The only lament I hear from my colleagues is it wasn't successful, they got caught, they didn't get the political investigations and they still had to release the money. Now, they still haven't gotten the White House meeting but they had to release the money because the whistleblower blew the whistle -- the whistleblower the President wants to punish -- and because Congress announced it was doing investigations, and very soon thereafter, the President was forced to lift the hold on the aid.\n\n\n\nThey argue well this makes it -- this makes it OK, that it was a failed effort to bribe Ukraine, a failed effort to extort Ukraine. That doesn't make it better, it's no less odious because it was discovered and it was stopped. And we have courageous people like yourself who come forward, who report things, who do what they should do, who have a sense, as you put it, Colonel, of duty -- of duty. Not to the person of the President, but to the presidency and to the country, and we thank you for that.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, I think this all comes back to something we heard from another career foreign service officer just last Friday, in a conversation he overheard with the President in a restaurant in Ukraine, in which the President, not Rudy Giuliani, not anyone else, the President of the United States wanted to know are they going to do the investigation? This is the day after that July 25th call -- are they going to do the investigations? And he's ensured by Ambassador Sondland they're going to do it.\n\n\n\nAnd what does Sondland relate to this foreign service officer after he hangs up that call? The President doesn't give a expletive about Ukraine, he only cares about the big things that help his personal interests. That's all you need to know.\n\n\n\nAnd it isn't just about Ukraine. Of course, Ukraine is fighting our fight against the Russians, against their expansionism. That's our fight, too -- that's our fight, too, at least we thought so on a bipartisan basis, that's our fight, too. That's why we support Ukraine with the military aid that we have.\n\n\n\n[13:40:00]\n\n\n\nWell the President may not care about it but we do. We care about our defense, we care about the defense of our allies and we darn well care about our Constitution. We are adjourned. I please ask the -- the audience to allow the witnesses and the members who have to go vote to leave first.\n\n\n\nJAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: I'm Jake Tapper, live in Washington.\n\n\n\nToday's first round of the impeachment hearings for this week is in the books. We just heard from Jennifer Williams. She's a State Department aide to Vice President Mike Pence. We also heard from Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman. He is the National Security Council's top Ukraine advisor at the White House.\n\n\n\nHouse Intelligence Democrats have largely focus on the witnesses' impression of that phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky on July 25th, which both of them were listening to, while Republicans have attempted to discredit and undermine the witnesses, especially Lieutenant Colonel Vindman.\n\n\n\nBefore we get to an analysis, I want to play to what could be a key point of this entire investigation of this entire impeachment hearing.\n\n\n\nWhen you strip away the Democrats talking about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's patriotism, his service, his inspiring story as an immigrant to this country when he was a little boy, when you strip away Republicans trying to undermine him, questions about whether or not he followed the chain of command when it came to his concerns about the call, this is really what this hearing is about.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nDANIEL GOLDMAN, COUNSEL FOR HOUSE DEMOCRATS: So just to summarize in this July 25th call between the presidents of the United States and Ukraine, President Trump demanded a favor of President Zelensky to conduct investigations that both of you ang acknowledge were for President Trump's political interest, not the national interest, and in return for his promise of a much-desired White House meeting for President Zelensky.\n\n\n\nColonel Vindman, is that an accurate summary of the excerpts we just looked at in.\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Yes.\n\n\n\nGOLDMAN: Miss Williams?\n\n\n\nJENNIFER WILLIAMS, AIDE TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Yes.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Jeffrey Toobin, your response?\n\n\n\nJEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: When you strip away everything, what we have learned over the past month is one thing, which is for the first time in American history, an American president has used taxpayer dollars to persuade, bribe, extort another president for information that will help him get reelected.\n\n\n\nThat was the initial accusation. And that's what's been proven over and over again with all these witnesses.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Dana Bash?\n\n\n\nDANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. And what you haven't heard is any Republican on that day say anything other than that. No Republican has tried, even attempted to poke a hole in that fundamental question, why we are all here, why these hearings are taking place.\n\n\n\nWhat Republicans did instead is question the credibility of the witness, question the story, repeat conspiracy theories that have been debunked by the Intelligence Community.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: About whether or not Russia or Ukraine interfered in the election?\n\n\n\nBASH: Yes. And by the Trump Justice Department, which we can get to in a second. But just keeping it broad, the fact that Republicans didn't even try to go there on the substance of the allegation and what the picture of these witnesses, just like the ones last week, painted, is very, very telling. It goes to the notion of, OK, he did it. And a lot of these\n\n\n\nRepublicans have said in other forums, it wasn't the right thing to do but it's not impeachable and the process is bad.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: John King, during the hearing, President Trump didn't tweet at Lieutenant Colonel Vindman or Jennifer Williams as he has before about both of them.\n\n\n\nBut the White House official account did tweet something -- if we could put that tweet up. The White House official account, paid by your tax dollars, if you're an American watching right now, saying, Tim Morrison, Alex Vindman's former boss, said he had concerns about Vindman's judgement.\n\n\n\nNow that is factually accurate to Morrison, who is no longer on the National Security Council. Did say that he had concerns about whether or not Vindman had the right policy making chops for the job.\n\n\n\nBut it is remarkable to see taxpayer dollars being used to attack a current National Security Council official.\n\n\n\nJOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. First, you had the president do it. He's faced a lot of blowback from Republicans, saying please don't do that, please don't attack these witnesses, we're trying to do this on a different track. Now you have the taxpayer accounts, as you mentioned, doing it here.\n\n\n\nBut it's part of the Republican strategy. Number one -- and you saw some of this in the hearing as well -- Mr. Morrison did say that.\n\n\n\nIf you read the full transcript of Mr. Morrison, he said something damaging about the president. He, too, went to the National Security Council lawyer and reported his concerns about the call.\n\n\n\nThey Republicans are and this is smart politically -- it would be smart in a trial for a lawyer -- they're cherry-picking the information that they believe helps them. They're want challenging the facts. I think that is the most important part.\n\n\n\n[13:45:04]\n\n\n\nWe've now had five witnesses in public hearings, the public impeachment hearings, and the Republicans are not challenging the facts.\n\n\n\nThe facts are being billed that everyone involved, whether they're in Ukraine or the State Department or today inside the West Wing of the White House, thought this was off the rails, thought it was wrong, thought it was improper, though it was possible illegal when you got to the question of putting the hold on the money. The Republicans aren't challenging that.\n\n\n\nWhat they're trying to do is hold the Republicans in line by raising questions about judgment, about loyalty, about maybe political motivations or we're you leaking. It's all a side show, but it's an important side show politically to keep Republicans from breaking. TAPPER: Laura Coates, your take on, this time, not the president but\n\n\n\nthe White House itself attacking a witness -- that's my interpretation -- I should say criticizing, publicly airing critical testimony against one witness while that witness was testifying?\n\n\n\nLAURA COATES, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: What I really have a problem with is this idea in isolation not providing the full context of the statement. When you do that and you use selective quotes, you mislead the public and the job of the White House is not to do just that. It's supposed to guide the public to lead them in genuine fact. In fact, that didn't happen. That led to the quote.\n\n\n\nThe real issue for me is let's compare last week to now. Last week, it was all about, well, he was inappropriate but not outlandish. Now it's, you described an abuse of power, you described a quid pro quo, but you didn't say the words bribery and extortion, therefore, it's not really a problem. That's the only leg they have to stand on.\n\n\n\nThat combined with -- the really offensive one here to me was the idea of, who are you to tell me this information, Vindman? They questioned why he had the audacity to want his name referred to as lieutenant colonel instead of mister. Who do you think you are? You have the audacity to wear your uniform in this courtroom, this professional hearing room. Who do you think you are?\n\n\n\nAnd here you are, taking outside --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: You see Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother, who also works in the White House, walking through the halls.\n\n\n\nI'm sorry.\n\n\n\nCOATES: And you have both of them walking the halls and both in positions of real power. But he refused repeatedly to overstate his position. He refused to say that he was somebody who was in charge of policy.\n\n\n\nNobody questioned that he was in charge of policy to the -- that the president of the United States had the prerogative to set foreign policy as the real -- real diplomat. But they tried to attack him for that because they had nothing else there. It was the audacity arguments, the semantics.\n\n\n\nI think it's the most effective unpersuasive and effective here. And one was, as Dana was talking about, if you do not have anything to retort to the actual substance, you have to fire shots at the messenger and take the position of, well, it may be important for the world to have heard this, but you were the wrong person to tell us.\n\n\n\nIf that's the case, Jake, who should it have been?\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Andrew McCabe, former deputy director of the FBI, you know a little about mean tweets from President Trump and the White House.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: So without going through your entire history, we heard Ambassador Yovanovitch last week say, in real time, that she found President Trump's tweet intimidating. Republicans have said that mean tweets cannot be intimidating, it just mean tweets, who cares.\n\n\n\nHaving been on the end of it, having been on the end of a negative campaign from President Trump, coming from the White House, what is it like? Is it intimidating? And what do you say to people who say, it's just a negative tweet, who cares?\n\n\n\nANDREW MCCABE, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: First of all, nobody said that to me because that's not what it is. It's absolutely horrifying. I know that from my time still serving in government, while I was serving as deputy director and acting director.\n\n\n\nTo be receiving those sorts of attacks from the president that you serve, while you're in a government position, and therefore not in any position to ever respond or reply or defend yourself in public, it is both horrifying to be turned upon like that by our chief executive of the nation.\n\n\n\nAnd also just oddly -- you just feel so defenseless because there's absolutely nothing you can do to respond to it, to respond in a way with the sort of amplification and clarity that the president has when he speaks about anything.\n\n\n\nIt is absolutely horrifying. It's chilling to your family.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: We heard Lieutenant Colonel Vindman say it's not just about the attacks of the president, it's everything it set off.\n\n\n\nMCCABE: Right, that it sets off. It unleashes a whole torrent of the president's supporters, people who follow him closely, voters and folks like that. But even worse so, people on the Hill, other folks, elected representatives, in positions of authority, who pick up these false narratives and then begin to repeat the lies that the president says about you.\n\n\n\nIt's just -- I can't even adequately describe it. And I know exactly how Ambassador Yovanovitch feels.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: So stepping back from that tweet from the White House, John Dean, tell us what you think was effective. What wasn't effective, what point were made?\n\n\n\n[13:50:06]\n\n\n\nJOHN DEAN, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL: If I could just footnote what Andrew said about having been attacked. He knows, I know, you know the basic truth of what happened and efforts to stir up, confuse it. You get a certain comfort in knowing you've told the truth, and attacks just don't affect that.\n\n\n\nI happened to have been in the Witness Protection Program, so I had extra help in protecting myself. But what's happened this morning, to me, was not surprising. There was a lot of speechifying. Republicans found they really had no questions very quickly and posturing, and started posturing, attacking the process. And it shows the weakness of their position overall. The Democrats obviously refuted some of that.\n\n\n\nBig picture, nothing has changed. We're getting more confirmation, the public is getting educated, putting faces on these people and learning what, indeed -- how unprecedented that a president would use his office in this manner to get political advantage over his potential opponent.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Scott Jennings, I want to ask about one point that I thought was not ineffective by Republican Congressman Chris Stewart, of Utah, taking issue with Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's use of the word demand for that part of the call with President Trump, suggesting he'd like a favor and wants President Zelensky to do something for him.\n\n\n\nWe heard Jennifer Williams and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman say they thought it was inappropriate and a demand.\n\n\n\nBut here's Chris Stewart taking issue with that. Take a listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nREP. CHRIS STEWART (R-UT): Much has been talked about as we discussed between President Trump and President Zelensky and the word favor and it being interpreted as a basis for impeachment.\n\n\n\nAnd your interpretation of the word favor -- and I'll paraphrase you and feel free to correct me. You said, In the military culture, which you and I are both familiar with, when a superior officer asks for a favor of a subordinate, they will interpret that as a demand.\n\n\n\nIs that a fair synopsis of what you previously stated?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Representative, when a superior makes a request, that's an order.\n\n\n\nSTEWART: OK. In short then you think your interpretation of a favor is a demand based upon your military experience in the military culture?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: I think that is correct.\n\n\n\nSTEWART: I think that is correct. Is President Trump a member of the military?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: He is not.\n\n\n\nSTEWART: Has he ever served in the military?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Not that I'm aware of.\n\n\n\nSTEWART: Is President Zelensky a member of the military? VINDMAN: I don't believe so.\n\n\n\nSTEWART: The answer is, he's not.\n\n\n\nWould it be fair then to take a person, who has never served in the military, and to take your re-evaluation of their words based on your military experience and your military culture, and to attach that culture and that meaning of those words to someone who's never served?\n\n\n\nVINDMAN: Representative, I made that judgment, and I stick by that judgment.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nTAPPER: He calls in nonsense. I think that's nonsense, is what Stewart says right after I made that judgment. What do you think?\n\n\n\nSCOTT JENNINGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes. I thought it was an interesting line of questioning. But it went to the overall assertion by Republicans today that Vindman isn't in a position to know exactly what the president's state of mind was.\n\n\n\nOn other occasions, he says he never met or advised the president directly. He said, quote, I don't know what the president was thinking. He said, quote, I was making a judgment call as a layman.\n\n\n\nWhat Stewart was doing was effective. To say you heard this but, because you don't know the president, you didn't speak to the president, and have a different frame of reference, you're giving your opinion instead of what may be the most important fact, which is what is the president's state of mind.\n\n\n\nIt's fine for Republicans to argue that today and I thought it was effective. That's all going to change tomorrow when Gordon Sondland shows up, because he actually has been talking to the president.\n\n\n\nI view today, Jake, as bit of a bridge day to get to the main event, which is Sondland.\n\n\n\nKING: It is a smart strategy. The Republicans are trying to get that one or two moments that are played on FOX News, that are played on social media, Trump-friendly social media. Where you say, aha, you think it's a demand, because you're a colonel, but the president wouldn't.\n\n\n\nRepublicans want you to focus on that one moment. The other day, it was, well, Ambassador Yovanovitch, if they wanted to remove you so they could be corrupt in Ukraine, why replace you with Bill Taylor, a man of great integrity? They want you to look at the one moment as opposed to the weeks before, the weeks after, which is Sondland, and more on what Rudy Giuliani were up to.\n\n\n\nTOOBIN: Far be it for me to predict what viewers of FOX News will think. But can we talk about what a crazy position Stewart was taking there? This president of Ukraine has people dying from lack of military equipment. He has people dying every day because they don't have military equipment.\n\n\n\n[13:55:00]\n\n\n\nDonald Trump holds in his hand the potential to save the lives of Ukrainians. Do you think maybe he's going to agree to what Donald Trump says about anything to get that money?\n\n\n\nI mean, the idea that this is -- well, it would be nice if you investigated Joe Biden. It's not a request. It's a demand with Ukrainians lives on the line.\n\n\n\nTAPPER: Hold that thought. We'll talk about that.\n\n\n\nWe'll take a quick break.\n\n\n\nUp next, the impeachment testimony resumes with two additional witnesses.\n\n\n\nPlus, the president just responded to today's hearing.\n\n\n\nStay with us.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[14:00:00]
Repealing and replacing Obamacare not only would change health coverage and costs for tens of millions of Americans, it would also give a juicy tax gift to the rich.\n\nRolling back Obamacare would provide a nearly $1 trillion tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthy and businesses.\n\nBut if Republican repeal efforts fail, House Speaker Paul Ryan signaled Tuesday that no one should expect lawmakers to include those tax cuts in tax reform.\n\nIf the health care bill doesn't pass, then that trillion dollars of Obamacare taxes ... we won't incorporate those in tax reform, Ryan said on CNBC's Power Lunch.We will have to put those off to the side and they will have to be gotten to when we get to health care reform.\n\nGiven how hard repealing Obamacare has been so far, there's little reason to assume it will get much easier. So for all intents and purposes those taxes will stand indefinitely. They include a high-income Medicare surtax on investment income and on wages over $200,000 ($250,000 if married).\n\nThe likely reason why tax writers have decided to leave Obamacare tax cuts off the agenda is cost, plain and simple. It would make their efforts to reform the tax code that much more expensive and therefore harder to pay for. And they will need to pay for it as a condition for passing it with a simple majority in the Senate.\n\nAdding $1 trillion to the cost of the tax bill would make it even harder to make it revenue neutral. As it is, it's a heavy lift, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.\n\nRelated: Who pays if Congress kills the state and local tax deduction\n\nTax reform will be a heavy lift for many reasons. For starters, there are still big disagreements within the Republican party itself as to how low tax rates should be and whether it's even necessary to pay for tax cuts.\n\nIf they're not paid for, not only would tax reform add substantially to deficits, but under Senate rules, they would expire at the end of the budget window instead of becoming permanent, which is what Ryan wants.\n\nThe White House has been in regular talks with leaders and top tax writers in the House and Senate to come up with a framework for a tax reform bill they can all agree on.\n\nDespite what many skeptics believe, Ryan on Tuesday said after a speech before the National Association of Manufacturers that he's confident there will be a tax reform bill on the floor this fall and passage by the end of the year.
Story highlights Authorities describe how they shut down a Texas sex slave and human trafficking operation Notorious alleged pimp Alfonso Poncho Diaz-Juarez remains on the run\n\nGot a tip about this case? Contact the FBI with any information here.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nEsperanza was waiting for her cousins outside her high school in Mexico one day, when a strange man drove up in a car, forced her inside with him and sped away. At that moment, Esperanza had in effect become a sex slave.\n\nHe beat and raped me, she told CNN's The Hunt with John Walsh.\n\nShe said the man – who called himself Poncho — brought her to a madam who showed Esperanza how to charge clients and how to use a condom.\n\nA few times Esperanza tried — and failed — to escape, but she said Poncho, now age 47, always tracked her down, and then beat her.\n\nEventually, Esperanza realized she was pregnant. Three months later, she said Poncho drove her across the Mexican-US border and on to Houston, Texas, where he forced her to work in a cantina called La Costenita.\n\nShe gave birth to a baby girl, but Poncho took the infant away as insurance that Esperanza would keep working as a sex slave and wouldn't escape.\n\nPHOTO: Photo Illustration/CNN Alfonso Diaz Juarez is accused of human trafficking in a Houston-area prostitution sting.\n\nI really wanted to speak up, to ask the police for help, Esperanza said. But I got caught up by the threats he would make towards my daughter. I didn't want anything to happen to her.\n\nEsperanza — whose real name is being withheld for her protection — had become just like the more than 19,000 sex trafficking cases reported in the US since 2007, according to the National Human Trafficking Resource Center.\n\nThe site says more than 2,600 sex trafficking cases have been reported in the US this year alone, most of them in California. Texas ranks as the nation's number-two sex trafficking state, on the website.\n\nA 'crime that happens in third world countries'\n\nFor the uninitiated, it's hard to imagine that thousands of young people — overwhelmingly women — have been kidnapped in Mexico or elsewhere and taken against their will to the United States, where they serve as sex slaves.\n\nI thought human trafficking was just this crime that happens in third world countries. Until I started to look into my city, said Rachel Alvarez, a human trafficking case worker for the Houston YMCA.\n\nRelated story: How to help sex trafficking victims\n\nTexas authorities first met Esperanza when they raided La Costenita in 2010.\n\nHer initial demeanor was just kind of stoic, remembered Steve Roskey, who took part in the raid when he was an agent with the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. But then, all of a sudden, we noticed tears start running down her face. She started telling us her story: how she got here, what she was forced to do.\n\nWhen she told police that her pimp, a man named Alfonso Diaz-Juarez who also went by Poncho, was holding her daughter, authorities sprang into action.\n\nWe knocked on Poncho's family members' houses, we knocked on his friends' houses, Roskey said. It irritated the family and friends so much that (Diaz-Juarez) eventually dropped off the child to a cousin, and at about 3 o'clock in the morning, we got a phone call. The child was safe.\n\nBut Diaz-Juarez was nowhere to be found.\n\nAmerica's human trafficking 'hubs'\n\nPimps will often lure women from Mexico across the border to the US by promising them better lives, perhaps a better job, Alvarez said. These pimps may get help from people the women already know and trust, like a neighbor.\n\nOnce they're kidnapped, these women are no longer viewed as people in the eyes of their handlers. They've been reduced to a commodity that can be bought and sold repeatedly in an open market. In the United States, Houston has become one of those markets.\n\nPeople see Houston as a hub for human trafficking because of its proximity to the border, said FBI special agent Suzanne Bradley. It also has access to the I-10 highway corridor, which goes across the country, so if they're smuggling people in and trying to get them into human trafficking in other areas of the country, it's very easy to get them on that I-10 route and disperse them throughout the country.\n\nRelated story: Why Atlanta is a US hub for sex trafficking\n\n'One of the most violent pimps'\n\nAfter the kidnapped women are brought into the US, the beatings begin as a way to keep them from trying to escape. Their captors threaten to hurt family members. Pimps use fear to keep their sex slaves in bondage.\n\nPoncho was one of the most violent pimps I've come across in the 11 years I've worked human trafficking, said Edwin Chapuseaux, a former investigator with the Harris County Sheriff's Office. He did a lot of brutal things, bordering into torture, to make the girls do what he wanted.\n\nA former sex slave we'll call Laura said Poncho knew her mother's name, her address, everything. He would threaten me, tell me if I talked to anyone that he would hurt my family.\n\nA pimp would have a lot to lose if a girl walked out the door.\n\nIf a pimp has, let's say, four or five girls, and each one is making him, you know, $2,000, $3,000 a week, do the math, tax-free, said Chapuseaux. That works out to a maximum of $780,000 per year.\n\nLaura recalls one night when she counted 70 women working. The usual was 30 men. We each had to tend to 30 clients a night.\n\nTeen girls available for $500 an hour\n\nFor years federal and local authorities had been gathering evidence against a huge Houston-area sex trafficking network led by Raquel Medeles Hortencia-Arguello.\n\nThe woman everyone knew as Tencha owned a brothel called Las Palmas that offered minor-aged girls to customers who would pay up to $500 an hour, according to the FBI.\n\nCoincidentally, as a cautionary move, Tencha had distanced herself from Las Palmas by leasing it to Diaz-Juarez.\n\nWhen police found out, they arrested him on a previous warrant.\n\nDiaz-Juarez pleaded guilty in a deal with prosecutors that led to his release several months later. Poncho was back on the loose.\n\nFollowing the money\n\nAuthorities continued to gather evidence in the big sex trafficking case.\n\nWe realized early on that we had potential financial crimes, money laundering involved in the case, so we got the [Internal Revenue Service] involved in it, said Bradley. The IRS began following the money, reviewing bank statements, locating assets.\n\nWe did an estimate on how much she made from the room rental, entrance fee, and the condoms for the whole entire period she was operating Las Palmas and that estimated to be about $12.5 million, said IRS Special Agent Lucy Tan.\n\nWhen it was time for police to move in and raid Las Palmas, 13 people were arrested. Diaz-Juarez wasn't among them. But Tencha was.\n\nTwelve pleaded guilty.\n\nProsecutors charged Tencha with one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, one count of conspiracy to harbor aliens, three counts of money laundering and one count of conspiracy to money launder.\n\nTencha pleaded not guilty.\n\nAnger triggers testimony\n\nWhen Tencha began crying in front of the judge, saying she was innocent and she had no idea what was going on, it stirred something inside the freed women who once worked for her.\n\nThey began to get angry.\n\nOne by one they decided to take the stand and testify against their former captor.\n\nYou didn't have to speak Spanish to see how much pain they had over what had been done to them, and what they had had to do, remembered Bradley. You could just see it in their face, hear it in their voice.\n\nUltimately, the jury found Tencha guilty and the judge sentenced her to life in prison.\n\nDespite the legal victory against Tencha, authorities are disturbed by the fact that Diaz-Juarez remains free.\n\nIt's very important to get Poncho arrested and prosecuted, because he will not stop doing what he does until he is arrested and put behind bars, said Chapuseaux.\n\nLaura, who still fears Poncho, admits she'll feel safer when he is captured. There aren't any words to describe what a terrible person he is.

(Photo by Michael Regan/Getty Images)\n\nStory highlights Real Madrid take on Liverpool on May 26 Champions League final takes place in Kiev Price of flights & accommodation an issue for fans\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe road to Kiev is set to be a weird but not so wonderful one for thousands of Liverpool and Real Madrid fans attending Saturday's Champions League final in Ukraine.\n\nAstronomical costs of flights, accommodation and tickets have forced some to conjure creative ways to get to Kiev this weekend and though it will be an adventure for many, they are far from happy.\n\nFor Gareth Roberts, editor of the Liverpool fanzine the Anfield Wrap, his will be a two-day journey driving through five countries – France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany and Poland – in a coach to reach the Ukrainian capital in time for European football's showpiece event, which starts at 19:45 BST on May 26.\n\nComfort and personal hygiene, he jokes, must be sacrificed to witness the English Premier League side attempt to win a sixth European title.\n\nYet even this cheaper option will set the 41-year-old back £1,000 ($1,345).\n\nThe whole thing has been an absolute joke, the Liverpudlian tells CNN Sport.\n\nWe're leaving Liverpool at 2am Thursday, driving down to Kent, getting on the Eurostar, getting over to France, then it's through Belgium, Holland, Germany – stopping in Berlin – and through Poland into Ukraine.\n\nWe'll stop somewhere else in Ukraine, about 100 miles from Kiev, stay at a hostel, have four hours' sleep, get a shower, then get back and carry on. We think we'll arrive at 8am on the day of the match and the driver wants to be turning around again at 3am.\n\nREAD: Salah wins sixth individual award\n\nREAD: Salah – he's like the Sphinx and the Pyramids\n\nREAD: A day in the life of Mo Salah\n\nPHOTO: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images Liverpool and Real Madrid have been allocated 16,626 tickets each.\n\nAn issue for Britain's Parliament\n\nFans of both clubs have been critical of UEFA, European football's governing body, for allocating 16,626 tickets to each club for an event being held in the 63,000-capacity NSC Olimpiyskiy Stadium, while airlines and hotels have also come under fire for raising the cost of flights and accommodation.\n\nThe issue has even been raised in Britain's Parliament, with Liverpool season-ticket holder and lawmaker Derek Twigg describing the situation as appalling.\n\nPHOTO: Joern Pollex/Bongarts/Bongarts/Getty Images The capacity of the stadium has been decreased from 70,000 to 63,000 for the final.\n\nAs of May 21 on Booking.com, a room for one adult at Hotel Verhovina on May 26 was £859 ($1,155), while staying a night in the same hotel on June 2 would set guests back just £16 ($21).\n\nOn the same website, a guesthouse apartment for one person for May 26 was £4,226 ($5,686). Rooms were unavailable at the time of searching in one of Kiev's plushest establishment, the InterContiental Kiev.\n\nSo expensive is the accommodation that generous Kiev residents have mobilized on social media to offer spare rooms and sofas to fans for free.\n\nMeanwhile, a flight to Kiev from London Gatwick on May 25, returning on Sunday May 27, was £1,214 ($1633) when searching SkyScanner on Monday.

Liverpool had to organize a ballot to allocate tickets to fans.\n\nIt all feels unfair that they (a) can't put it in a bigger venue and (b) in a city that's got better infrastructure to cope.\n\nThere's been rooms advertised on the internet for £10,000 ($13,473). Going in the van is the only way we can do it.\n\nYou only have to go online and type in Champions League tickets and you find them from anything from £500 ($672) to £4,000 ($5382).\n\nEven through UEFA, they were selling tickets for £394 ($530). That's ridiculous. That's not fair pricing. That's a tax on loyalty, a tax on passion for your football team.\n\nWho do you think will win the Champions League?

For example, at the final in 2014 in Lisbon with a stadium capacity of 61,000, the finalists received 17,000 tickets each, the spokesperson said.\n\nDefending champions Real Madrid were allocated 892 fewer tickets for Kiev than they did for last year's final in Cardiff.\n\nThe club says 24,268 season-ticket holders applied for the 12,802 Kiev tickets made available to fans by the club via a lottery but, according to the Independent, more than 2,000 Real fans have returned their tickets because of cost.\n\nFor the fans who planned ahead and had supreme belief in their team, however, they will travel to Kiev at a fraction of the cost of those who waited until the conclusion of the semifinals.\n\nNacho Vignote, a Real season-ticket holder for 18 years, booked his flight and accommodation in September. His confidence is perhaps understandable as this is Real's third final in four years.\n\nPHOTO: Matthias Hangst/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images In 2017 Real became the first team in Champions League history to win back-to-back titles.\n\nVignote's flight from Madrid cost 100 euros ($118) – the cheapest flight departing Madrid on May 25 and returning on May 27 was £466 ($627) on SkyScanner on Tuesday.\n\nHe and nine friends have not had to dig deep for accommodation either as they are renting an apartment for four nights for 1,000 euros ($1,181).\n\nI try to book some months in advance and if Real reach the final then perfect for me and if not it's a nice weekend in a city, he tells CNN Sport.\n\nThis year fewer Real fans have applied for tickets, about four times less. The club is still calling for people on the waiting list because a lot of people have rejected tickets.\n\nThe fans are angry with UEFA for the location they have chosen for the final. The cost is because of the location. If it had been anywhere in central Europe it'd be completely different.\n\nAnd all the tickets are just for VIPs and UEFA. This is a party for UEFA instead of a party where fans can go at an affordable price. The real fans have to either stay at home or spend a lot of money.
By now you may have noticed some extra cash in your paycheck because of the new federal tax law.\n\nBut make sure you're not getting too much of a pay bump — or too little.\n\nWhile the new law lowered most income tax rates, it made a lot of other tax changes too.\n\nTo help you figure out if you're getting the right amount of take-home pay, the Treasury Department and the IRS on Wednesday put out a revised withholding calculator and a revised version of its withholding worksheet.\n\nEither can help you determine whether you're still claiming the right number of withholding allowances on the Form W-4 that you filled out for your employer when you started your current job, got married or had kids.\n\nBut the number you chose at the time may not be the right one for 2018. That's because the new tax law changed the underlying structure on which withholding allowances are based, particularly by eliminating the personal exemption and changing the eligibility for a now-expanded child tax credit.\n\nWhile it would be a good idea for everyone to double check their allowances, it's especially recommended if you have a more complex tax situation. For instance, you have more than one job or an outside source of income, you normally take a lot of itemized deductions, or you and your spouse both work and have a few kids.\n\nFor the most comprehensive assessment, use the calculator.\n\nWithholding issues can be complicated, and the calculator is designed to help employees make changes based on their financial situation, said acting IRS Commissioner David Kautter. Taking a few minutes can help taxpayers ensure they don't have too little — or too much — withheld from their paycheck.\n\nRelated: Here's how much paychecks may go up under the new tax law\n\nThe goal, he said, is to avoid surprises when you file your taxes in 2019.\n\nMost tax filers will want to avoid being under-withheld — meaning the number of allowances you used to take is now too high given the tax law changes. In that case, if you don't reduce your withholding allowances for this year, you'll risk owing money to Uncle Sam when you file your 2018 taxes, or at least not getting as big of a refund as you're used to.\n\nThe IRS suggests people at risk of being under-withheld may include those who itemized their deductions in the past, have two or more jobs in their household, or who have dependents age 17 or over. (Note: most wage earners are over-withheld, meaning they take too few allowances and end up getting a refund come tax time.)\n\nRelated: Tax law, bonuses and raises: 5 things you need to know\n\nTo use the IRS calculator, you won't need to fill out your name or any other identifying information such as your Social Security number. And the IRS says it doesn't store the data you enter.\n\nBut you will need to indicate your marital status, the number of jobs you hold, your gross income and whether your children qualify you to take two child tax breaks, plus other details.\n\nFor help providing those other details, the IRS recommends you have on hand your most recent pay stub and a copy of your last filed federal tax return.\n\nIf you decide to change your withholding allowances for this year, you'll need to resubmit another W-4 form to your employer.\n\n-- CNN's Donna Borak contributed to this story
London (CNN Business) The Bank of England has slashed interest rates to a record low and launched other emergency measures as part of a dramatic and coordinated UK response to limit the economic fallout from the coronavirus.\n\nThe central bank said in a statement Wednesday that while the magnitude of the shock from the coronavirus remains highly uncertain, economic activity is likely to weaken materially in the United Kingdom over the coming months.\n\nA few hours later, UK finance minister Rishi Sunak pledged to do whatever it takes to protect the economy. He announced £30 billion ($39 billion) in tax breaks and additional spending, including targeted coronavirus relief measures worth an estimated £12 billion ($15.5 billion).\n\nThe rate cut follows the Federal Reserve's decision to slash US interest rates by half a percentage point in an extraordinary move last week. The European Central Bank, which meets Thursday in Frankfurt, is expected to push interest rates deeper into negative territory and announce other measures to fight economic damage from the virus.\n\nThe Bank of England said that slashing its main interest rate by half a percentage point to 0.25% would help to keep firms in business and people in jobs and help prevent a temporary disruption from causing longer-lasting economic harm.\n\nRead More

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN Business) —\n\nClifton Broumand has started noticing something is off at the trade shows.\n\nSince 1982, he's been selling medical-grade keyboards and mice produced at his facility in Landover, Maryland, and he's been through a few recessions. Each time, he gets the feeling one's coming when foot traffic seems to be down at the exhibitions he visits to attract new clients.\n\nThis year, he only got half the usual number of leads at an industry conference in Chicago. He knows what happens next.\n\nWhen you start seeing these things, it's like death by a thousand cuts, Broumand says. You see a cut here, a cut there, and all of a sudden it adds up.\n\nMost economic indicators aren't pointing to a downturn on the near horizon. But with seemingly constant chaos in Washington, recent turmoil in the markets and an expansion that's about to be the longest on record, businesses are getting nervous.\n\nIt's notably hard to predict recessions, which are only officially declared well after they've already begun. Eight months into the so-called Great Recession in 2008, many economists were still debating whether the economy was in fact in a recession.\n\nThe fact that the economy is strong right now is no shield against a recession. In fact, recessions typically start when the economy is at its peak and has nowhere to go but down.\n\nMost economists expect slower growth in 2019, but the big question is whether that will morph into a full-blown recession — or if the Federal Reserve can successfully guide the US economy into a soft landing, in which the economy slows but doesn't shift into reverse.\n\nEvery economist has their favorite advance warning system.\n\nBusiness confidence\n\nOne indicator that tends to run well in advance of recessions: The National Federation of Independent Business measure of members' own subjective well-being, known as the small business optimism index. It peaked in the third quarter of 2004, while the American economy was growing faster than it is now, and then started falling until it bottomed out in early 2009.\n\nMore recently, the index spiked after President Donald Trump was elected, reached its highest reading ever in August — and has been sagging since.\n\nSmall business confidence is important because it can determine if those businesses will hire new workers and invest to grow the business, or if they'll start to pull back. And small businesses account for roughly half of the nation's economic activity.\n\nCar sales\n\nBill Dunkelberg, chief economist of the NFIB, keeps an eye on intermediary businesses — anyone who takes orders directly from consumers, and could pick up on any hesitance in the sector responsible for 70% of gross domestic product.\n\nCar dealers are the ones who start to notice, Dunkelberg says. When the car dealer isn't selling, he sends the message up to GM, 'I don't need the cars.'\n\nMotor vehicle sales typically take a turn for the worse at least a few months before recessions officially begin. But recently announced layoffs at GM notwithstanding, car sales have been hovering near historically high levels since early 2015.\n\nWorkers in the auto industry and other supply-chain roles see the signs of a slowdown becoming a downturn even earlier.\n\nWorker hours\n\nA recession may get rolling with a few seemingly anomalous events like the recently-announced GM plant closures. There can also be warning signs in large-scale buyouts, such as those offered to 10,400 Verizon employees a few weeks ago or FedEx buyouts due to a slowdown in trade amid global trade disputes.\n\nBut the more common first step is not being asked to stay late and come in on Saturdays.\n\nWhen manufacturing weakens, the firms wouldn't lay workers off, they would cut back their overtime hours, says economist Ed Leamer, who directs the UCLA/Anderson Business Forecast Project. So far, manufacturing workweeks remain very long by historical standards, after reaching their longest point since World War II in the spring of 2018.\n\nSurprisingly, the low unemployment rate can help accelerate a slide.\n\nThe United States is at what economists consider full employment, with more job openings than workers seeking jobs. But employers unable to find the workers they want are more likely to turn to automation to do the work that they need done.\n\nRising wages, either because of market conditions or increases in minimum wage laws in many states, also makes increased use of automation more attractive. Another factor is the 2017 tax reform, which allows businesses a bigger tax cut on capital spending, such as robots and computer kiosks that can be used by customers, than on new hiring.\n\nThe trouble comes when the economy starts to slow, and it's the workers who are let go, not the machines.\n\nThat's why it can be just a matter of months for a labor market to go from very low unemployment to job losses and a recession, as happened in 2000 and 2001.\n\nThe housing market\n\nHousing has historically been a harbinger of recession — most dramatically in the financial collapse of 2008, which was caused by a real estate bubble fueled by too-easy credit. This time may be different.\n\nHome sales and residential investment have started to sag over the past couple of quarters. But there was no building boom, post-recession mortgage underwriting has been much more solid, and any drop-off in the housing market has been blamed on rising interest rates — as well as high home prices.\n\nStill, home building and real estate accounts for a significant portion of the US economy and a slowdown in housing, for whatever reason, amounts to a slowdown in economic activity, even if it's not the catastrophe of the last recession.\n\nGrowing deficits\n\nMichael Stritch, chief investment officer with BMO Wealth Management, says his clients are mostly concerned that ballooning government deficits may eventually force painful cuts in other areas and lead to political turmoil, even at a time of record corporate profits and low unemployment.\n\nWe don't think it's going to be an acute problem unless people lose faith in the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, Stritch says. It's likely to just eat away at potential GDP growth over time.\n\nThe rising federal deficits, about to crack $1 trillion for the first time, can result in higher interest rates, as the Treasury has to pay more to sell the bonds needed to fund the government. Rising corporate debt can have a similar impact on rates.\n\nAnd the higher bond rates, coupled with the Fed setting its rates higher, can raise the cost of doing business, and the cost of living for households. That in turn serve as a brake on economic growth — especially if deficits are only used to finance tax cuts, rather than priorities like infrastructure and education that would generate a return on the investment over time.\n\nOther pieces of the economy seem more likely to cause a slow drag than to suddenly crater and take the rest of the country with them. Tariffs, for example, have only started to increase prices in a few industries, which may eventually lead to lower orders.\n\nEven though most analysts don't see major imbalances — or bubbles — in the real economy that would internally bring on a recession, every recession is a little different.\n\nAnd this time, it's been long enough since the United States went through a serious downturn that a whole generation of business owners hasn't necessarily experienced one.\n\nFor Clifton Broumand, who's learned through hard experience how to prepare contingency plans as soon as it seems that business might disappear, the fading memories are cause for worry.\n\nA lot of people haven't lived through a recession before, Broumand says. And this is the dangerous part. It's been such a long time, people might not be able to recognize the signs.
First rebate checks sent to taxpayers WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The federal government mailed out nearly 8 million tax rebate checks Friday, the first wave of about 92 million checks that will be sent out in the next 10 weeks. The checks, which go to millions of Americans who filed a 2000 income tax return, range from a maximum amount of $300 for single filers to $600 for married taxpayers who filed jointly. Single parents will get about $500. In order to get the full amount, a single taxpayer must have had at least $6,000 in taxable income for 2000; $12,000 for a married couple filing jointly. The Internal Revenue Service sent letters to those who would receive rebates earlier this month, explaining that the checks are being sent out based on the last two digits of your Social Security number. The rebates that went out beginning Friday were for people with the last two digits 00-09. The distribution schedule continues through September 24. The rebates -- $38 billion worth -- are the product of President Bush's tax legislation that reduced the base income tax from 15 percent to 10 percent. The reduction is retroactive to January 2001, so what taxpayers are getting is a refund of taxes they have already overpaid this year through federal withholding from their paychecks. To celebrate the mailing of the first checks, Vice President Dick Cheney and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill went to a government check-writing facility in Kansas City, Missouri. Friday. Bush joined them via satellite from Genoa, Italy, where he is participating in the G8 Summit. Tax rebate schedule Date mailed Last 2 digits of Social Security # July 20 00-09 July 27 10-19 August 3 20-29 August 10 30-39 August 17 40-49 August 24 50-59 August 31 60-69 September 7 70-79 September 14 80-89 September 21 90-99 Source: Internal Revenue Service Bush said the tax rebates will give families a break and should also stimulate the economy. Beginning late last summer and early fall, our economy, especially the manufacturing sector, began slowing, he said. The combination of this tax relief and lower interest rates should help get it moving again. Not everyone will get a rebate check. Those who did not file a return last year, those who had no taxable income and those who can be claimed as dependents on someone else's tax return will not qualify. The amount of some taxpayers' checks may be smaller, too, if they owe any back taxes, child support payments or federal loan payments. The government will deduct those debts from rebate checks before sending them. So how will you spend your rebate check, if you're getting one? About 47 percent of those questioned for a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll said they would pay bills with the money, 32 percent will save it, 17 percent will spend it and 2 percent will donate their check to charity. If you're undecided about how to spend the money, several stores are ready to help you make that crucial decision. At Wal-Mart stores across the country, people can cash their checks on site or spend the amount in the store against the value of the check. Home Depot stores are offering customers credit, based on the expected amounts of their rebates, until their checks come in. Some analysts say that if people immediately spend their checks, it could stimulate the economy. This is not a one shot deal. This is a down payment on future tax cuts, and I think people would be more apt to spend more of it than they would if they were just handed a one-shot rebate check, said Gerald Cohen of Merrill-Lynch. Others disagree. The problem right now is we're likely to see mounting job losses, and that's likely to erode confidence and induce consumers to save and not to spend, said Anirvan Banerji of the Economic Cycle Research Institute. If you filed your 2000 income tax return late, your check will come after the end of September. And if you moved since you sent in that return, make sure you've filed an official change of address form with the U.S. Post Office. The government says the checks will not be counted as taxable income for the 2001 federal tax returns, but residents of some states may have to pay slightly higher state taxes because of the rebates. One of the states -- Iowa -- has already moved to trim the extra taxes. The others affected are Alabama, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Oregon. The situation came about because in those eight states taxpayers can deduct the amount they pay in federal taxes -- minus any refunds -- thereby reducing their taxable income. But some state officials, believing people will see only that the rebate will mean higher state taxes, fear a backlash from taxpayers who will think the rebate is being taxed. In Missouri the issue will be a subject of discussion at a special session of the legislature in September. Special sessions are being considered in Alabama and several of the other states, and a Montana official said something could be done in a future year to offset this year's slightly higher tax.

Lynne Sladky/Associated Press\n\nThe French Open organizers won't offer special treatment to Serena Williams should she make the trip to Roland Garros in Paris this summer.\n\nThis year again, tournament officials will establish the list and ranking of the women's seeds based on the WTA ranking, the French Tennis Federation said, per the Associated Press (via ESPN.com). Consequently, [the seeds] will reflect this week's world ranking.\n\nWilliams has competed in just two WTA events this year after returning to the court following the birth of her daughter. Because of that, as well as her absence for almost the entire 2017 campaign, she sits No. 453 in the WTA rankings.\n\nBoth Maria Sharapova and Simona Halep lobbied on Williams' behalf for her to earn a seed at the 2018 French Open.\n\nSharapova said returning from pregnancy requires an incredible effort that can tax a player physically and emotionally, while Halep said it's normal to give birth and good to protect the ranking when someone is giving birth.\n\nWilliams won the 2015 French Open and was the runner-up in 2016. Failing to be seeded this season will leave her hopes of a fourth French Open title in serious jeopardy.\n\nVideo Play Button Videos you might like\n\nWilliams received a wild card entry for her return at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California, in March. As a result, she played No. 29 Kiki Bertans in the second round and sister Venus, who was seeded eighth, in the third round. Serena lost to Venus in straight sets. In her next event, the Miami Open, a meeting with fourth-seeded Elina Svitolina awaited Williams if she had defeated Naomi Osaka in the first round.\n\nSomething similar could happen again at the French Open without the luxury of a seeding designation.

The good (or 'let's copy Norway')\n\nBritain leaves the EU, but retains its membership in the European Economic Area, a treaty from 1994 that gives three non-member countries access to EU markets.\n\nThat would give it the same status as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, but it would mean continuing to grant EU citizens the right to live and work in Britain, accepting EU regulations, and making payments to the EU budget -- all things many Brexit campaigners want to end.\n\nRelated: The truth about UK immigration\n\nEven under this scenario, finance officials estimate that the U.K. economy would be about 3.8% smaller after 15 years than it would have been with full membership in the EU.\n\nThat equates to lost GDP worth 1,100 pounds ($1,560) per person, and 20 billion pounds ($28.4 billion) in lost tax revenue.\n\n2. The bad (or 'Canada's pretty cool')\n\nThe second alternative would be to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement with the EU, putting the U.K. in a group of countries that includes Canada, Switzerland and Turkey.\n\nOfficials say the negotiations would be extremely complex, and a free trade agreement would provide less access to the EU single market than Option 1 -- particularly in services, which account for nearly 80% of the U.K. economy.\n\nThe damage under this scenario would be greater: The economy would be about 6% smaller by 2030 than it would have been, equivalent to lost GDP of 1,800 pounds ($2,556) per person. Lost tax revenue would amount to 36 billion pounds ($51 billion).\n\n3. The ugly (or 'Britain joins the BRICS')\n\nIf all else fails, the U.K. could rely on a relationship with the EU based on the rules of the World Trade Organization.\n\nCountries such as Brazil, or Russia (when it's not under sanctions), trade with the EU on this basis.\n\nThis is the only scenario that would free Britain completely from the obligations that come with access to the EU single market. But it would also come at the highest price because of the additional barriers to trade.\n\nOfficials estimate the U.K. economy would be about 7.5% smaller after 15 years than it would have been. That's 2,100 pounds ($2,982) per person in terms of annual GDP, and 45 billion ($64 billion) in lost tax revenue.\n\nBrexit campaigners described the government's report as deeply flawed.\n\nIt also ignores the Treasury's own analysis that EU regulation costs the UK economy much more -- a staggering £125 billion a year, said Vote Leave CEO Matthew Elliott.
You've probably heard by now that the new tax reform bill will hit your paycheck as soon as February. But the change may not accurately reflect your ultimate tax bill.\n\nAbout 90% of people will see more take-home pay, according to the U.S. Treasury. That may sound like great news, but here's the problem: There's a chance you'll end up with too much money in your paycheck -- meaning you'll either be stuck paying it back at tax time next year or get a smaller refund.\n\nThere's also a possibility that too much will be withheld, and your paychecks will be smaller than they should be.\n\nFiguring out how much to withhold from your pay is always a bit of a guessing game. It's an estimate based on how you filled out your Form W-4 and calculation tables created by the IRS.\n\nBut in a rush to implement the new law this year, the estimate could be off more than usual.\n\nThat's because the IRS has updated the calculation tables, but not the Form W-4.\n\nWe've done the best we can in the short term to come up with tables that accurately reflect the tax liability of individual taxpayers. Going forward, in order to be more precise, we're going to need a new system, said a senior IRS official on a call with reporters last week.\n\nA new Form W-4 won't be ready for the 2018 tax year. The new calculations were made to work with the existing form, but the form factors in some deductions and credits that no longer exist or have been changed under the new law.\n\nFor most people, the amount withheld throughout the year is usually more than your actual tax bill -- which means you get a refund after your file your tax return. If not enough is withheld, you end up owing money to Uncle Sam. Generally, you want to get as close as possible to breaking even.\n\nThe new tables may result in under-withholding for some employees.\n\nThose who claim a large number of allowances based on their number of dependents, or on itemized deductions that no longer exist, or are limited by the new law, have the most reason to re-examine their withholding status, said Mike O'Toole, the Senior Director of Publications, Education, and Government Relations at American Payroll Association. The group's members represent 17,000 employers.\n\nBut the changes could also result in over-withholding.\n\nThe good news is the withholdings are within your control. You can always update your Form W-4 to change the amount that's withheld from your paycheck.\n\nHere's what you can expect.\n\nWhen will I see a change in my paycheck?\n\nThe IRS has encouraged employers to start using the new withholding tables by February 15, but it may take your employer longer to make the change.\n\nI can't say that this particular change is appreciably more difficult than in other years. But what will be different is the time pressure and the pressure from employees, who are going to be more sensitive to this, said Jonathan Zimmerman, a partner at Morgan Lewis, who helps employers with benefit plans and payroll matters.\n\nDon't expect your employer to advise you on whether you should change your allowances on the W-4, though. Employers should explain the uniqueness of the situation to workers, communicate when the new rates will be implemented, and then suggest consulting with a tax adviser, according to Mike Boro, a partner at the accounting firm PwC.\n\nHow can I make sure my pay is accurate?\n\nWait for your first paycheck that accounts for the new withholding tables before making any changes, said Barbara O'Neill, a CFP and a financial management specialist at the Rutgers Cooperative Extension.\n\nThen, you can estimate what you think it should be and adjust accordingly.\n\nIRS officials said the agency will be publishing a new online calculator by the end of February that can help you decide how to adjust your allowances based on information you provide regarding your income level and number of children under the age of 17.\n\nBut you can also try to estimate your 2018 tax liability yourself. Then divide that amount by however many paychecks you'll receive this year.\n\nIf the math is close, hang tight, O'Neill said.\n\nIf the math is way off, that's when you'll want to make a change to your Form W-4. You can make a change to the number of allowances you've selected, or you can simply change your allowances to zero and write in how much you want withheld exactly, O'Neill said.\n\nThe changes don't need to be made immediately. O'Neill always recommends taking a look mid-year. By then you'll know if you are receiving a raise or if you'll have additional income coming in during the year.\n\nWhat happens if my withholding is still off?\n\nIf too much is withheld, you'll simply get a bigger refund check after filing your 2018 taxes.\n\nThis amounts to an interest-free loan to the government until then, and could tighten your cash flow, said CFP Jim Guarino.\n\nIf too little is withheld, you could owe money after filing and possibly face a tax penalty if the balance is $1,000 or more, Guarino said. Generally, you can avoid paying the penalty in this case if you paid at least 90% of what you owe or at least as much as you owed during the previous tax year.
That free-wheeling attitude made theco-founder renowned inside and outside of his home country. But it also appears to be putting his business empire — and Ma himself — at enormous risk.\n\nThe trouble started in late October after Ma criticized China's regulators at a conference in Shanghai. As Ma's financial tech firm Ant Group was preparing for the world's largest initial public offering , he accused authorities of stifling innovation and blasted the country's banks for having a pawn shop mentality.\n\nMa, meanwhile, hasn't been seen in public since he gave his speech in Shanghai — a notable absence for a man who typically has no issue with the spotlight, and whose businesses now face their biggest threat in years.\n\nI think there's one overall message that the party is really sending, and that is that tech entrepreneurs may be the most glamorous, the most publicly favorable face that China is showing to the world, said Rana Mitter, professor of history and politics of modern China at Oxford University. But there is no one individual, no one company bigger than the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nMany observers of China say Ma is most likely lying low as authorities turn up the heat on his businesses, having gotten the hint about speaking out of turn.\n\nBut it's also not unlike Beijing to dole out severe punishment for prominent Chinese figures who clash with the interests of the Communist Party.\n\nSuperstar actress Fan Bingbing, for example, abruptly dropped out of sight in 2018 before reappearing a year later to apologize for a tax evasion scandal. And real-estate tycoon Ren Zhiqiang disappeared for several months last year after he allegedly criticized President Xi Jinping's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. He was eventually jailed for 18 years on corruption charges.\n\nA larger-than-life figure\n\nA former English teacher with humble beginnings, Ma has long personified China's economic prosperity and entrepreneurial grit. He built Alibaba into a $500 billion tech empire and amassed a personal fortune of some $50 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index\n\nAs his companies, grew, Ma became the friendly face of China's economic rise. He frequently met with heads of state — Ma has lunched with former President Barack Obama and taken selfies with former UK Prime Minister David Cameron — and last year even donated Covid-19 supplies around the world.\n\nMa's style as an executive at Alibaba was unabashedly flamboyant , too: Once, he sang the 1950s classic  Unchained Melody  on stage at a company conference, often dressed up in costumes and appeared at events with celebrities like David Beckham and Nicole Kidman.\n\nJack Ma performs at Alibaba's 20th-anniversary celebration in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China in 2019.\n\nOn one level, Chinese authorities liked that Ma represented a high-powered and glamorous version of China because one of the things the Chinese Communist Party has found it almost impossible to do is to create soft power in the world, said Mitter, the Oxford professor.\n\nTencent TCEHY Baidu BIDU The government has encouraged the growth of its home-grown tech giants, including Alibaba, Ant Group,and, while shutting out their big American rivals. They're all largely indispensable in China for social interaction, entertainment, commerce and more.\n\nBut authorities in China increasingly view that outsized influence as a risk to the country's political and economic stability . Ant Group, for example, is able to collect lending fees free of the tough regulations imposed on commercial banks.\n\nThe squelching of the big name tech entrepreneurs is part of that wider process by the party to take back control, and really rewrite the narrative of how China's tech innovation takes place only under the circumstances the party will allow, Mitter said.\n\nIn recent months, the government's steps to rein in the industry have gotten more blatant. The Communist Party published an unusually frank set of guidelines in September, for example, that called on its members to educate private businesspeople to weaponize their minds with [Xi's] socialism ideology.\n\nIn the weeks since then, that tightening of the screws has come to pass. In addition to the regulatory demands for Ant Group and investigation into Alibaba, authorities have warned other tech representatives against creating monopolies and abusing consumer data for profit\n\nThe last of his kind\n\nMa, a Communist Party member, remains out of sight. His social media pages have been dormant since October, and he even missed the finale of an African entrepreneurial talent show that he created. (Alibaba said he missed the event because of a  scheduling conflict .)\n\nWhile Beijing hasn't been shy about fining or even jailing executives critical of the government — Ren, the real estate tycoon who was imprisoned last year, allegedly penned an essay that obliquely referred to Xi as a power-hungry clown — tech industry and government observers say Ma may be voluntarily staying out of the spotlight, at least for now.\n\nThe Chinese government wants its narrative about the Ant Group IPO to dominate the public conversation, said Duncan Clark, author of Alibaba: The House that Jack Ma Built and founder of investment advisory firm BDA China. He added that the company likely knows that it won't help to have any diversity of opinion on the issue.\n\nBut certainly it's remarkable ... the silence is somewhat deafening, Clark said, adding that he expects Ma to eventually come out publicly with a scripted statement about contributing to reform in China.\n\nHe got the signal that 'I spoke too much, that caused me trouble so I need to shut myself up', said Angela Zhang, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong who has studied Chinese antitrust enforcement.\n\nLoss of 'soft power'\n\nOne thing, at least, seems clear: As the Chinese Communist Party piles pressure on the country's tech titans, it seems unlikely the industry will see another figure like Ma. Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang, who succeeded Ma as chairman in 2019, struck a conciliatory tone on regulation in November by describing the government's efforts to tighten restrictions on internet companies as  timely and necessary .\n\nThe loss of that kind of voice, though, will have consequences for Beijing, Mitter said. Many countries, particularly in the West, already view China and its businesses as existential threats worthy of heavy sanctions and scrutiny — tensions that stem from fears that Chinese corporations all operate at the behest of the Communist Party. Stifling criticism from those tech leaders at home could make exerting influence abroad even harder.\n\nThe ability of a figure like Jack Ma to speak out will be harder, and I think this will actually create a further problem for China's desire to generate soft power, Mitter said. Nobody really takes seriously figures from any country who go around the world simply spouting the government line.
Dean camp condemns bin Laden ad\n\nCommercial attacks candidate's national security credentials\n\n(CNN) -- Democratic presidential hopeful Howard Dean's campaign called on rivals Wednesday to disavow a television ad that uses an image of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to attack the former Vermont governor's national security credentials.\n\nA group calling itself Americans for Jobs, Healthcare and Progressive Values aired the ad in the early Democratic battlegrounds of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n\nHoward Dean just cannot compete with George Bush on foreign policy, an announcer intones over a magazine cover featuring bin Laden's visage. It's time for Democrats to think about that, and think about it now.\n\nDean's campaign manager, Joe Trippi, called the ad the kind of fearmongering attack we've come to expect from Republicans, one that panders to the worst in voters.\n\nHe called on Dean's rivals to condemn the ad and demand it be pulled off the air.\n\nThis type of ad represents everything that is wrong with our political process today -- polluting our airwaves with smears on other candidates that have nothing to do with legitimate policy differences, Trippi wrote in a letter to his counterparts in other campaigns.\n\nAds like this are the reason that less than half of the voting population in America bothers to go to the polls.\n\nThe group was founded in November as a nonprofit committee known as a 527 -- named for the section of the tax code that limits its requirement to disclose the source of its funding.\n\nIts leadership includes two people with ties to Dean's Democratic rivals -- David Jones, a former aide to Rep. Dick Gephardt, and Robert Gibbs, a former spokesman for Sen. John Kerry's campaign.\n\nJones issued a statement Wednesday saying the ad was meant to raise the issue of Dean's national security and foreign policy experience.\n\nThat is the ad's intention and that is what it does, he said.\n\nIn a Tuesday conference call with reporters, Gephardt denied any knowledge of the ad and called on the group to disclose its donors.\n\nI wish they weren't running the ads, he said. I'm sorry they're doing this, but there's nothing I can do about it. But I would call on them and any other 527s to reveal their donors in a timely manner.\n\nBut a spokesman for Sen. Joseph Lieberman, who has hammered Dean's opposition to the war since the weekend capture of fugitive Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, echoed its criticism while denouncing its tone.\n\nWe agree with Joe Trippi that this ad is produced and presented in a way that is over the top, said Brian Hardwick, Lieberman's deputy campaign director.\n\nBut we also agree that it's exactly the kind of ad that Republicans would run. And that's precisely the problem. Simply put: The Democratic nominee will not win in 2004 if he appears weak on defense.\n\nIn August on Larry King Live, Dean deflected criticism of his opposition to the war. I think it's great that Saddam Hussein is not in power, but I would have approached it in a very different way, he said.\n\nAfghanistan, he said, deserves more attention, because the alliance between al Qaeda and the Taliban was an issue for the national security of the United States.\n\nPresidential hopeful Howard Dean. The ad attacks his anti-war stance.\n\nThis past weekend, Dean called the capture of Saddam, a great day of pride in the American military and a great day for the Iraqis and a great day for the American people.\n\nThe 527 committee's funding has come in part from labor unions, but a spokesman for one of those unions disavowed the spot Wednesday.\n\nIf it was up to me, I'd ask for a refund, said Rick Sloan, communications director for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which donated $50,000 to the group.\n\nThe union has endorsed Gephardt, the Missouri congressman and former House minority leader. But Sloan said the union did not discuss the commercial with Gephardt, and said it could backfire big time.\n\nI think this has done more damage to Gephardt than any of his opponents ever could have done. The day after the primary or caucus, the Democrats have to go back to living with each other and working with each other, Sloan said.\n\nThis kind of attack ad just drives them crazy, and rightfully so. It makes the job of pulling back together all that much harder. I don't know what they were using for brains -- lug nuts?
Bitcoin and four other cryptocurrencies surgerd on Thursday, with the approach of tax day in the United States.\n\nBitcoin jumped 10% in just one hour, adding nearly $1,000 and surging above $7,000 for the first time since Sunday.\n\nOther popular cryptocurrencies including Ethereum, Litecoin and Dash, made double-digit gains as well, ending a month-long sell-off.\n\nCryptocurrency experts say there are several factors driving the rally, but the most significant is April 17, the deadline to file taxes in the United States.\n\nRyan Taylor, CEO of Dash Core, which provides software used by Dash traders, said that investors are jumping back into the cryptocurrency market at the end of a tax-related sell-off. He said they've been unloading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in recent weeks to pay their looming tax bills. But with tax day, April 17, rapidly approaching, most of these investors have paid their tax bills, he said, and some investors have received tax returns that they're spending on cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe selling pressure associated with tax day has subsided right now, said Taylor. As people get their tax returns, there may be new money entering the market.\n\nRelated: What is bitcoin?\n\nIt appears that investors are warming back up to bitcoin after a dramatic slump that's been dragging down prices since they peaked at $19,086 on Dec. 17, 2017.\n\nNolan Bauerle, director of research for CoinDesk, a company that tracks cryptocurrency activity, said that short selling has dried up dramatically just since Wednesday, when 44,000 short positions were open for bitcoin. He said that number dropped to 26,000 short positions on Thursday.\n\nThere was definitely a short squeeze, said Bauerle. We do know that this huge volume of short positions closed up simultaneously to that spike in price.\n\nGarrick Hileman, co-founder of the cryptocurrency research firm Mosaic, said that in addition to the end of tax season related selling and the short squeeze, the surge in digital currency might also be driven by heightened geopolitical tensions.\n\nHe said that President Trump's rhetoric about bombing Syria might be contributing to the cryptocurrency rally.\n\nCoinDesk's Bauerle said the threat of war and other threats of instability, like the Brexit vote in 2016, have driven the price of cryptocurreny in the past.\n\nWe have noticed the trend of bitcoin acting as a crisis currency, he said.

(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini)\n\nThe UK government is attempting to justify flagship legislation that critics say would hand the police and ministers powers that could seriously curb the ability of citizens to protest at a very difficult time. The legislation is being debated in Parliament just days after officers from London's Metropolitan Police forcefully broke up a peaceful demonstration mourning the death of a young woman, Sarah Everard.\n\nEditor's Note: Jane Merrick is a British political journalist and former political editor of the Independent on Sunday newspaper. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nOn Tuesday evening, members of Parliament voted in favor of preventing the UK exiting the European Union without a deal. On Wednesday, MPs voted to give the Prime Minister just three days to come up with an alternative plan if, as expected, her own carefully negotiated deal, is rejected by the Commons next week.\n\nAfter a series of bruising defeats last month, it seems the Prime Minister is starting the New Year continuing to be thwarted by a parliament trying to exert its sovereignty.\n\nAnd yet, as MPs prepare to begin a five-day debate ahead of that vote on the May deal next week, we are no closer to discovering what MPs actually want.\n\nWe know, after Tuesday's vote, that there is a majority in favor of blocking a no deal. But there is little evidence of a majority in support of anything else – not May's Brexit plan, nor an alternative Norway-style model for a future relationship with the EU, nor for a second referendum to allow the country to reject Brexit altogether.\n\nCrucially, the attempt to block a no deal is, on closer scrutiny, flawed – because without an alternative, no deal is the default, no matter what Parliament says. If May's plan is voted down next week and no other plan is put forward, Britain is leaving the EU without a deal, on the starkest of terms. The May plan is more than just a plan – it is a legal withdrawal agreement with the EU.\n\nIt is right that, after months of the government trying to force an unpopular version of Brexit on the Commons, MPs try to scrutinize the process of Britain's departure as much as they can. Originally, May had tried to force Parliament into accepting her plan without a meaningful vote before that plan was even finalized with Brussels in November.\n\n02:12 - Source: CNN As Brexit deadline looms, protests turn nasty\n\nWhen the vote was slated for December, she postponed it, to the anger of MPs from all parties who suspected she was trying to run down the clock and make her deal a fait accompli by not allowing enough parliamentary time for a debate on any alternative. Brexit is happening on March 29, in 79 days – but in parliamentary terms, the timeframe is much tighter because of weekends and breaks, and there are only around 40 days left for debate.\n\nYet despite this obstructive approach from May and her government, the House of Commons has been confused over what the alternative should be. MPs need to have a better, more constructive plan than simply opposing a no deal.\n\nBut the truth is there is no consensus around an alternative, an incontrovertible fact in keeping with the divisive nature of Brexit. What's more, while the withdrawal agreement negotiated with the EU needs to be ratified by the UK parliament – as well as all the other EU nations – it is not in Parliament's gift to amend that deal.\n\nAny changes they demand over the next few days and weeks need to be approved by Brussels. And, given the withdrawal agreement came after months of hardball negotiation with the EU, it is unlikely Brussels will give any substantial ground. Above all, Brussels will not move on one of the key demands of Brexiteers, that the Northern Ireland backstop be removed from the agreement.\n\nEven the technical procedure which MPs used to try to block a no deal, by amending the Finance Bill – a keystone of government legislation – could have dramatic real-world implications, because it means if a no deal does actually take place, the government's tax-raising powers will be restricted.\n\nIt is healthier for democracy that that meaningful vote will take place next week. But, if as is likely, the Prime Minister loses that vote and her plan dies, there needs to be a hardheaded and urgent alternative strategy ready to go, and the Commons needs to find a consensus.\n\nIf MPs get their way, they could force May to return to Parliament within three days of that vote with an alternative. But even then, this alternative must be approved by the EU. In this current Brexit stalemate, the UK Parliament may think it is sovereign, but ultimately it is the EU which retains the whip hand.
IRAs are a powerful tool for retirement savers to get lucrative tax breaks to help them reach their long-term financial goals.\n\nWhen it comes to safety and security, IRAs are as safe as you make them, and although some regulatory protections safeguard your retirement accounts, it's up to you to invest your IRA assets prudently. By using a smart strategy for your investing, you can ensure that your IRA will be as safe as possible while still achieving its underlying purpose.\n\nHow regulators protect your IRA\n\nIRAs get the same regulatory protection that applies to the investment vehicle you use to open your retirement account. For instance, if you invest your IRA in a bank certificate of deposit or savings account, then you'll receive interest in the same way a regular banking customer would, and your IRA will have the full protection of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's $250,000 deposit insurance.\n\nFor those who use brokerage accounts to invest, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation offers protection of up to $500,000 for securities and cash, including a $250,000 cash limit. IRAs get the same protection as other brokerage accounts. But it's important to understand that while FDIC insurance actually protects your principal from risk of loss, SIPC insurance only protects you against problems with the brokerage company you use. When a broker gets into financial trouble and has to liquidate, SIPC makes sure the assets in each investor's account are present and accounted for. If cash or securities are missing, then the SIPC makes investors whole, up to the dollar limit protected.\n\nWhat the SIPC doesn't do is to prevent you from suffering market losses. If you buy a stock and its value goes to zero, don't look to the SIPC to bail you out, because it won't.\n\nManaging risk with your IRA investing\n\nTo keep your IRA safe, you'll have to take a smart approach to your investing decisions. There are several things you can do to try to balance the returns that your IRA investment portfolio can produce against the risks that you face anytime you invest.\n\nFirst, diversifying your portfolio across several different types of investments can help you avoid catastrophic losses if one of your holdings suffers a setback. Diversification can take many different forms, such as holding many different broad asset classes including stocks, bonds, real estate, and alternative investments. It can also mean selecting several different options within a particular asset class, such as buying stocks in various sectors to offer more broad-based exposure.\n\nSecond, be aware of your time horizon. If you're already in retirement, then you'll generally want to be somewhat more conservative in your investing philosophy, because you're in a less favorable position to endure market downturns that could hurt the value of your portfolio.\n\nBy contrast, if you have decades to go before you need to tap your retirement assets, then investing your IRA in more aggressive investments can produce the best returns over the long run.\n\nFinally, make sure you acknowledge some of the risks that many investors neglect. Being conservative with your retirement account can minimize the risk of market losses, but being too conservative comes with the attendant risk that inflation will erode the purchasing power of your retirement nest egg and keep you from being financially secure when you retire.\n\nSimilarly, selecting investments that come with higher management fees creates the risk that even if your return on investment is good, the net value of your nest egg at retirement could still be insufficient due to the thousands of dollars in inflated fees that your financial institution took out of your IRA over the course of your career.\n\nSponsored Content from The Motley Fool:\n\n• 5 Years From Now, You'll Probably Wish You Grabbed These Stocks\n\n• Kansas Man Turns $10,000 into $8 Million\n\n• Shark Tank Just Revealed a Trillion-Dollar Idea\n\nIRAs are extremely valuable for retirement investors, and you can do your part to make them as safe as possible. Although you can't eliminate IRA risk, you can manage it effectively and still reach the financial goals you set for yourself.
As if filing taxes weren't stressful enough, one aspect of the process that really shakes workers to their core is the prospect of getting audited.\n\nStatistically speaking, your chances of getting audited are pretty low, as less than 1% of all returns land on the IRS's list each year.\n\nThat said, in preparing your tax return, you could end up making certain moves that increase your audit risk without realizing it. Here are a few that could subject you to further IRS scrutiny.\n\n1. Rushing through your taxes\n\nSome people wind up filing their taxes at the very last minute because they're forced to wait on key information or are at the mercy of their CPA friend who's supposed to be helping out. But in many cases, folks who end up sweating it out right around the deadline are those who simply procrastinate.\n\nEither way, you should know that rushing through the process is a good way to inadvertently increase your audit risk, since, in doing so, you're more likely to omit key information or enter the wrong data.\n\nA better bet? Pledge to start tackling your tax return a minimum of one month prior to the deadline, which falls on April 17 this year. That's right — you get a couple of extra days, which means you have even less of an excuse to run out of time.\n\n2. Filing on paper\n\nIf you're the old school type, you may decide to file your taxes on paper this year rather than do so electronically. Bad move. Filing on paper means you're far more likely to make a mistake, and if that happens, your return could land on that audit list faster than you can say whoops.\n\nConsider this: The IRS reports that the error rate for paper returns is 21%, which means that one in five tax filers who go this route manages to muck something up. The error rate for electronic returns, on the other hand, is less than 1%. Remember, we're all human, and therefore subject to the occasional blunder. But if that slip-up results in an IRS audit, you'll be kicking yourself for not doing everything possible to lower your risk.\n\n3. Guessing at numbers -- even if you're close\n\nIf there's one thing the IRS is big on, it's accuracy. So as you sit down to file your taxes, make sure you're dealing with hard numbers. Guessing at data or deductions is a great way to raise your audit risk, and it doesn't matter if you're reasonably close — the IRS wants those numbers exact. This means that if you did freelance work last year but are missing that 1099 form that summarizes your income, don't just throw out a number you think is correct. Get on the phone with that client, insist on a copy of that tax form, and get that figure just right.\n\nSimilarly, if you lost a 1099, contact the issuer and find out what exact number that document contained. Remember, every time you get a 1099, the IRS receives a copy as well, and if your return doesn't match its records precisely, you'll automatically boost your audit risk.\n\n4. Being careless with deductions\n\nThe IRS offers a host of deductions that, if you're itemizing, could lower your tax burden significantly. But proceed with caution when claiming deductions, because if you don't, the IRS might choose to take a closer look at your return.\n\nFor one thing, avoid round numbers unless your deductions happen to work out that way. If you racked up, say, $6,966 in medical expenses, don't claim $7,000 for convenience purposes. Not only is that technically a lie, but having too clean a number, so to speak, will likely raise an eyebrow.\n\nFurthermore, try to avoid claiming disproportionately high deductions relative to your income. While it's one thing to list $5,000 in charitable contributions with a $60,000 income, if you claim a $15,000 deduction, it's apt to look suspicious. Of course, if you're looking at an exceptionally high deduction that's perfectly legitimate, by all means, claim it — just be sure to have meticulous documentation to back it up, because chances are, the IRS will ask for it.\n\nRelated links:\n\n• Motley Fool Issues Rare Triple-Buy Alert\n\n• This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997\n\n• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market\n\nWhile plenty of taxpayers get audited for reasons other than these, avoiding these mistakes could help you stay off that dreaded list.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe blue wave, powered in large part by voters who said they did so in opposition to the President, means the House is full of new Democratic members with a firm mandate to attack Trump frequently.\n\nPHOTO: CNN Errol Louis\n\nAlready, incoming freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan told supporters that Trump's days are numbered because We're going to impeach the m*****f****r. And when her comments sparked a furor, she declined to apologize and her office released a statement that read, The Congresswoman absolutely believes he needs to be impeached. She ran and won by making this very clear to the voters in her district, the statement said.\n\nTrump has already responded to the jibe, calling it disgraceful before turning to Twitter to attack Democrats. He wrote, They only want to impeach me because they know they can't win in 2020, too much success!\n\nWhether impeachment proceedings will actually take place is a question perhaps best left to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nPelosi has so far downplayed talks of impeachment, although the option certainly remains on the table. We have to wait and see what happens with the Mueller report. We shouldn't be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn't avoid impeachment for a political reason, she told NBC.\n\nResponding to Tlaib's comments, Nadler said on CNN, I don't really like that language. But more to the point, I disagree with what she said. It is too early to talk about that intelligently. We have to follow the facts, we have to get the facts. That's why it is important to protect the Mueller investigation, that's why it's important to do our own inquiry. We have to get the facts. We will see where the facts lead. Maybe that will lead to impeachment. Maybe it won't. It is much too early.\n\nBut even if impeachment is currently on hold, a criminal indictment could theoretically lead to severe financial penalties or even imprisonment – something no president has ever faced.\n\nOn the hot-button question of whether a president can be indicted while in office – a matter on which constitutional scholars disagree – Pelosi said on NBC that she doesn't consider Trump immune from criminal prosecution.\n\nWhen reminded that internal Justice Department memos advise against the idea of prosecuting a sitting president, Pelosi said I do not think that that is conclusive. She later added, I think that that is an open discussion. I think that is an open discussion in terms of the law.\n\nNadler went a step further when he told CNN's Jake Tapper in early December, I disagree with the Office of Special Counsel and the Department of Justice. There is nothing in the Constitution that prohibits the President from being indicted. Nobody, not the President, not anybody else, can be above the law. There's no reason to think that the President should not be indicted.\n\nWhether an indictment would guarantee impeachment, however, is another story. Nadler said, There are several things you have to look at. One, were there impeachable offenses committed, how many, etcetera. And secondly, how important were they? Do they rise to the gravity where you should undertake an impeachment?\n\nRegardless of whether the House initiates impeachment proceedings, Pelosi now has a great deal of power to make Trump's life miserable – both legally and politically – as the leader of a Democratic-led House with the power to hold hearings, subpoena witnesses and dig into Trump's tax records. And she knows it.\n\nBefore her colleagues even voted to make her the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi let President Trump know that his days of dominating the national political agenda with bluff, bluster and bullsh** have come to an end.\n\nWhen asked whether she thought Trump deals with her differently because she's a woman, she said, I have no idea. We'll see how he will deal with the speaker of the House. … I hope he recognizes that a new day has dawned in America.\n\nIt's unclear whether Trump has grasped the full meaning of the new environment in Washington. For the past two years, as special prosecutor Robert Mueller has racked up indictments, convictions and guilty pleas from Trump associates, the President has defended himself with a key assist from Republican members of Congress.\n\nSeveral of the more outspoken members – whom Trump calls his warriors – have acted as political bodyguards by publicly attacking Mueller, calling for criminal prosecution of former FBI Director James Comey and appearing on right-wing media outlets to argue Trump's case.\n\nWhat a difference an election makes.\n\nFor the moment, talk of these grave legal matters is still hypothetical. We still haven't seen Mueller's findings and it will take a considerable amount of time for Pelosi, Nadler and other Democratic leaders to hire staff, hold hearings and begin playing catch-up on investigations that began years ago.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAnd a decision about whether to indict Trump is one that's up to the Department of Justice, which has a long-standing view that presidents are immune to criminal prosecution during their terms in office.\n\nBut the talk from Pelosi and Nadler about being open to the idea of indictment is a warning to the White House: The days of Congress defending the Trump administration at every turn have ended. And new political and legal problems for the President could just be beginning.

Aired 11a-12p ET\n\nAired December 15, 2018 - 11:00 ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n[11:00:44] ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning. I'm Alex Marquardt, in for Fredricka Whitfield this Saturday. Thanks for joining us.\n\n\n\nWe are following a number of breaking stories this morning.\n\n\n\nFirst, the Trump administration losing yet another cabinet member. Just moments ago, the President announced on Twitter that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has resigned and will leave the administration at the end of the year. Zinke departs amid growing scrutiny over a number of ethics investigations during his time heading up the Interior Department. We will have much more on Zinke's resignation in a few moments.\n\n\n\nBut right now we move on to our other breaking story of the morning -- the future of health care for millions of Americans is once again up in the air.\n\n\n\nA federal judge in Texas striking down Obamacare, a controversial ruling that is setting the scene for a major legal battle ahead. This could once again leave the fate of President Obama's landmark health care law in the hands of the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nNow the Texas judge's decision centers round the individual coverage mandate which requires all Americans to get health insurance or pay a penalty. Congress effectively eliminated that penalty as part of the 2017 tax cut bill. Now the judge is saying that mandate is unconstitutional. So the entire law, he says, is invalid.\n\n\n\nMany states in reaction are vowing to fight back and appeal that calling the ruling an assault while President Trump who campaigned vociferously against Obamacare is taking a victory lap on Twitter touting that new ruling.\n\n\n\nSo for more, we are joined by our Supreme Court reporter, Ariane de Vogue.\n\n\n\nAriane -- break this down for us. Obamacare, signing up for that ends at midnight. Millions have signed up for Obamacare for 2019. But this really will not affect -- will not immediately affect them? ARIANE DE VOGUE, CNN SUPREME COURT REPORT: Right, it won't. But this\n\n\n\nis a really broad ruling. This judge said not only is the individual mandate unconstitutional. He said the entire law must go.\n\n\n\nNow it's just one judge right, Reed O'Connor --\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nDE VOGUE: It can be appealed on this. But boy, it sends into doubt the future of a lot of people thinking about health care. He said it can remain in effect pending appeal.\n\n\n\nBut let me walk you through just a bit the history of it --\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Yes.\n\n\n\nDE VOGUE: -- so we understand how we got to today. Remember back in 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate. Remember it was Chief Justice John Roberts, he said it was ok under the taxing power.\n\n\n\nFlash forward to 2017, Congress acts to get rid of the tax penalty. So this judge last night says, look, you got rid of the tax penalty. That's the legal underpinning of this Supreme Court opinion. So now, not only is the individual mandate unconstitutional, but everything else must fall. That is a huge win for critics of Obamacare.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And as you and I were discussing right before the show this goes well beyond what the Trump administration had even wanted.\n\n\n\nSo game this out for us. It will go through an appeals process but it could make its way to the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court has now shifted dramatically since the last ruling. So how does this all play out?\n\n\n\nDE VOGUE: Well, first of all, remember, the Trump administration they've declined to defend this law. So California and a group of other states, they stepped in and last night they said we are going to the Fifth Circuit. That's a very conservative federal appeals court in Texas.\n\n\n\nSo the Fifth Circuit will look at it. And if it upholds exactly what O'Connor did then this thing will shoot right to the Supreme Court because that's so broad. The Fifth Circuit could scale back a little bit and so maybe it wouldn't go to the court. But the court likes to hear things when they are big. national laws like this.\n\n\n\nWe do have this new, solidified, conservative majority but we also might have a concern about what is called severability, really kind of jibes by knocking down one provision, take the whole thing. That might be at issue at the court, too. So they will have to look at it if it gets to them.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: A lot of moving parts. But the important part to remember is nothing changes immediately --\n\n\n\nDE VOGUE: Right.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: -- but it is once again in jeopardy.\n\n\n\nDE VOGUE: Yes.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: So a lot of drama ahead probably.\n\n\n\nAriane de Vogue -- thanks so much for joining us and explaining that.\n\n\n\nDE VOGUE: Thank you.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: All right. Well, the Affordable Care Act was, as we mentioned, one President Obama's biggest achievement while in office. This latest ruling threatens to wipe away the protection for people with pre-existing conditions, as you just heard from Ariane\n\n\n\n[11:04:59] That is a major staple of the law which was widely featured in the 2018 midterm campaign on both sides among Democrats and Republicans.\n\n\n\nSo joining me now is one of the architects of Obamacare, Jonathan Gruber. Jonathan -- thanks so much for joining us this morning.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, what is your reaction to this ruling out of Texas?\n\n\n\nJONATHAN GRUBER, ARCHITECT OF OBAMACARE: Well, I think it's really disappointing. I mean essentially a perversion of representative democracy.\n\n\n\nRepublicans controlled the Congress. They had a chance to strike down Obamacare. They said no, we are going to leave Obamacare and strike down the tax penalty. So they have literally said it is severable. Republicans have spoken. They said it's severable.\n\n\n\nYet, this judge is saying, no, I don't believe what the representative democracy delivered. I'm going to declare it unseverable.\n\n\n\nSo that's why legal experts, even legal experts who were opposed to the Affordable Care Act in previous cases are saying this is just ridiculous.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And the judge did say that because the individual mandate is unconstitutional, the whole law is as well. That mandate as we know is what they called as central and inseverable, as you were just discussing, from the remainder of Obamacare. So do you agree?\n\n\n\nGRUBER: Well look, I think when the law passed we all thought the mandate was a very important part of the law. We have now basically been proven that it's important but not as important as we thought because look, we now have experience of the law without it, they removed the mandate. And we are seeing it weakens the law, it raises premiums, but the law still remains quite strong, albeit not as strong as it would have been.\n\n\n\nSo we have seen empirically that the law -- that it is severable. The law still works without it. Congress in its wisdom has declared that it's severable, has said, look, we're going to keep the law but remove the mandate penalty.\n\n\n\nSo really there is just no basis for a judge in Texas to just say despite what the body that represents the American people have said, I'm going to decide this is not severable. There's just no reason to do it.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Are you confident in the appeals process that this won't go any farther?\n\n\n\nGRUBER: No, I'm not confident. Previous cases on the Affordable Care Act have all been clearly, by an objective standard, easy wins for the Affordable Care Act, and yet they've all passed by the skin of their teeth.\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court clearly does not represent the constitutional expertise of the broad Senate constitutional experts, who for example in 2012 by about an 80 percent to 90 percent margin said the mandate was constitutional. Yet the Supreme Court found it wasn't.\n\n\n\nSo I'm nervous. What's fortunate is the Supreme Court I think does care about the opinion of the American people. The American people have spoken. They believe that protecting people with pre-existing conditions against insurance market discrimination is a key contribution of this law. And indeed it is.\n\n\n\nAnd I think hopefully the Supreme Court will see that that's something that matters to people. And that because of some obscure severability clause --\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nGRUBER: -- Or lack of severability --\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nGRUBER: -- they will not go against the will of the Congress.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: You say you are nervous. At the same time you say that the Supreme Court listens to the will of the American people. But now we have a Supreme Court that has two new conservative justices in Gorsuch and Kavanaugh on it. So if this makes its way to the Supreme Court, do you have any sense of how you think they might rule or how the whole court would rule?\n\n\n\nGRUBER: I honestly don't. I just hope that they will look and realize that even without the individual mandate, we are talking about a law that provided insurance to 17 million people, and for the 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions, it's saying don't worry, if you lose health insurance you can go buy it on the exchange.\n\n\n\nIf this law goes away, we return to a day where people who are sick can't get health insurance, which defeats the whole purpose of the product.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: All right. Jonathan Gruber -- thanks so much for joining us this morning. GRUBER: You bet. >\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: All right. Joining me now is NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell, and assistant editor at the Washington Post and CNN political commentator David Swerdlick.\n\n\n\nDavid -- let's start with you. Protecting those with pre-existing conditions was a focal point of the midterm campaigns and did help Democrats take back the House. What do you think are the political consequences of this ruling?\n\n\n\nDAVID SWERDLICK, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: So, good morning -- Alex.\n\n\n\nI think the political consequences are that Republicans have now basically done the equivalent of playing Jenga. They pulled the bottom block out of something hoping it will collapse. It's not going to go away yet because as your previous guest has said it's going to have to go up to the Supreme Court probably to resolve this.\n\n\n\nBut if the Affordable Care Act eventually does fall apart, then you have a divided Congress that's not going to be able to agree on how to proceed with health care and that will leave millions of Americans who depended on the Affordable Care Act sort of in the lurch.\n\n\n\nDemocrats are moving left toward Medicare for all. Republicans have been unable to pass their plans, which are a version of, you know, market-based health care where states can choose what kind of plans they have. The two sides are far apart.\n\n\n\n[11:10:02] I don't think Democrats in the immediate future are going to be able to deliver on this because they don't have the Senate. And I think Republicans are going to have to answer in the coming months why they want to take this apart if they don't have a plan in place that can replace it that's clearly better.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And Kelsey -- picking up on that, the soon-to-be House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi has slammed this ruling. Is there anything that she can do?\n\n\n\nKELSEY SNELL, CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, NPR: Well, she is very capable for bringing up bills to vote on her Congress at this point so that the House could potentially take a vote and uphold portions of the law or even bring back the penalty for the individual mandate that was zeroed out by Republicans last year.\n\n\n\nBut I think it's very important that this is a big political issue for Pelosi. She firmly believes and has strong evidence for the fact that Republicans lost many, many congressional races in states like New Jersey and in Florida and California based on messaging on the Affordable Care Act because voters really started to like this law.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nSNELL: They may not like it being branded as Obamacare but they really do like the protections that are in the law.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nDavid -- a point that I have been trying to get at with some of our guests is --\n\n\n\nSWERDLICK: -- if we play this -- if we game this out and it gets to the Supreme Court and now you have the Supreme Court that is firmly conservative with the nominations of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh -- how does that impact things? Because the Chief Justice John Roberts was the key vote, the key voice last time and now you've got solid five to four conservative majority. So how is that going to affect things?\n\n\n\nSWERDLICK: Yes. No -- I think we're going to -- it's a little bit of a wait and see. I mean this Texas federal judge has a reasonable if not ultimately winning point that if the Supreme Court in 2012, you know, premised its upholding of the Affordable Care Act on the idea that this was part of Congress's taxing power but now the law does not include the penalty or the tax then that premise is gone.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the idea I think Ariane was talking about the severability problem earlier in your program -- the problem is does this make the entire law fail. And you know, I can't get into the minds of the Supreme Court justices, including Justice Roberts who is a conservative Bush appointee who's the chief justice, but who I think in 2012 clearly saw what would happen if the Supreme Court intervened to essentially undo the will of Congress. So I have to go with wait and see right now -- Alex.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Wait and see it is.\n\n\n\nAll right. Well, he have a lot more to discuss. David and Kelsey -- please stay with us.\n\n\n\nWe're going to take a quick break.\n\n\n\nStill ahead, turmoil inside the White House. Just after President Trump names Mick Mulvaney as his acting chief of staff, his Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke steps down amid several ethics investigations.\n\n\n\nWe will be live from the White House, next.\n\n\n\n[11:12:45] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: President Trump has lost yet another cabinet member after naming an acting chief of staff. In a tweet this morning the President announcing the resignation of his embattled Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. Trump tweeting that Zinke is stepping down and will leave his administration at the end of the year. Zinke was under growing pressure over a number of ethics enquiries.\n\n\n\nThe President has also announced on Twitter that Mick Mulvaney will become the acting chief of staff at the end of the year. Mulvaney will also somehow continue in his job as the director of the Office of Management and Budget, the OMB.\n\n\n\nSo for more let's bring in CNN's Sarah Westwood at the White House. Sarah -- Zinke was in trouble because of all these investigations but his departure didn't seem imminent, did it? Why did all this happen today?\n\n\n\nSARAH WESTWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, Alex -- Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is someone whose fate within the administration had been was unclear for several months now given some of the headlines that he's generated in the White House responding to those by saying they'd look into the problems facing Zinke but the timing of his departure comes amid a massive staff shake-up across the West Wing in the cabinet.\n\n\n\nNow Zinke had been embattled for weeks now. He was facing a number of probes from the Department of Interiors inspector general over allegations that he used his post to enrich himself, that he perhaps had a relationship with the chairman of Haliburton that was under investigation. His dealing in a casino project in Connecticut also being looked at by the agency's inspector general. Abuse potentially of agency resources.\n\n\n\nAnd CNN reported in October, that the Department of Justice was looking into some of the Zinke's conduct after the inspector general referred some of its work to the Justice Department.\n\n\n\nNow, Zinke's departure does perhaps prevent some headaches for this White House because now he won't really be in a position to be dragged before Congress. Democrats had been vowing to bring him in to ask him questions about some of these scandals -- Alex.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Sarah -- switching over to Mulvaney for a second, he has been named acting chief of staff, emphasis on the acting. And somehow he is going to do that incredibly difficult and time-consuming job while also holding on to his job as the head of OMB?\n\n\n\nWESTWOOD: That's right. That's what this administration says, although the day-to-day work will be taken over by a deputy. It won't even be the first time Mulvaney is pulling double duty. He also took over as head of the CFPB earlier in the Trump president -- something that was a little controversial at the time.\n\n\n\nBut the President is accepting Mulvaney in this position, in an acting capacity is a remarkable shift from just a couple of weeks ago when the President ultimately wasn't able to come to an agreement with his first choice for the position, Nick Ayers, Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff, because Ayers wanted to hold it on a temporary basis as well. But the President is suddenly ok with having an acting chief of staff to fill this vacancy -- Alex.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: All right. Sarah Westwood at the White House. Thanks for breaking that all down.\n\n\n\nSo back with me to discuss more are David Swerdlick and Kelsey Snell.\n\n\n\nKelsey -- Sarah was just hitting on the point that I wanted to start with you, the fact that the first choice for chief of staff, Nick Ayers, who is Vice President's Pence's chief of staff. [11:20:05] The reason those talks broke down is because he wanted the acting title and Trump didn't. So why do you think he's accepted it with Mulvaney? Is it just to sort of quash any perception that no one wants the job?\n\n\n\nSNELL: It may just be that because, as you know, there have been other candidates who have said no or who have been turned down since Ayers decided that this wasn't the job for him. Like Mark Meadows --\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nSNELL: -- the Freedom Caucus chairman. And you know, it may also be to put a little bit of ease with people in Congress because Mulvaney has an odd relationship with folks up there, particularly with Democrats.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Congressman for six years.\n\n\n\nSNELL: He was. And there are Democrats who are already out there saying that Trump is picking Mulvaney because he wants to have a bigger shutdown fight and that's something that Mulvaney has always been a kind of a critic of government spending and he was one of the Republicans who always fought to keep spending limited. So it's entirely possible that he is trying to calm the waters.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And he's a true partisan and true supporter of the President so it's unlikely that he's going to be that middle ground, that moderating diplomat with Democrats on Capitol Hill.\n\n\n\nSNELL: That is not the expectation that people have for the type of chief of staff that we would see from Mick Mulvaney.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: David, to you -- like many Republicans the President's new acting chief of staff has not had kind words for the President in the past, specifically before the 2016 election.\n\n\n\nAnd overnight there's new video that we found of Mulvaney before election Day and in it Mulvaney actually explains why he is reluctantly supporting Trump. Let's take a quick listen to that and we'll talk on the other side.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nMICK MULVANEY, OMB DIRECTOR: Yes, I'm supporting Donald Trump. I'm doing so as enthusiastically as I can, given the fact that he's a terrible human being. But the choice on the other side is just as bad.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: He's a terrible human being. I wonder if the President has actually seen that piece of video. Assuming he does at some point, do you think that Mulvaney will actually become the permanent chief of staff?\n\n\n\nSWERDLICK: No idea. But -- and I haven't seen that video yet -- Alex. But I have two reactions to it. One is that even though it's a little more blunt than most would put it, in some ways I think that is an articulation of the bargain that a lot of Republicans in Congress and a lot of Republican voters made with President Trump in 2016.\n\n\n\nThat they didn't think he was great on issues of personal character or comportment but they preferred him to Secretary Clinton. They liked his agenda and they wanted a Republican in the White House with a Republican Congress so they made that deal and they went with them and now here they are.\n\n\n\nAnd now here Congressman Mulvaney or rather Director Mulvaney is now. He's a loyal Trump soldier now, served as OMB director, CFPB as Sarah just reported.\n\n\n\nHe's got the right resume but I agree with what Kelsey said to you a minute ago. The fact that you have to take him on an interim basis just shows how much people don't want this job.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Kelsey -- when you hear -- to David's point -- that people don't want this job and yet you see the President saying that many people wanted this job, which is true? Are people actually lining up to try to be the chief of staff in this White House at this time?\n\n\n\nSNELL: Not as far as we have seen. There are some people who enjoyed having their names out there or were, you know, were not discouraging that conversation --\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nSNELL: -- about their candidacy. We haven't seen a lot of people come forward. It would be a very difficult job. We have seen that through the number of people who have gone through it already.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Very difficult because we have the Democrats coming in to taking over the House, and we're at possibly the end of the Mueller investigation. So this is a White House that's under fire.\n\n\n\nSNELL: Yes, this is a time when things are about to get a little bit stickier.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: All right. David, back to you -- how could Mulvaney help Trump navigate this Russia investigation. We've seen a number of events this week with regards to Michael Flynn and Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. So there is a sense that Robert Mueller might be wrapping things up in the early months of next year. How do you think Mulvaney is going to help with that?\n\n\n\nSWEDLICK: You know, I think at a minimum, he knows Congress as a former member of Congress so he can at least help the President with the ins and outs of the committee process even if he, as Kelsey said earlier, is not on the best of terms with all the Democrats in Congress. That's the book on Mulvaney.\n\n\n\nHe has a fresh start here, right. With some bad blood brewing between the President and General Kelly. The President didn't have confidence in Reince Priebus, his first chief of staff. So at a minimum, he's able to turn the page and say ok, where do we go from here, fresh start?\n\n\n\nBut the President is looking at the Mueller investigation coming to a conclusion perhaps sometime in the next few months. The President is looking at a situation where he's already done a tax cut into a full employment environment. So if there's a recession, let's say, what stimulative things can he approach Congress with at this point? It is going to be a tough sled for any chief of staff for any White House in this next Congress, I think.\n\n\n\n[11:24:54] MARQUARDT: And Kelsey -- with Mulvaney coming in as acting, that is kind of plugging one hole in the boat but at the same time, you've got John Kelly widely respected, leaving. You now have Ryan Zinke leaving under this cloud of ethics investigations. That, of course, follows Scott Pruitt and Tom Price.\n\n\n\nI mean how battered does the White House become with these two high- profile departures after this long string of other departures?\n\n\n\nSNELL: Well, this is not necessarily something that's going to calm critics down. It's also not a situation that makes it any easier on the Senate because they are going to have to confirm replacements for Zinke --\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nSNELL: -- and for another attorney general.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nSNELL: This has been very difficult for them to get through controversial nominees. We've seen a lot of nominees get through on very narrow votes. We've seen the Vice President have to break more ties his than several of his predecessors combined.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right.\n\n\n\nSNELL: So this is creating a serious backlog and a serious issue for the White House in the very beginning of next year.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: So much to discuss, we could spend hours on it but unfortunately we have to go.\n\n\n\nKelsey, David Swerdlick in New York -- thank you so much.\n\n\n\nComing up, interview showdown. Sources telling CNN that the special counsel's team continues to be interested in sitting down with the President, but will the President give in?\n\n\n\n[11:26:03] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: The special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation still wants a face-to-face meeting with President Trump, but the President's lawyers are saying a sit-down interview is not going to happen. The development follows a new slam by Robert Mueller involving General Michael Flynn, the former national security advisor. The special counsel is dismissing suggestions by Flynn's lawyers that\n\n\n\nhe lied to the FBI because he was set up. The memo caps a head- spinning week of revelations that shows the legal walls are closing in on Trump and the people around him.\n\n\n\nThese are the current active investigations in and around Trump's orbit. Take a look at this. The Trump campaign, the Trump transition team, the Trump inaugural committee, the Trump Foundation, and the Trump Organization and, of course, the Trump administration itself.\n\n\n\nCNN's Erica Orden is following all of this. Erica -- let's start with Michael Flynn. This was a fascinating moment because both sides, the Flynn legal team and the Mueller legal team had said that Michael Flynn deserves no jail time because of his extensive cooperation. Now we see the Mueller coming out swinging saying that Michael Flynn's version of the facts is untrue and he should have known that lying to federal investigators is against the law.\n\n\n\nERICA ORDEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right. So, as you pointed out, one of the important things to keep in mind is that both sides have asked for little to no prison time for Michael Flynn. However the prosecutors had been pushing back against some of Flynn's claims.\n\n\n\nAnd one effect that all of this may have in terms of the sentencing is that the judge has brought up in his court filings and, you know, you've seen the judge order prosecutors and lawyers and from the special counsel's office to file additional material in response to some of those claims.\n\n\n\nSo what you may see during sentencing is the judge seek to elicit more information on some of these issues from both sides -- from Flynn's attorneys and from the special counsel team.\n\n\n\nAnd you may see the judge enquire with Flynn and with his attorneys about why Flynn is bringing up some of these -- some of these claims right now just before -- just prior to his sentencing.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: So how do you think that actually plays into the sentencing which is on Tuesday? Flynn could face up to six months. I understand his legal team has asked for probation. They've offered 200 hours of community service. But given that Flynn has now clearly irked the Mueller folks, does that make it more likely that he could face some prison time?\n\n\n\nORDEN: He does seem to have irked them but given again that both sides have asked for little to no prison time, and that the Mueller team has gone into detail about -- although some of it has been redacted in court filings -- has gone into detail about Flynn's level of cooperation and his willingness to assist the special counsel investigation. It doesn't seem likely that these kinds of claims will substantively change the ultimate sentence for him.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And of course, the major question, what did Michael Flynn actually tell the prosecutors in more than 62 hours of conversations about President Trump.\n\n\n\nEric Orden -- thanks so much for breaking that down for us.\n\n\n\nORDEN: Thanks .\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: So for more, let's bring in Elie Honig who is a former federal prosecutor and state prosecutor.\n\n\n\nMueller says that this won't change his recommendation, that Flynn will receive no jail time. So Elie -- what does this tell us about Mueller's process and what were Flynn's lawyers doing calling out the FBI in the first place in that sentencing memo?\n\n\n\nELIE HONIG, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Yes. I do not think this will change Mueller's recommendation of no jail time. I think -- but I do think Flynn's lawyers overstepped here. They went down a road that they didn't need to.\n\n\n\nTheir guy was perfectly situated to get a no jail time sentence.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right. That was the defense recommendation. That was Mueller's recommendation. It was a done deal.\n\n\n\nI don't know why they poked this bear. They did not need to. And the arguments they're making are silly. They are not correct as a matter of law. They're not correct as a matter of common sense.\n\n\n\nThe FBI has no obligation to tell someone in this situation that they ought to get a lawyer because the interrogation was not in FBI custody. So that's different from like a Miranda setting. The FBI did not have to warn Michael Flynn, hey if you lie to us, that's a crime.\n\n\n\nAnd by the way of all people who should know that it should be the incoming national security adviser. So I don't know why the lawyers went down this path. I don't see any benefit to it for Flynn.\n\n\n\n[11:35:01] Now the judge has shown some interest, as you said before -- Alex. And I don't -- that could mean either thing. That could meant the judge is thinking about throwing the case out. I don't think that's likely. It could mean that the judge on the opposite side is ticked off and think that Flynn has not truly accepted responsibility now which could result in a slightly higher sentence.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Right. Let's just remind our viewers what happened is that Flynn was questioned by FBI agents, that those FBI agents did not tell him explicitly that lying to the FBI is illegal.\n\n\n\nHONIG: Right.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And the Mueller's team response was someone who spent this much time heading up an intelligence agency in the military at this highest level of U.S. government should know that.\n\n\n\nSo Elie -- Flynn was one of the first people in Trump's inner circle to cooperate extensively as both his team and the Mueller have said at the highest level. He was cooperating. He was part of the campaign. He's part of the transition. He's part of the administration. Does it looks like this is a test case for other potential cooperators?\n\n\n\nHONIG: It could be. Look, I always approach cooperators from the point of view that the other potential cooperators are watching. And that's why I think Mueller has been smart.\n\n\n\nThe cooperators who have come through, who've been honest, who've been truthful, who've given him good information he's gone to bat for. Michael Flynn being one of them.\n\n\n\nThe cooperators who have messed around and played games and stretched the truth he's thrown out. Papadopoulos, right, Mueller put in a very negative sentencing memo on Papadopoulos. And of course, Paul Manafort who Mueller threw out of the prop room altogether. And now Manafort is looking at an extremely high sentence.\n\n\n\nSo I think there is important messages to be sent which is if you cooperate and you do it right and you do it fully and you do it truthfully you will get a benefit. But if you come in here and play games it's going to back fire.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And Elie, now this news that the special counsel says he still wants to interview President Trump on the Russia investigation. Of course, his lawyers have pushed back and say they are opposed. They don't want to do that.\n\n\n\nHere is what President Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, said about the President's truthfulness. Take a listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS ANCHOR: The special counsel did say that you were doing your best to tell the truth about everything related to their investigation, everything related to Russia. Do you think President Trump is telling the truth about that?\n\n\n\nMICHAEL COHEN, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY: No.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: So very simply, is it in President Trump's interest to sit down with Robert Mueller?\n\n\n\nHONIG: No, if I was representing the President I would fight that at all costs. But there's two ways this can go. They can agree to terms of an interview between Mueller and Trump's team. I don't think that will happen because I don't believe Trump lawyers are willing to walk him into a room with Mueller and let him answer questions.\n\n\n\nAnd if not then the ball moves over to Mueller's court, is he going to issue a subpoena? And if he does, we're going to end up in the courts and we're going to have I think a very close contest up to the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And if he issues a subpoena, of course, that is to be approved by Mueller's bosses -- Rod Rosenstein, the acting attorney general Matt Whitaker until there's actually a new attorney general. So it's unclear whether that subpoena would actually come into effect.\n\n\n\nBut Elie -- the last question to you. The Trump entities as we highlighted at the top there are under investigation across the board. It does feel like to some extent that the walls are closing in on the President. What does it mean for Trump legally, personally himself? Should he be scared at this moment more so than in the past?\n\n\n\nHONIG: He should. He's got exposure on various levels. Let's start with I DO think it's unlikely that the Department of Justice indicts the sitting president. There is existing DOJ guidance saying that DOJ will not do that.\n\n\n\nThat said there are plenty of people very close to the President, including potentially relatives of his who could be in criminal legal jeopardy. And he's going to have all manner of civil problems. The Trump Org is going to have to deal with all sort of civil lawsuits as well. So yes, I wouldn't be resting easy by any means.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: All right. Elie Honig, always appreciate your expertise.\n\n\n\nHONIG: Thanks -- Alex.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: Thanks for joining us. >\n\n\n\nAll right. Up next, we're going to hear from the family of a 7-year- old migrant girl who died in U.S. custody. And what U.S. officials are saying about how exactly this tragedy happened.\n\n\n\n[11:38:59] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: A protest is planned this afternoon in El Paso, Texas after a 7-year-old migrant girl from Guatemala died in U.S. custody. She was detained with her father in a remote part of New Mexico on December 6th. Officials say she was medically cleared to be taken to a detention facility with the rest of her group which included another 50 unaccompanied children.\n\n\n\nThe next day she got seriously ill and was airlifted to a hospital where she went into cardiac arrest and died a short time later. An autopsy is being performed, but an initial hospital report says that the girl died of septic shock.\n\n\n\nFor more let's bring in CNN's Ed Lavandera who is in El Paso. Ed -- what are we now hearing from the girl's family?\n\n\n\nED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, they are simply devastated. We've been able to reach the family in Guatemala, the extended family and mother and grandfather who spoke about how devastated and horrified they are by the news of what has happened to this young girl.\n\n\n\nThe grandfather of Jacqueline spoke with us -- our CNN colleagues from CNN Espanol who were down in Guatemala speaking with them. And this is what they had to share. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nDOMINGO CAAL, GRANDFATHER OF GIRL WHO DIED IN U.S. CUSTODY: I'm not going to speak that much because I can barely take it. It's difficult for us. This happened because we are very much in need. The girl would jump in happiness that she would get to go to the United States, very happy and content. But she didn't know. For us it's very difficult.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\n[11:45:02] LAVANDERA: The family talked about how it was desperation that drove them to make that long journey. And of course, there has been a great deal of debate about the very trek that they made.\n\n\n\nTrump administration officials have been very critical of the father in particular for, quote, choosing to cross illegally into the United States. That has been pushed back on very intensely from immigrant rights activist, especially here in El Paso who say it's the Trump administration's policies and immigration stance that is driving many of these people to cross into the country illegally.\n\n\n\nThis father and daughter were part of a large group of migrants who had crossed into a border checkpoint in the far remote areas of western New Mexico. This was hundreds of miles from many things where they would have been able to provide quick medical care in this situation.\n\n\n\nSo a great deal of debate and a lot of finger-pointing as to how all of this could have happened -- Alex.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: One of the disturbing things, Ed, in this whole story is that this happened more than a week ago so why did it take so long for this to come to light?\n\n\n\nLAVANDERA: That's a big question, you know. And there has been a number of critics who really kind of fault the transparency or the lack of transparency on the part of the Trump administration.\n\n\n\nEl Paso Congressman Beto O'Rourke basically faulted the Department of Homeland Security for not being transparent enough. The leader of the Customs and Border Protection testified before Congress on Tuesday several days after this young girl had passed away and made no mention of this particular case.\n\n\n\nSo there is a great number of criticism of the administration for essentially having to count on a news report to break thins story and bring it to light.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: All right. Ed Lavandera in El Paso, Texas -- thanks so much.\n\n\n\nNow, remember the deadly shooting at a high school in Parkland Florida back in February? The panel investigating the attacks now wants a new law allowing teachers to carry guns. Details and reactions coming up next. [11:47:09] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: This week we saw a new controversial push to put guns in classrooms to try to avoid tragedies like the Parkland massacre. It's been ten months since 17 people, 14 of them children, were gunned down at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\n\n\n\nNow the school safety committee formed after that shooting has voted to recommend a state law be passed that allows teachers to be armed with guns. Those teachers would have to volunteer and undergo a background check.\n\n\n\nNow, this comes as a new report from the CDC shows that nearly 40,000 people were killed by guns last year. That's the highest number since at least 1979 when firearm deaths were first recorded -- 40,000.\n\n\n\nJoining me now is CNN correspondent Polo Sandoval. Polo -- what can you tell us about this recommendation to arm teachers?\n\n\n\nPOLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, first off, Alex -- that commission is certainly still remembering those 17 people whose lives were cut short, their families continue to grieve today and they likely will the rest of their lives.\n\n\n\nBut for the last eight months, members of the commission that was appointed to try to come up with a solution has been meeting trying to figure out a way of preventing something like this from happening again.\n\n\n\nAnd what's interesting here is that is a majority of them, about 14 of the 15 members of that panel all came to an agreement in the last few days. And all of them believe that perhaps the solution is to allow more teachers to carry weapons in the classroom.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nBOB GUALTIERI, PINELLAS COUNTY SHERIFF: Such as participating on the threat assessment teams.\n\n\n\nSANDOVAL: The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission is recommending teachers be allowed to carry guns on school campuses. The controversial proposal part of a 407-page preliminary report. It addresses failures by Broward County law enforcement during the massacre as well as recommendations on how to counter future school violence.\n\n\n\nChairing the commission, Pinellas County sheriff Bob Gualtieri who supports the measure.\n\n\n\nGUALTIERI: We have to give people a fighting chance so we've got to give them an opportunity to protect themselves in my view. We don't have enough to put cops in every school or multiple cops in every school and we're not maximizing the use of the guardian program. and one person, one good guy with a gun on every campus is not adequate.\n\n\n\nSANDOVAL: The proposal has yet to go before the governor or state lawmakers. If approved, teachers who want to carry would be required to go through training and background checks before arming themselves.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Here's the issue -- districts and schools need to act now.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They need to act now. They need to act now.\n\n\n\nSANDOVAL: Currently only some teachers and school staff are allowed to carry firearms. Since the Parkland shooting, at least 14 other states have introduced similar measures. The changes have been met with some support in states where rural communities lack funding and resources to respond to a school shooter.\n\n\n\nMax Schachter is the only person on the advisory commission opposing the arming of Florida teachers.\n\n\n\nMAX SCHACHTER, PARENT: I don't think teachers should be carrying guns. I think they have enough on their plate. I think their priority is teaching. It just creates a lot of host of problems.\n\n\n\nSANDOVAL: With the recommendation still tentative, more debate is likely about how to face a school's worst nightmare.\n\n\n\nGUALTIERI: What we got right now isn't working. So we need to do something differently.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\n[11:54:54] SANDOVAL: And though this measure has large support within that public safety commission, there is a plenty of opposition outside of it, particularly some of these pro-gun reform groups, including Every Town for Gun Safety, a volunteer with that group strongly condemning it.\n\n\n\nAlex -- I want to read you a small portion of the statement that he published the week following the release of this draft report. Gay Valemont (ph) a volunteer with this group, writing There is no evidence that arming teachers makes kids safer. He went on to write Our children deserve real solutions to keep them safe from gun violence, like a criminal background check on every gun sale.\n\n\n\nSo even though this is still a draft report, still has to go to the governor, Alex, still also has to go to legislators, this obviously is still making for quite a bit of debate there in Florida to try to keep something like this from happening again.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: And of course this is the kind of policy that the President has trumpeted numerous times --\n\n\n\nSANDOVAL: Right.\n\n\n\nMARQUARDT: -- after this horrific massacres that we've seen.\n\n\n\nPolo Sandoval, thanks so much for that report. All right. Still ahead, a federal judge has struck down the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare marking a win for President Trump but potentially putting the health care of millions of Americans in jeopardy.\n\n\n\n[11:55:59] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
A Message of Discontent from Wisconsin (TIME, April 17, 1972) -- Like some metaphysical lottery, with hazards of sudden political death or prizes of resurrection, the American primary system ramshackled through Wisconsin last week to the end of its first phase -- and a pause before the next series, starting April 25, in such crucial industrial states as Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. The Wisconsin primary left the eventual outcome of the long spring campaign more enigmatic than ever, but some of the election results were startling: -- George McGovern, hitherto regarded as a one-issue antiwar champion of the liberal-left, exploited his own superb organization in the state, tapped deep wells of economic discontent and, by winning a 30% plurality, transformed himself at last into a major candidate. In Wisconsin his support was astonishingly broad, bracketing liberals, conservatives, blue- collar workers, farmers, suburbanites and the young. -- George Wallace, with the help of 35% of the G.O.P. voters who crossed over to vote Democratic, similarly appealed to a restive mood of the little man. Although he campaigned for only eight days in Wisconsin, Wallace came in second, with 22% of the vote. Adding the Wallace and McGovern totals, 52% of the voters cast ballots for anti-Establishment candidates. -- Minnesota's Hubert Humphrey, who had counted on his longtime popularity in neighboring Wisconsin to catapult him into the Democratic lead, came in third, with 21%. It was a serious, though by no means fatal blow for Humphrey, who has yet to win a presidential primary. -- Edmund Muskie, limping into fourth place with only 10% of the vote, was the real loser. Once regarded as the front runner, Muskie's defeats in Florida and Wisconsin have deflated his trust and confidence campaign. In an almost breathtaking descent, Muskie in a matter of weeks has become merely another contender. At least one candidate did not survive Wisconsin at all. New York Mayor John Lindsay, with a dismal 7% showing on top of his 7% in Florida, declared himself out of the race. A Muskie aide who had earlier called Lindsay the wild card in this campaign remarked last week: He turned out to be a deuce. Washington Senator Henry Jackson, who won 8% in Wisconsin, remained the darkest of horses, suffering from a massive problem of nonrecognition; on primary day last week, his workers were still distributing a leaflet headlined WHO IS SENATOR JACKSON? On the Republican ballot, Richard Nixon was opposed by Ohio's conservative Congressman John Ashbrook, who got 1% of the vote. California's liberal Republican Congressman Paul McCloskey, who had already withdrawn from the race, also got 1%. The President scored 97%. The Wisconsin campaign was a furious montage of political styles. With mod glasses and carefully darkened hair, 61-year-old Humphrey bounced through 19-hour days. We can sleep next year, he told his workers. Everywhere, except among college students, he found deep affection, but the warmth did not always convert to votes. At times, his campaign savored of last hurrah. In Milwaukee, a woman wearing a McGovern button told H.H.H.: We love you. But you're voting for McGovern, replied Humphrey. Said the woman: Yes, but we love Hubert Humphrey. George Wallace planned only a minimal campaign in Wisconsin, where busing was not an issue, and he had virtually no organization. But when he sensed the crowd's mood at his first rally in Milwaukee on March 23, Wallace abruptly changed his schedule. Suddenly all his earlier explanations about our inability to rent halls because of basketball games became academic. Wallace sought his little man with eleven rallies in eight days and a flurry of local television interviews. He repeatedly brought up busing as a philosophical issue. He complained that the other candidates were horning in on his populist issues: I dig the bone up and throw it out there, and the big dogs grab it. I'm just a little dog from Alabama. McGovern's television commercials confirmed the Wallace complaint. If you want lower property taxes, you want George McGovern, said one. It's as simple as that. But McGovern emphasized direct campaigning. In oblique reference to Lindsay's stylish and futile TV campaigns in Florida and Wisconsin, one McGovern press release claimed: The day of the media candidate is over. People have stopped watching television commercials and started listening to details. Top-Heavy. Despite his efforts to sharpen his stand on issues, Muskie failed to come across clearly on any topic. His organization, top-heavy with endorsements and contributors, never took root on the local levels where primaries are won. He failed to define a constituency. The overall message from Wisconsin is of a contrary mood, an impatience with more traditional candidates and a deep undercurrent of economic dismay. Most specifically, Wisconsin signaled a massive discontent with taxes and inflation -- the pocketbook issues that McGovern and Wallace hit the hardest. In a study of TIME, the attitude research firm of Daniel Yankelovich Inc. found that four of the five top issues that influenced Wisconsin voters were economic. The sixth was the Vietnam War, and McGovern made that into an economic issue as well, emphasizing its continuing costs. According to the survey, 82% of those interviewed said that the Administration's wage and price policies are not working. Fifty-two percent called for overall tax reform, with 41% complaining about high prices and 36% about high unemployment. McGovern and Humphrey both hammered away on the issue of tax reform, of giving the little taxpayer and the working man a fairer break. They shared the rewards: well over half of McGovern's voters and almost two-thirds of Wallace's assailed tax loopholes. The issue cut across both party and ideological grounds, attracting liberals as well as conservatives, Republicans as well as Democrats. The Yankelovich pollsters found a surprising degree of second-choice support for McGovern among the Wallace voters -- support rooted in McGovern's broad anti-Establishment campaign. It was not that Wisconsin voters were running to ideological extremes at the expense of centrist candidates, but rather that both McGovern and Wallace seem to have located an authentic area of concern that the other candidates failed to articulate. Significantly, the survey found that voters still saw Centrist Humphrey as the Democrat with the best chance to be nominated and, if nominated, to beat Nixon. According to the TIME/Yankelovich survey, McGovern trailed both Wallace and Humphrey among blue-collar workers and union members, but he still got 25% of their votes. More than any other, McGovern came through as someone you can trust. Improbably, he won the Fourth Congressional District, on the blue-collar and ethnic south side of Milwaukee, with the largest concentration of Poles in the state. Muskie, who had emphasized his Polish ancestry, finished fourth. Cross-Overs. Wallace and McGovern worked the same vein of economic distress, but the McGovern vote was moderate-liberal, according to the survey, while the Wallace vote was essentially moderate- conservative. McGovern fared well with young voters (47%); Wallace did poorly. The final results were complicated, of course, by the fact that 26% of the votes cast in the Democratic primary came from Republicans and Independents. The cross-overs cost Humphrey a second-place finish, since most of them went to Wallace. Yankelovich found, however, that most of the cross-overs came not as spoilers but as voters anxious to make their views known on the economy and other issues. Wisconsin served to prolong and compound the suspense of the race. It established the major Democratic theme -- a profound economic disgruntlement -- but not a party leader. It's kind of a scramble now, Humphrey said last week. Coming out of Wisconsin, Muskie still led in committed delegate votes, with 96 1/2. McGovern, gaining 54 in Wisconsin, had a total of 89 1/2, trailed by Wallace with 75 and Humphrey with 19. With the delegate-rich primaries in Pennsylvania (182), Massachusetts (102), New York (278) and California (271) still to come, all the candidates are still far from the 1,509 needed for nomination in Miami Beach. For the moment, Wisconsin seemed to have reduced it to a three-man contest among Muskie, Humphrey and McGovern. Although McGovern now ranks as a heavyweight contender, he must still establish that Wisconsin was not a fluke in which the candidate was secondary to the issues. McGovern displayed surprising strength among labor's rank and file in Wisconsin, but his comparative radicalism and long anti-war record have earned him the hostility of many labor leaders as well as Democratic professionals. If McGovern begins to seem a serious threat, many of the regulars might mount a counterattack in favor of Humphrey. Some Democrats fear that a McGovern candidacy might be the equivalent of Barry Goldwater's campaign in 1964 -- an ideological debacle -- and they are already poor-mouthing his victory on the grounds that his excellent Wisconsin organization and Republican cross-over votes distorted the natural outcome. Scenarios. These primaries, said McGovern last week, are going to go on from state to state, from battle to battle. His most optimistic scenario now is to win Massachusetts, where his liberal following is strong, on April 25, then Nebraska on May 9, run well enough (meaning third behind Humphrey and Wallace) in Michigan on May 16 and then go on to take Oregon, California and New York. For Humphrey and Muskie, April 25 will be critical. That is the date of both the Massachusetts and Pennsylvania primaries. Humphrey, badly needing a victory, will count on his support among organized labor for a win in Pennsylvania. Despite Wisconsin, Humphrey's camp insists that McGovern is not really a factor -- This is a race between Humphrey and Muskie. McGovern's advisers, meantime, regard Muskie as a political corpse, seeing the race as a head-on collision between McGovern and Humphrey. Muskie had planned to run in Pennsylvania against Humphrey and in Massachusetts against McGovern, to regain momentum. Last week, however, his advisers were discussing a stop-Humphrey ploy with McGovern's forces -- Muskie would concentrate on winning in Pennsylvania while leaving Massachusetts to McGovern. With each future contest, the political equations will change and the pressures increase. It is now highly likely that after all the bloodshed of the primaries, no one will go to Miami Beach with a lock on the nomination. If so, it will be a fascinating week in July. A deadlock would probably eliminate McGovern as too leftward and experimental, even though that might provoke a fourth-party rebellion. Humphrey might also be unacceptable: too much like 1968...a loser's image. That might leave Muskie as a reconciliation candidate. Or is it possible, as some politicians have already begun to fantasize, that stalemated delegates from all factions of the party will send up a cry from the floor: Kennedy! Kennedy! Success at Last for George I believe the people of this country are tired of the old rhetoric, the unmet promise, the image makers and the practitioners of the expedient. The people are not centrist or liberal or conservative. Rather, they seek a way out of the wilderness. So said Senator McGovern as he officially hit the campaign trail 15 long months ago -- and all but disappeared into the political wilderness. As the earliest declared candidate for the presidential nomination in recent memory, he had a plan: challenge Edmund Muskie before he built up an insurmountable lead, go all out to make a credible showing in the New Hampshire primary, and then, gathering momentum, overtake the field in Wisconsin. Back then, his strategy seemed dreamy, if not downright doomed. Few political leaders took his candidacy seriously, dismissing him as a self-appointed conscience of the party or a stalking horse for Ted Kennedy. The Margin. The professional polls had clearly underestimated George Stanley McGovern, 49, child of the plains, minister's son, college-debate champion, World War II bomber pilot, former history professor, father of five and, according to Robert Kennedy, the most decent man in the Senate. Decency and doggedness -- traits that served him well when he first ran for Congress in 1956, traveling the dusty side roads for one-to-one meetings in farmhouses and general stores. Taken singly, the encounters were insignificant; taken together, they meant the margin of victory. Recalls Journalist Harl Andersen, who covered the campaign for the Associated Press: George only builds a stone at a time. After a while, though, it begins to show up. In 1962 he moved on to the Senate, winning a seat by only 597 votes. One of the earliest and most persistent antiwar Senators, McGovern began building a small but strong following with his co- sponsorship of the 1968 McGovern-Hatfield resolution calling for an end to the war. Though unsuccessful, the legislation occasioned a rare flash of fire from the quiet man. Every Senator in this chamber is partly responsible for sending 50,000 young Americans to an early grave. McGovern fumed. This chamber reeks of blood! When Robert Kennedy was assassinated, McGovern sought to keep Bobby's antiwar supporters together by entering the race in his stead less than three weeks before the 1968 convention. Though he polled only 146 1/2 of the 2,622 delegate votes, the effort gave McGovern the presidential bug. The candidate of 1972 has changed little; he is still the personable but plodding campaigner. McGovern's success is a combination of his persistence and a new, high-powered, appealingly unprofessional organization. Without the aggressiveness of Bobby Kennedy or the aloofness of Eugene McCarthy, McGovern has forged a coalition of followers from both camps. On one flank are such Kennedy men as Advisers John Kenneth Galbraith and Arthur Schlesinger Jr., former Kennedy Press Secretaries Pierre Salinger and Frank Mankiewicz, Writers Richard Goodwin and Adam Walinsky. (His principal financial contributors are Max Palevsky, chairman of the Xerox Executive Committee, and Henry Kimelman, board chairman of West Indies Corp.) On the other are legions of young staffers and student volunteers bristling with go-for-George enthusiasm. The spectacle of the old Kennedy pros followed by McGovern's young crusaders, says Eugene McCarthy, is like German officers leading Irish troops. Index Cards. But they march well together. Typical of McGovern's young minions is Gene Pokorny, 26, a scholarly Nebraskan who, says Campaign Manager Gary Hart, has the mind of a revolutionist in the body of Henry Aldrich. Dispatched to Wisconsin a year ago on a salary of $200 a month, he tirelessly crisscrossed the state with clipboard and index cards in hand, organizing and opening 39 McGovern headquarters. When it was discovered that voting day fell during campus spring vacations, Pokorny ran forms in students newspapers which could be exchanged for absentee ballots. By election day an estimated 70% of the students cast their votes for McGovern and the number of workers had grown from 80 to 10,000. McGovern, say staffers, is no softie, despite his easygoing ways. He's a classic Clark Kent, says Aide Ted Van Dyk. All calmness on the outside -- serene -- but when crisis strikes, it's into the phone booth. He has other useful traits as well. Accused at a University of Wisconsin rally of being a warmonger for voting for passage of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, McGovern did not turn peevish as Muskie has done in the face of similar baiting. Instead, McGovern asked that those who believed the charge raise their hands; when less than six hands shot up, McGovern moved on to other matters. He has successfully overcome his image as a one-issue peace candidate by promoting his stands on income distribution, tax, reform and decreased defense spending. McGovern projects simplicity, honesty and candor. He remains confident despite the many Democratic leaders who still dismiss his candidacy. Meanwhile, stone by stone, George moves on. What Happened to Muskie? In just one month, Maine's Ed Muskie slipped from the position of the serene front runner to that of an embattled man on the verge of being knocked completely out of the race for his party's nomination for President. Before the plunge, much of the press (including TIME) and many politicians saw him as almost a certain first-ballot winner at the Democratic Convention in July. Now he could easily turn out to be what President Nixon derisively termed him after the 1970 Congressional elections: the George Romney of the Democratic Party. What went wrong? No single reason, or incident, can be cited to explain Muskie's decline. There was, in fact, a whole series of mistakes made by political pros, journalists, Muskie strategists and Muskie himself. In the first place, he probably should never have been rated so far ahead. That status was based largely on the fact that national surveys showed him to be the Democrat with the best chance to defeat Nixon -- but those polls do not translate into strength in state primaries. Yet that impression of Muskie's popularity had never really been tested in voting booths nationwide. Muskie had looked cool and impressive as Hubert Humphrey's running mate in 1968, and he exuded much more of a presidential aura than did his G.O.P. counterpart, Spiro Agnew. Yet few voters select a President primarily by looking at the vice presidential candidates, and Muskie's appeal was not really an issue in that election. Muskie was now recognized by most Democratic voters all right, but how did they really feel about him? No one could be sure. Euphoric. Nevertheless, Muskie and his advisers almost euphorically accepted the pleasant notion that he was far ahead of the field -- and they designed a campaign based on that assumption. He would speak cautiously, even vaguely, if need be, on most issues, so as not to antagonize any large blocs of voters. Ignoring his rivals for the nomination, he would campaign against the President. The essence of that campaign would be to portray Nixon as an excitable, expedient politician whose statements were rarely credible. By contrast, voters were urged to trust Muskie, the man of integrity. That strategy might have been sound if the premises had been right. Muskie at his best is far more inspiring than Nixon, who does have credibility problems and is unpredictable. Nixon had sounded shrill and unfair as he tried to link Democrats with crime, drugs and antiwar violence during the 1970 congressional campaigns, while Muskie on that election eve effectively deplored such tactics and appealed for a return to reason. Perhaps the voters did long for a calmer, loftier leader. To further the bandwagon psychology, the Muskie strategists won endorsements from big names in the party: California Senator John Tunney, Ohio Governor John Gilligan, Illinois Senator Adlai Stevenson III, Iowa Senator Harold Hughes, Pennsylvania Governor Milton Shapp. Each new name made the nomination seem that much more inevitable. This was organizing the party drive from the top down, rather than from the bottom up. Suddenly, the edifice began to crumble, and the entire strategy was shattered. Democratic voters showed that in primaries, at least, they were not all that concerned about finding a contrast with Nixon. They were not looking for a unifier and mollifier. They were in a balky, grumpy mood. They wanted specific answers to specific problems that plagued them. They were more interested in voting against the status quo, and men like George McGovern and George Wallace seemed to offer that chance to protest. Moreover Muskie hurt his own image as the judicious, controlled candidate by sobbing in the snows of New Hampshire, ironically at the very time that Nixon in Peking was acting as the healer of international passions. This outburst was partly the result of Muskie's emotional and physical fatigue. Trying to be all things to all people, and torn by his commitments to so many primary campaigns, he lost his sense of direction, creating doubts about his ability to stand up under pressure. Fed Up. Muskie's overconfident staff had also erred badly in ignoring grass-roots organizational work. In a primary, voters have to be coaxed to go to the polls and persuaded to select a particular name out of a crowded field. In New Hampshire, the Muskie camp had to send out-of-state organizers in at the last minute to get out a favorable vote. Muskie now concedes that entering the Florida primary was a mistake; once Wallace had entered, he should have known it was hopeless and avoided that first big blow to his front-running status. He relied heavily for support in Florida upon its Democratic state legislators -- but they were tied down by their duties in Tallahassee and were of little help. Muskie came out of his Florida defeat in a new fighting mood. He tackled specific issues, such as taxes and the economy, and began berating his competitors. Yet the turnabout gave Muskie the impression of a man lashing out in desperation, seeking a new image. Muskie's dilemma is painfully difficult. He has come across as a fuzzy Establishment kind of politician in a year when voters seem in revolt, and has been unable to put his brand on any issue that can attract that fed-up, turned-off voter. If he cannot beat such lesser-known Democrats, how can he be seen as the man to beat Nixon? He's got to find the ways to tap the anger and frustration that people have about big government and big business, says Senator Tunney, one of his now-disillusioned supporters. I know Muskie favors reform of institutions, but he hasn't been able to convey that. There is perhaps one consolation in all of the Muskie miscalculations so far. If the voters are as unpredictable as they early primaries indicate, similar troubles could lie ahead for the other candidates. Muskie may be no more finished now than he was a shoo-in in January.

An HSA combines the best features of all the various tax-advantaged retirement accounts available. If used correctly, money goes in tax-free, grows tax-free, and comes out tax-free.\n\nSound too good to be true? Read on to find out how it can be done and how you might qualify for one.\n\nWho is eligible for an HSA?\n\nIn order to qualify for an HSA, you must have a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). For 2017, your annual health insurance deductible must be at least $1,300 for single coverage (with an out-of-pocket maximum of $6,550) or $2,600 for family coverage (with an out-of-pocket maximum of $13,100).\n\nIn addition, you cannot be covered by another type of health insurance plan, be on Medicare, or be claimed as a dependent on someone's tax return.\n\nWhat is an HSA account?\n\nA health savings account is a triple-tax-advantaged account that allows individuals to save for current and future healthcare costs. You can open an HSA account through a bank, an insurance company, or another IRS-approved trustee.\n\nFor 2017, you can contribute $3,400 to an HSA if you have a high-deductible individual health insurance plan or $6,750 if you have a family plan. And individuals 55 or older can contribute an extra $1,000. Contributions are deductible from taxable income, the money grows tax-deferred, and the distributions are tax-free -- as long as they are used for qualified healthcare expenses. Individuals can also make a one-time transfer from an IRA to fund an HSA.\n\nAccording to the IRS, a high-deductible health insurance plan may cover some preventive care without a deductible. Otherwise, an individual can use the funds in an HSA to cover prescription drugs and other medical expenses. For a better understanding of what qualifies as a medical benefit, and for a list of examples of what is considered a qualified medical expense, see IRS Publication 502.\n\nFinally, if you withdraw funds from an HSA for non-medical expenses, you will owe income tax and pay a 20% penalty. But once you turn 65, an HSA mimics a traditional 401(k) or IRA: You can withdraw funds for any purpose, and you'll only owe income taxes.\n\nHow to use an HSA as part of your retirement strategy\n\nChoosing a health insurance plan for you and your family is a serious financial decision. Among other things, you must consider the health of you and your family, along with your available resources and ability to pay for medical care. If you're eligible for an HSA and can afford to pay for all or most of your increased out-of-pocket medical bills now, including meeting the higher deductible, then saving in an HSA for your retirement might make sense.\n\nAn HSA account is similar to other retirement accounts in that the account is portable and moves with you, the funds roll over from year to year, and you can invest the money in the account for the long term. Even if you use some of the funds during the year and are able to save only a portion of your yearly contribution, you can invest the balance, making this another opportunity to save for your retirement years.\n\nSponsored Content from The Motley Fool:\n\n• 5 Years From Now, You'll Probably Wish You Grabbed These Stocks\n\n• Kansas Man Turns $10,000 into $8 Million\n\n• Shark Tank Just Revealed a Trillion-Dollar Idea\n\nAccording to a recent study by Fidelity, a couple in retirement today may need $260,000 to cover healthcare costs -- that's in addition to other living expenses. As we plan for retirement, we must continually look for new vehicles to help us achieve our goals using the most effective and tax-efficient methods available to us. And saving in an HSA can be a smart option.

Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984 Walter Mondale throws down gauntlet in run against Reagan My fellow Democrats, my fellow Americans: I accept your nomination. Behind us now is the most wide open race in political history. It was noisy - but our voices were heard. It was long - but our stamina was tested. It was hot - but the heat was passion, and not anger. It was a roller coaster - but it made me a better candidate, and it will make me a stronger president of the United States. I do not envy the drowsy harmony of the Republican Party. They squelch debate; we welcome it. They deny differences; we bridge them. The are uniform; we are united. They are a portrait of privilege; we are a mirror of America. Just look at us at here tonight: Black and white, Asian and Hispanic, Native and immigrant, young and old, urban and rural, male and female - from yuppie to lunchpail, from sea to shining sea. We're all here tonight in this convention speaking for America. And when we in this hall speak for America, it is America speaking. When we speak of family, the voice is Mario Cuomo's. When we speak of change, the words are Gary Hart's. When we speak of hope, the fire is Jesse Jackson's. When we speak of caring, the spirit is Ted Kennedy's. When we speak of patriotism, the strength is John Glenn's. When we speak of the future, the message is Geraldine Ferraro. And now we leave San Francisco - together. Future of America And over the next hundred days, in every word we say, and every life we touch, we will be fighting for the future of America. Joan and I are parents of three wonderful children who will live much of their lives in the twenty-first century. This election is a referendum on their future - and on ours. So tonight I'd like to speak to the young people of America - and to their parents and to their grandparents. I'm Walter Mondale. You may have heard of me - but you may not really know me. I grew up in the farm towns of southern Minnesota. My dad was a preacher, and my mom was a music teacher. We never had a dime. But we were rich in the values that were important; and I've carried those values with me ever since. They taught me to work hard; to stand on my own; to play by the rules; to tell the truth; to obey the law; to care for others; to love our country; to cherish our faith. My story isn't unique. In the last few weeks, I've deepened my admiration for someone who shares those same values. Her immigrant father loved our country. Her widowed mother sacrificed for her family. And her own career is an American classic: Doing your work. Earning your way. Paying your dues. Rising on merit. My presidency will be about those values. My vice president will be Geraldine Ferraro. Tonight, we open a new door to the future. Mr. Reagan calls it tokenism. We call it America. Ever since I graduated from Elmore High, I've been a Democrat. I was attorney general of my state; then a U.S. senator. Then, an honest, caring man - Jimmy Carter - picked me as his running mate and in 1976 I was elected vice president. And in 1980, Ronald Reagan beat the pants off us. So tonight, I want to say something to those of you across our country who voted for Mr. Reagan - Republicans, Independents, and yes, some Democrats: I heard you. And our party heard you. After we lost we didn't tell the American people that they were wrong. Instead, we began asking you what our mistakes had been. And for four years, I listened to all of the people of our country. I traveled everywhere. It seemed like I had visited every acre of America. It wasn't easy. I remember late one night, as I headed from a speech in one city to a hotel a thousand miles away, someone said to me, Fritz, I saw you on TV. Are those bags under your eyes natural? And I said, No, I got them the old-fashioned way. I earned them. To the thousands of Americans who welcomed me into your homes and into your businesses, your churches and synagogues: I thank you. You confirmed my belief in our country's values. And you helped me learn and grow. New Realism So, tonight we come to you with a new realism: Ready for the future, and recapturing the best in our tradition. We know that America must have a strong defense, and a sober view of the Soviets. We know that government must be as well-managed as it is well-meaning. We know that a healthy, growing private economy is the key to the future. We know that Harry Truman spoke the truth when he said: A President . . . has to be able to say yes and no, but mostly no. Look at our platform. There are no defense cuts that weaken our security; no business taxes that weaken our economy; no laundry lists that raid our Treasury. We are wiser, stronger, and focused on the future. If Mr. Reagan wants to re-run the 1980 campaign: Fine. Let them fight over the past. We're fighting for the American future - and that's why we're going to win this campaign. One last word to those who voted for Mr. Reagan. I know what you were saying. But I also know what you were not saying. You did not vote for a $200 billion deficit. You did not vote for an arms race. You did not vote to turn the heavens into a battleground. You did not vote to savage Social Security and Medicare. You did not vote to destroy family farming. You did not vote to trash the civil rights laws. You did not vote to poison the environment. You did not vote to assault the poor, the sick, and the disabled. And you did not vote to pay fifty bucks for a fifty-cent light bulb. Four years ago, many of you voted for Mr. Reagan because he promised you'd be better off. And today, the rich are better off. But working Americans are worse off, and the middle class is standing on a trap door. Lincoln once said that ours is to be a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. What we have today is a government of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich. And we're going to make a change in November. Look at the record. Reagan Record First, there was Mr. Reagan's tax program. What happened was, he gave each of his rich friends enough tax relief to buy a Rolls Royce - and then he asked your family to pay for the hub caps. Then they looked the other way at the rip-offs, soaring utility bills, phone bills, medical bills. Then they crimped our future. They let us be routed in international competition, and now the help-wanted ads are full of listings for executives, and for dishwashers - but not much in between. Then they socked it to workers. They encouraged executives to vote themselves huge bonuses - while using King Kong tactics to make workers take Hong Kong wages. Mr. Reagan believes that the genius of America is in the boardrooms and exclusive country clubs. I believe that the greatness can be found in the men and women who built our nation; do its work; and defend our freedom. Truth About The Future If this administration has a plan for a better future, they're keeping it a secret. Here is the truth about the future: We are living on borrowed money and borrowed time. These deficits hike interest rates, clobber exports, stunt investment, kill jobs, undermine growth, cheat our kids, and shrink our future. Whoever is inaugurated in January, the American people will have to pay Mr. Reagan's bills. The budget will be squeezed. Taxes will go up. And anyone who says they won't is not telling the truth to the American people. I mean business. By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two-thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did. There's another difference. When he raises taxes, it won't be done fairly. He will sock it to average-income families again, and leave his rich friends alone. And I won't stand for it. And neither will you and neither will the American people. To the corporations and freeloaders who play the loopholes or pay no taxes, my message is: Your free ride is over. To the Congress, my message is: We must cut spending and pay as we go. If you don't hold the line, I will: That's what the veto is for. Now that's my plan to cut the deficit. Mr. Reagan is keeping his plan secret until after the election. That's not leadership; that's salesmanship. And I think the American people know the difference. I challenge tonight, I challenge Mr. Reagan to put his plan on the table next to mine - and then let's debate it on national television before the American people. Americans want the truth about the future - not after the election. When the American economy leads the world, the jobs are here, the prosperity is here for our children. But that's not what's happening today. This is the worst trade year in American history. Three million of our best jobs have gone overseas. Mr. Reagan has done nothing about it. They have no plan to get our competitive edge back. But we do. We will cut the deficits, reduce interest rates, make our exports affordable, and make America number one again in the world economy. We will launch a renaissance in education, in science, and learning. A mind is a terrible thing to waste. And this must be the best-educated, best-trained generation in American history. And I will lead our nation forward to the best system that this nation has ever seen. We must do it, we must do it. It is time for America to have a season of excellence. Parents must turn off that television; students must do their homework; teachers must teach; and America compete. We'll be number one if we follow those rules; let's get with it in America again. To big companies that send our jobs overseas, my message is: We need those jobs here at home. And our country won't help your business - unless your business helps our country. To countries that close their markets to us, my message is: We will not be pushed around any more. We will have a president who stands up for American workers and American businesses and American farmers in international trade. When I grew up, and people asked us to imagine the future we were full of dreams. But a few months ago, when I visited a grade school class in Texas and asked the children to imagine the future, they talked to me about nuclear war. As we've neared the election, this administration has begun to talk about a safer world. But there's a big difference: As president, I will work for peace from my first day in office - and not from my first day campaigning for re-election. As president, I will reassert American values. I'll press for human rights in Central America, and for the removal of all foreign forces from the region. And in my first hundred days, I will stop the illegal war in Nicaragua. We know the deep differences with the Soviets. And America condemns their repression of dissidents and Jews; their suppression of Solidarity; their invasion of Afghanistan; their meddling around the world. But the truth is that between us, we have the capacity to destroy the planet. Every president since the bomb went off understood that and talked with the Soviets and negotiated arms control. Why has this administration failed? Why haven't they tried? Why can't they understand the cry of Americans and human beings for sense and sanity in control of these God awful weapons? Why, why? Why can't we meet in summit conferences with the Soviet Union at least once a year? Why can't we reach agreements to save this earth? The truth is, we can. President Kennedy was right when he said: We must never negotiate out of fear. But we must never fear to negotiate. For the sake of civilization we must negotiate a mutual, verifiable nuclear freeze before those weapons destroy us all. A Second Mondale Term The second term of the Mondale-Ferraro Administration will begin in 1989. By the start of the next decade, I want to ask our children their dreams, and hear not one word about nuclear nightmares. By the start of the next decade, I want to walk into any classroom in America and hear some of the brightest students say, I want to be a teacher. By the start of the next decade, I want to walk into any public health clinic in America and hear the doctor say, We haven't seen a hungry child this year. By the start of the next decade, I want to walk into any store in America and pick up the best product, of the best quality, at the best price; and turn it over; and read, Made in the U.S.A. By the start of the next decade, I want to meet with the most successful business leaders anywhere in America, and see as many minorities and women in that room as I see here in this room tonight. By the start of the next decade, I want to point to the Supreme Court and say, Justice is in good hands. Before the start of the next decade, I want to go to my second Inaugural, and raise my right hand, and swear to preserve, protect, and defend a Constitution that includes the Equal Rights Amendment. My friends, America is a future each generation must enlarge; a door each generation must open; a promise each generation must keep. For the rest of my life, I want to talk to young people about their future. And whatever their race, whatever their religion, whatever their sex, I want to hear some of them say what I say - with joy and reverence - tonight: I want to be president of the United States. Thank you very much. (This is the Associated Press text of former Vice President Walter F. Mondale's July 19 speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination as delivered at the Democratic National Convention, in San Francisco.)
It's always a little surprising. In good times and bad, at least 75 million US households have ended up owing nothing in federal income taxes in recent years.\n\nThey're not dodging their tax obligations. It's just the way the US tax code works.\n\nThis year, an estimated 45% of tax filers — or just under 79 million households — are likely to have zero federal income tax liability, according to the Tax Policy Center.\n\nIf the new tax law hadn't gone into effect, the percent would have been closer to 43%. Put another way, the law added another 2.3 million households to the rolls of non-payers.\n\nBoth figures, however, come in below the 50% of non-payers recorded in 2009.\n\n[That] was the peak both because of the effects of the recession on employment and incomes, but also partly a result of temporary tax policies like the Making Work Pay tax credit that further reduced income tax liabilities, said Joe Rosenberg, senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center.\n\nLooking ahead, TPC estimates between 44% and 45% of households — or roughly 80 million — will pay no federal income tax for the next several years.\n\nGetting to zero on your 1040\n\nThe ranks of non-payers are dominated by low- and middle-income households for several reasons.\n\nThe tax code is progressive so those who make very little don't end up owing tax.\n\nRelated: We asked how Trump's tax cuts were affecting CNNMoney readers. Hundreds responded.\n\nOthers, meanwhile, don't make a lot and can eliminate their federal income taxes through the use of the (now nearly doubled) standard deduction and some key credits such as the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, which offset your tax bill dollar-for-dollar.\n\nAnd lower income retirees who live primarily off Social Security don't pay taxes on their benefits.\n\nBut there are non-payers in the upper-income ranks too. TPC estimates this year about 7% of filers with total incomes between $86,000 and $150,000, and about 1% of filers making more than that won't owe anything.\n\nThey may whittle their tax bill to zero by taking a lot in itemized deductions, even though those options are narrowed under the new law.\n\nVery high income non-payers may get lot of income from tax-exempt investments or carry a lot of losses from prior years if they're involved in a business or partnership. Such losses can offset your current taxes.\n\nThe payroll tax tab\n\nThe majority of tax filers who don't pay federal income tax still owe payroll taxes, however.\n\nFor instance, only about 12% of those in the lowest income group (making less than $25,000 all in) will end up owing income taxes this year, but 58% will owe payroll taxes, TPC estimates. The 42% in the group who don't end up owing payroll taxes typically don't earn a wage or are retired.\n\nRelated: Why the new tax law could make your state tax bill go up\n\nIndividuals with jobs will pay 6.2% of wage and salary income up to $128,700 into Social Security this year. And they will pay 1.45% of all their earned income for Medicare. Their employers will match those amounts, but economists say the employer payroll tax burden is ultimately borne by the worker, too, through lower wages.\n\nAll in, TPC estimates three-quarters of all filers will pay payroll taxes this year. And many who end up owing both income and payroll taxes will end up paying more in payroll taxes.
The new federal tax law created a lot of confusion over whether tax filers may still deduct the interest they pay on their home equity loans and home equity lines of credit.\n\nThe new law suspends the deduction for interest on home equity indebtedness for the next eight years.\n\nBut it turns out the suspension does not apply to all home equity loans (HELs) and lines of credit (HELOCs).\n\nIt just applies to those that are used to pay for non-home-related things, like paying off your credit card or buying a car.\n\nBut you can still deduct home equity loan interest that is used to pay for home improvements.\n\nUntil this year, you had been allowed to deduct the interest you paid on up to $100,000 in HELs and HELOCs, regardless of how you used the money.\n\nRelated: It's getting more expensive to buy a home\n\nTo clear up the confusion the IRS recently issued some clarifying guidance to let people know that in many cases you may continue to deduct the interest you pay when you borrow against your home equity.\n\nHere's the deal:\n\nDespite their names, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit are not considered home equity indebtedness under the law when they're used for acquiring, constructing or improving your primary residence and are secured by your home.\n\nIndeed, when the money is used to build or improve your home, the loans are considered acquisition debt like the mortgage you got to buy your house.\n\nAnd the new tax law still allows you to deduct the interest you pay on acquisition debt.\n\nRelated: Is your paycheck being taxed enough? Check the new IRS calculator\n\nBut it does limit that deduction going forward.\n\nFor loans taken out between now and December 31, 2025, after which the suspension ends, you may only deduct the interest you pay on up to $750,000 of acquisition debt. That limit applies to your mortgage and home equity loans or lines of credit combined.\n\nSo if you go out tomorrow and get a $750,000 mortgage then a few months later take out a $100,000 HEL to build an addition and replace your roof, you may only deduct the interest on your total debt up to $750,000.\n\nIf, however, you had taken out that same mortgage and HEL on or before December 15, 2017, the applicable limit for acquisition indebtedness is $1 million, so you could deduct all your interest.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez proposed taxing the wealthy as high as 70% to fund a climate change plan she's pushing called the Green New Deal.\n\nThere's an element where, yeah, people are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes, the freshman New York lawmaker said in an interview with Anderson Cooper that's slated to air Sunday on CBS' 60 Minutes.\n\nIn a clip of the interview that was released on Friday, Cooper asked Ocasio-Cortez about the specifics of the Green New Deal, a plan that calls for reducing carbon emissions to zero and moving the country off of fossil fuels in 10 years.\n\nOnce you get to the tippie-tops, on your $10 millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60% or 70%. That doesn't mean all $10 million dollars are taxed at an extremely high rate. But it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more, Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\nShe also acknowledged that her goal is ambitious.\n\nIt's going to require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible right now, she told Cooper. What is the problem with trying to push our technological capacities to the furthest extent possible?\n\nBut she added, I think that it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country, citing President Abraham Lincoln's issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation and President Franklin Roosevelt pushing for the passage of Social Security.\n\nAsked if she considers herself a radical, Ocasio-Cortez replied, Yeah, if that's what radical means, call me a radical.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, the youngest woman elected to Congress, was sworn into the US House on Thursday. A Democratic-Socialist, she has also pushed Medicare for all, tuition-free public college, canceling all student loan debt and housing as a federal right.
The start of a new year is a good time to update your budget -- or create one in the first place. But as you review your budget and, hopefully, adjust it for your raise, here are a few more changes you should really think about making.\n\n1. Carve out room for savings\n\nYour budget should include a line item for each spending category you encounter, from housing to cable to healthcare. But many people forget to incorporate one key line item: savings. If your budget doesn't have any wiggle room for savings, then it's time to reallocate your income so that savings come first. Ideally, you should aim to put away 10% or more of each paycheck, but if that's not feasible right now, then start slowly and work your way up.\n\nNo matter your age or income, you need an emergency fund with enough money to cover three to six months of living expenses. If you've yet to hit this target, any money you save should go directly toward an emergency account. Once you have enough short-term savings, shift your focus to long-term goals, like retirement or the house you're hoping to buy.\n\n2. Factor in one-time expenses\n\nMany of us have bills that creep up just once a year, like that annual heating maintenance fee or warehouse club renewal. If your budget doesn't already allow for these, look at your records from the past few years and identify the different one-off expenses you encountered. Then add those numbers up, divide the total by 12, and factor that amount into your budget each month.\n\nLet's say you spent $100 last year on a gutter cleaning in January, $400 in April on your annual lawn treatment, and another $100 in June to renew your warehouse club membership. In that case, you'll need to add a $50 line item each month to cover these sporadic expenses. If you pay your homeowners' or renters' insurance all at once, that's another cost to allocate over the course of 12 months.\n\n3. Eat out less often\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average American household spends $3,008 a year, or $250 a month, on restaurants and takeout. But because most food establishments charge a 300% markup on what they serve, spending that much each year means throwing away a good $2,000 all-in. If you were to cut that spending in half, you'd have an extra $1,000 a year to save, invest, or use to pay down debt.\n\n4. Unload your vehicle\n\nOwning your own vehicle can be a nice convenience, and in some places, it's truly a must. But if you live in or near a city with ample public transportation, you might consider getting rid of that automobile, relying more on buses, trains, or a bicycle, and pocketing the savings. AAA estimates that it costs $8,700 a year, or $725 a month, to own a vehicle. On the other hand, according to LendingTree, the most expensive public-transportation commute in the nation -- in our capital of Washington, D.C. -- costs $237 a month. Compared to $725, that's a $488 monthly savings.\n\nEven if you were to take an Uber back and forth to work every day in New York City, you'd spend just $705 a month on average, which might still be slightly cheaper than owning a vehicle. Plus, you wouldn't have to assume the risk of major breakdowns or worry about parking.\n\n5. Stop banking on that bonus or tax refund\n\nMaybe you've gotten a bonus or tax refund over the past few years -- perhaps even consistently. But if you're including that money in your budget, then you're making a big mistake. Bonuses in particular are by no means guaranteed, and if your company has a bad year or you don't meet certain goals, you might not see that extra income this time around.\n\nTax refunds can be tricky, too. First of all, in an ideal world, you shouldn't be getting a significant refund in the first place, because that's just loaning the government money for free. But even if you've snagged a sizable refund over the past few years, it can be tough to figure out where it came from unless you're really in tune with your finances. It could be, for example, that you were eligible for certain tax credits or deductions in the past that no longer apply. That's why banking on a bonus or tax refund can really hurt you. If you count on money that never comes your way, you'll risk overspending and taking on debt.\n\nSponsored Content from The Motley Fool:\n\n• 5 Years From Now, You'll Probably Wish You Grabbed These Stocks\n\n• Kansas Man Turns $10,000 into $8 Million\n\n• Shark Tank Just Revealed a Trillion-Dollar Idea\n\nThe more precise and strategic you are with your budget, the better your chances of saving money and staying on top of your finances.

The Amex Gold card is ideal for foodies who spend money both eating in and dining out, and it comes with up to $240 in credits each year.\n\nStory highlights Thanks to up to $240 in annual credits, the American Express® Gold Card can almost pay for itself Amex Membership Rewards points earned with the card are extremely valuable when redeemed for travel The card is ideal for people who spend lots of money at restaurants and U.S. supermarkets\n\n(CNN) —\n\nCNN Underscored reviews financial products such as credit cards and bank accounts based on their overall value. We may receive a commission through the LendingTree affiliate network if you apply and are approved for a card, but our reporting is always independent and objective.\n\nOur quick take: The American Express® Gold Card is a foodie's dream, allowing you to rack up plenty of Membership Rewards points with its bonus categories on dining worldwide and at US supermarkets. The popular limited-edition Rose Gold design is now back as a permanent option, and thanks to new credits that have been added for 2021, the card almost pays for itself every year.\n\nPros:\n\nWith up to $240 in included credits each year, card members can effectively get and keep the card for just $10 annually.\n\nEarn an industry-leading 4 points for every dollar you spend on dining worldwide.\n\nEarn 4 points per dollar at US supermarkets up to $25,000 per year (1 point per dollar thereafter).\n\nEarn 3 points per dollar on flights booked directly with airlines.\n\nCons:\n\nCredits require planning and strategy to maximize.\n\nOther cards may be better for everyday purchases.\n\n$250 annual fee.\n\nCurrent welcome bonus: Earn 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on eligible purchases within the first six months after opening the account.\n\nBest for: Points-minded travelers who spend significant money each month on dining, groceries and travel.\n\nDigging into the American Express Gold\n\nThe American Express Gold is a standout card, largely due to its clear efforts to be top-of-wallet in a few categories that are significant to many US households. Take a look at your budget — do you spend a fair amount of your cash on food right now? Chances are, the answer is yes.\n\nAmex designed the Gold Card to cater to those who spend nontrivial amounts at restaurants and on groceries, offering 4 points for every dollar you spend at eateries worldwide and at supermarkets in the United States. You'll also net 3 points per dollar on flights booked directly with airlines, which isn't too shabby.\n\nThe current 60,000-point welcome bonus — available after you spend $4,000 on purchases in your first six months of card membership — is the highest bonus offer we've ever seen available on this card. And those Membership Rewards points are worth at least $600 when you redeem them via Amex Travel for airfare, and potentially a lot more than that with Amex's transfer partners.\n\nAlso, in 2018, American Express introduced a limited-time Rose Gold design for the Amex Gold, which was so popular that it was brought back again for a short while in 2019. Now, the issuer has announced that Rose Gold will be a permanent option for new card members going forward. That means you can choose between either the original Gold or Rose Gold design when you're approved for the card.\n\nBut here's the best part: When you combine the bonus with up to $120 in annual dining credits on the card and up to $120 in Uber Cash each year, American Express is literally almost paying you to hold this card.\n\nClick here for the bonus offer on the American Express Gold card.\n\nAdvantages of the American Express Gold\n\nThe biggest long-term advantage of the American Express Gold is its superior earning rate at US supermarkets and restaurants worldwide. With no foreign transaction fees, this should be your go-to card for dining everywhere you go. In fact, those bonus categories are so strong that it may be worth holding this card even if you only ever use it for dining and groceries.\n\nGiven that this is very much a food lover's card, it comes as no surprise to see up to $120 in annual statement credits are available for select dining spots as well. You can earn up to $10 in statement credits each month (so, $120 annually) when you pay with the Gold Card at Grubhub, Seamless, The Cheesecake Factory, Ruth's Chris Steak House, Boxed and participating Shake Shack locations.\n\nPHOTO: Grubhub Get up to $10 in credits each month for purchases at Grubhub and other select dining establishments.\n\nBut that's only the half of it. The Amex Gold also now comes with both a complimentary Uber Eats Pass membership for up to 12 months when you enroll by December 31, 2021, and $10 in Uber Cash each month. Uber Cash can be used either for Uber rides, or on food delivery orders made with Uber Eats.\n\nAdd it all together, and you're getting up to $240 in credits every 12 months. Since the Amex Gold has an annual fee of $250, if you can use all the credits, you're effectively paying only $10 for the card each year.\n\nAnd then there are the points. How much potential value can you get with the Membership Rewards points you earn with the Amex Gold? While you can exchange points for cash in order to pay down the balance due on your statement, each point nets you just 0.6 cents when you redeem them that way.\n\nYou can also shop at Amazon with Amex points at a rate of 0.7 cents apiece, or redeem for an array of gift cards or for airfare at Amex Travel at around 1 cent per point. Plus, Amazon sometimes offers additional discounts on purchases when using Amex points to pay for even a part of your order.\n\nRelated: Get up to $50 off at Amazon with targeted American Express cards.\n\nBut while the above options are easy — and yes, it's important to have easy options — savvy travelers will want to utilize Amex's 21 transfer partners for remarkable redemptions. Amex has partnerships with myriad hotels and airlines, enabling Membership Rewards points to be used for travel that would be prohibitively expensive if paid for in cash.\n\nAmex also includes a baggage insurance plan on the Gold Card, covering eligible lost, damaged or stolen baggage when you purchase the entire fare for a plane, train, ship or bus ticket with the card. In addition, you'll get secondary car rental loss and damage insurance for most vehicle types and in most countries.\n\nAnd the Amex Gold also comes with trip delay insurance, meaning if your trip is delayed more than 12 hours due to a covered reason, you can get up to $300 in unexpected expenses reimbursed.\n\nRelated: Having a credit card with trip insurance could save you thousands on your next vacation.\n\nA couple of overlooked-but-useful perks: American Express cardholders are often eligible for early access to tickets through Ticketmaster. While obviously there aren't any concerts happening at the moment, when the pandemic ends, getting a head start on ticket sales might be the difference between an enviable seat and a chair in the nosebleeds.\n\nAlso, Amex Offers have been quite stout of late. This is a rotating selection of discounts, covering everything from clothing to tax preparation software to travel. Those who make a habit of watching new ones pop up can save hundreds per year on purchases they were planning to make anyway.\n\nGet almost as much in annual credits as you pay for the American Express Gold card.\n\nDisadvantages of the American Express Gold\n\nPHOTO: iStock The Amex Gold is a good choice for dining and at supermarkets, but not as an everyday card.\n\nThe American Express Gold is a specialized card. Beyond dining, supermarkets and airfare, you'll earn only 1 point for every dollar you spend on everything else. This means the card works best when paired with a card like our benchmark credit card, the Citi® Double Cash Card, for purchases that don't fall into the Gold Card's bonus categories.\n\nRelated: Read CNN Underscored's review of the Citi Double Cash Card.\n\nWhile the included credits are worth almost as much as the annual fee each year, they take a bit of strategy to use. The credits are capped at $10 per month, so you can't just use them in one fell swoop. Plus, the list of eligible restaurants is small. If you live in an urban area where Grubhub and Seamless are available, utilizing this credit becomes easier. But if you don't, maximizing the dining credit can be a challenge.\n\nAlso, while this won't impact many families, the 4x return at US supermarkets is capped at $25,000 per calendar year with the Gold Card. If you spend more than that on groceries in a year, you'll earn just 1 point per dollar after that.\n\nFinally, it's worth mentioning that Membership Rewards points take some studying and effort to really maximize. Managing transfer partners and dealing with dynamic award charts may feel like too much work for many, and you can't easily transfer Amex points to friends who may view this as a hobby. If you're looking for travel rewards that are easier to redeem, you'll likely want to pick a card like the Capital One® Venture® Rewards Credit Card or Chase Sapphire Preferred Card as an alternative.\n\nStacking up the American Express Gold against our benchmark\n\nCNN Underscored has chosen the Citi Double Cash card as our benchmark credit card. That doesn't mean it's the best credit card on the market — rather, it means we use it as a basic standard to compare other credit cards and see where they score better, and where they're worse.\n\nHere's how the Amex Gold scores against our benchmark. The features of each card in the below chart are colored in green, red or white. Green indicates a card feature that is better than our benchmark. Red indicates the feature is worse than our benchmark, and white indicates the feature is either equivalent or cannot be directly compared to our benchmark.\n\nKEY DETAILS Citi Double Cash Card American Express Gold Card Card type Mastercard American Express Sign-up bonus None 60,000 points after spending $4,000 in the first six months REWARDS Earning rate 2% on all purchases (1% when you buy, 1% when you pay it off) 4 points per dollar on dining worldwide, 4 points per dollar at U.S. supermarkets up to $25,000 per year (1x thereafter), 3 points per dollar on airfare booked directly, 1 point per dollar on all other purchases Redemption value 1 cent (cash back) Up to 1 cent per point when booking through American Express Travel, 2.0 cents per point for transfers* Ease of basic redemptions Easy Easy Advanced redemption options Can convert cash back to ThankYou points that transfer to 16 airline partners if you also have the Citi Premier℠ or Citi Prestige® Yes, transfer to 21 airline and hotel partners Quality of advanced redemptions Good Great FEES Annual fee $0 $250 Foreign transaction fee 3% 0% BENEFITS AND PROTECTIONS Travel perks None None Purchase protections None Purchase Protection, Return Protection, Extended Warranty Travel protections None Secondary Auto Coverage, Trip Delay Reimbursement, Lost Baggage Insurance Other perks None Up to $120 in annual dining credits and up to $120 in annual Uber Cash INTEREST RATES ON PURCHASES AND BALANCE TRANSFERS Introductory purchase interest rate None None Introductory purchase interest length N/A N/A Standard purchase interest rate 13.99%-23.99% variable None — Charge Card Introductory balance transfer rate 0% None Introductory balance transfer length 18 months N/A Introductory balance transfer fee 3% or $5, whichever is greater N/A * Based on point valuations calculated by frequent flyer website The Points Guy.\n\nWhen reviewing other credit cards, we use this format and these criteria to compare them with our benchmark.

This cash back credit card has a $95 annual fee and offers unlimited 4% cash back on dining and entertainment, 2% cash back at grocery stores and 1% cash back on all other purchases. If you prefer cash back over travel points or miles, the Savor card may be the way to go — particularly if you can't easily leverage the annual credits on the Amex Gold.\n\nHowever, while cash back is infinitely more flexible than travel rewards — you can spend cash anywhere — you also can't increase the value of cash back the way you potentially can with points or miles. Membership Rewards points can be used with Amex's transfer partners to score premium trips for much less than you'd normally pay in cash, effectively increasing the value of your points when you redeem them.\n\nAlso, although it may not be immediately apparent, folks who are fond of the bonus categories on the Amex Gold should also look at the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass® Card. With a $95 annual fee, this card earns 6 Hilton Honors points for every dollar you spend at US restaurants, US supermarkets and US gas stations.\n\nBut keep in mind that points aren't all created equal. According to the point valuations of frequent flyer website The Points Guy, American Express points are worth 2 cents apiece, while Hilton points are only worth 0.6 cents each. That makes 4 points on the Amex Gold worth 8 cents, while 6 Hilton points are worth just 3.6 cents.\n\nShould you get the American Express Gold?\n\nPHOTO: American Express Get the American Express Gold card with either the Gold or Rose Gold design.\n\nThe American Express Gold is a must-have for those who know they'll spend heavily at restaurants and US supermarkets, and who also have the patience to maximize their Membership Rewards points through Amex's transfer partners. While cards like the Capital One Savor have a lower annual fee and no hoops to jump through to redeem your cash back, the 60,000-point bonus on the Amex Gold and credits that can be worth almost as much as the annual fee make it the winner right now.\n\nSo if you're looking to redeem credit card rewards for exotic travel once the pandemic is over, and you spend a lot of your time eating in or dining out, the Amex Gold could be a great fit for you. And if you decide it's a card that should be in your wallet, make sure to grab it now and get it with the highest welcome bonus offer we've ever seen for it, and credits that make the card almost pay for itself.\n\nLearn more and apply for the American Express Gold Card.\n\nFind out which cards CNN Underscored chose as our best credit cards of 2021.\n\nGet all the latest personal finance deals, news and advice at CNN Underscored Money.
Angela Merkel will be German chancellor for a fourth term. But she won't have an easy ride.\n\nThe rise of the far-right, and other small parties, in Sunday's election has made it tough for Merkel to form a government that commands a majority in parliament.\n\nThe euro sagged against the dollar on Monday on the prospect of months of political wrangling before the future direction of Europe's biggest economy becomes clear.\n\nHere's what the vote could mean for Germany, Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nA new government by Christmas?\n\nWith Germany's second biggest party -- the Social Democrats -- heading for a spell in opposition, Merkel has only one real option: a three-way coalition between her conservative CDU-CSU bloc and two smaller parties -- the liberal FDP and the Greens.\n\nThe parties have never governed together at national level, but earlier this year struck a deal to run the German state of Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nCoalition talks will be difficult, they always are, said Holger Schmieding, economist at Berenberg Bank. But Merkel is good at bridging such differences.\n\nRegardless of those skills, it will take time. Serious talks on forming a new government are unlikely to start until the middle of October, once the result of elections in the German state of Lower Saxony are known.\n\nThat means it may be December, or even early January, before the new government takes office.\n\nRelated: German inequality may have fueled far-right surge\n\nIt could be good for the economy\n\nThe three-way coalition could give an extra boost to the German and European economies.\n\nMerkel's party and the FDP are likely to prioritize policies that favor business and trade, and all three have promised tax cuts. The Greens also want the government to spend more money supporting families.\n\nRelated: Germans are falling out of love with their carmakers\n\nThese policies would boost consumer spending, which could in turn lower Germany's trade surplus -- something that would please the country's European partners, as well as President Trump.\n\nStill, any shift in overall economic policy is likely to be small.\n\nThe big picture is that any fiscal boost will be modest, said Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at Capital Economics. None of the three parties plans to invest as much as the [Social Democrats] advocated and all of the major parties want to keep a balanced budget.\n\n...but possibly bad for the car industry\n\nThe Greens are likely to push hard for their environmental policies. That could spell problems for German car makers, already shaken by the Volkswagen (VLKAY) diesel scandal and claims that they were operating a cartel.\n\nMorgan Stanley economists said dealing with the fallout from these issues was likely to take center stage in German politics, given the importance of the automotive industry to the economy.\n\nOn the whole, the Greens pursue more ambitious goals and a more radical response to the diesel scandal, Elga Bartsch and Jan Kozak wrote in a research note.\n\nThe Greens want to ban the registration of cars with combustion engines from 2030 -- a decade earlier than Britain and France have proposed. Merkel has hinted she could support a ban but has given no indication of the timing.\n\nShares in Volkswagen and BMW (BMWYY) slipped on Monday, despite narrow gains on German stock markets.\n\nRelated: Infrastructure is Germany's weak link\n\nEuropean integration could slow\n\nThe new government might take a more cautious approach to further integration between Europe's economies.\n\nNew French President Emmanuel Macron wants to push through radical reforms of the European Union. He argues that closer cooperation between countries that share the euro currency -- such as the introduction of a common finance minister and budget -- would make Europe stronger and more stable.\n\nBefore Sunday's election, Merkel had appeared willing to work with Macron on finding a consensus for reform. Now that might be harder for her, given the liberal FDP are skeptical.\n\nA final compromise should still see European integration move forward in the coming years. That said, it is likely to be at a slower pace than currently envisaged by Merkel and [Emmanuel] Macron, said Ricardo Garcia, economist at UBS.
New Delhi (CNN) Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered a complete lockdown for India's 1.3 billion people on Tuesday, warning that many families will be destroyed forever if the country didn't get to grips with its coronavirus outbreak in the next three weeks.\n\nModi said the lockdown would start at midnight local time, would last for a minimum of 21 days, and would apply to all of India's 36 states and territories.\n\nYou have seen the worldwide situations arising from the coronavirus pandemic in the news. You have also seen how the most powerful nations have become helpless in the face of this pandemic, Modi said in a live televised address to the nation on Tuesday evening ahead of the deadline.\n\nIndia is the world's second most populous country and the fifth biggest economy, but so far, it has appeared to avoid the full hit of the pandemic. The country has confirmed 519 coronavirus cases , including 10 deaths and 39 patients who have been cured, according to the Ministry of Health.\n\nA number of Indian states have ordered lockdowns in the past few days, in an attempt to stop the virus from spreading. International borders have been shut to most travelers coming from the Europe.\n\nA protest against the country's Citizenship Amendment Act at Delhi's Shaheen Bagh was cleared by the police on Tuesday after the government prohibited all public gatherings in the city. Hundreds of women have been protesting at the site for months , expressing their solidarity with protesters who have been allegedly assaulted by police.\n\nModi said that the measures are necessary to protect the population, and referred to experience from other countries.\n\nWhat the experts are saying is that social distancing is the only option to combat coronavirus. That is to remain apart from each other and stay confined to within your homes. There is no other way to remain safe from coronavirus. If we have to stop the spread, we have to break the cycle of infection, he said.\n\nFrom 12 midnight today, the entire country will go under a complete lockdown to save India and for every Indian, there will be a total ban on venturing out of your homes. Therefore, I request you to remain wherever you are in this country, Modi added.\n\nOnly essential services will be operational. These include water, electricity, health services, fire services, groceries and municipal services.\n\nAll shops, commercial establishments, factories, workshops, offices, markets and places of worship will be closed and interstate buses and metros will be suspended. Construction activity will also be on a halt during this period.\n\nModi said if the outbreak was not dealt with properly it could set the country back decades.\n\nAccording to health experts, a minimum of 21 days is most crucial to break the cycle of infection. If we are not able to manage this pandemic in the next 21 days, the country and your family will be setback by 21 years. If we are not able to manage the next 21 days, then many families will be destroyed forever, Modi said.\n\nTo soften the economic blow from the shutdown, the Indian government announced a number of measures on Tuesday.\n\nDeadlines to file tax returns have been extended by three months, charges on minimum bank balances have been waived and no fees will be charged for using other banks' ATMs.\n\nThe threshold for invoking insolvency has been raised to $131,000 from $1,300, India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said at a news conference earlier on Tuesday.\n\nSeparately, India's Labor Ministry has advised all territories to to help construction workers who are out of work because of the outbreak. The vast majority of the country's construction workers are considered as informal labor and earn their livelihood through daily wages. Around 35 million construction workers across the country are registered with construction welfare boards.
Like most of us, you're probably still trying to figure out how the federal tax overhaul will change what you'll owe Uncle Sam.\n\nBut the new law could affect how much you'll pay in state taxes as well.\n\nOf the 41 states that impose an income tax, all but five (Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, New Jersey and Pennsylvania) directly tie parts of their tax code to elements in the federal code.\n\nThey may use as their starting point a filer's federal adjusted gross income or federal taxable income. And they may adopt some of the same exemptions and deductions used at the federal level.\n\nBottom line: The more a state conforms to features in the federal code, the more their residents could feel an impact at the state level.\n\nThat is, unless their state makes changes. Some have started to, but many more are currently debating what to do.\n\nMany states have preliminarily estimated that they'll end up getting more revenue if they do nothing, meaning your state tax bill could grow, even though your state government hasn't done anything to raise your taxes.\n\nRelated: New York OKs plan to skirt controversial provision of GOP tax law\n\nSo legislatures across the country are debating what to do with the extra cash. They have three choices: Use it to make investments or fill budget holes. Provide offsetting tax cuts to residents. Or some combination of the two.\n\nColorado, for instance, estimates that it will collect hundreds of millions of dollars more each year between 2018 and 2025.\n\nOne reason is that the elimination of the federal personal and dependent exemptions could increase a Colorado resident's state tax bill by $191 per family member on one's return, according to estimates from staff economists of Colorado's legislative council.\n\nWhile Colorado lawmakers have introduced some bills — including one to expand a child care expense tax credit — to offset the loss of the personal exemption, it's not clear where the state will end up.\n\nMaryland estimated it could get an additional $500 million by doing nothing. Its lawmakers have decided to keep $200 million to invest in education. But this week, they struck an agreement in principle to make $100 million worth of tax changes to offset some of the state tax increases residents might owe as result of the federal changes.\n\nIdaho lawmakers, meanwhile, passed a bill lowering income tax rates to the tune of $100 million to offset their estimated revenue increase.\n\nBut that won't protect everyone in Idaho from a higher state tax bill. While the legislation will lower taxes for a lot of people, it would raise taxes on many large families, Richard Auxier, a research associate at the Tax Policy Center, noted in TaxVox.\n\nThat's because Idaho residents have been able to claim the full federal personal exemption and standard deduction on their state returns. The new federal law nearly doubled the standard deduction — which may reduce a filer's state tax burden. But it's not enough to offset the loss of personal exemptions for low- and middle-income parents with several kids.\n\nLawmakers have recently crafted a partial fix to the problem by increasing the newly created state child tax credit.\n\nRelated: 2018 federal tax cuts by state\n\nMeanwhile, some other states are trying to make a few technical corrections to address potential tax increases, said John Hicks, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers.\n\nNebraska lawmakers, for instance, have advanced a bill to create a state personal exemption to offset the loss of the federal one.\n\nIf you do face a higher state tax bill because your lawmakers don't act, Hicks thinks it's unlikely that the increase would wipe out the tax cuts you might see on your federal tax return.\n\nIt will still be a net tax cut, Hicks said.\n\nUnless, of course, you're in the minority of filers in 2018 who are also facing a federal tax increase.

View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\nBecause any self-respecting institutionalist who has devoted his life to the defense of the Constitution and separation of powers should be able to recognize how dangerous and disingenuous lawyer Alan Dershowitz's argument is on behalf of President Trump.\n\nIf a president did something that he believes will help him get elected, in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment, Dershowitz said on Wednesday.\n\nWith this argument, Dershowitz completely conflates a president's self-interest with the national interest. If a president thinks 'I'm the greatest president there ever was. If I'm not elected the national interest will suffer greatly,' Dershowitz believes that cannot be impeachable.\n\nThis is not consistent with the vision of the founders. It guts the system of checks and balances and it defies common sense. But we might be waiting a while to hear the cries of outrage from small-government constitutional conservatives like Sens. Rand Paul and Mike Lee -- despite the fact that this is the most breathtaking argument for an imperial presidency that could possibly be imagined.\n\nJUST WATCHED Dana Bash shuts down GOP senator over Dershowitz's claim Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dana Bash shuts down GOP senator over Dershowitz's claim 03:49\n\nThat's because hyper-partisanship and polarization have lulled politicians into staying silent when it is politically convenient. As a reality check, just imagine how the Republicans would respond if a Democratic president's legal counsel advanced that argument. They would be outraged. And they'd be right.\n\nThere's been a full court press to roll back Dershowitz's comments. Don't buy it. It appears he said what he meant. Trump's legal team seems to recognize he went too far and could scare off swing votes. That's because the ideas he articulated are worth being alarmed about. If the Republican senators roll over for Dershowitz's argument, they won't get a do-over when similar circumstances emerge under a Democratic president. This will set a precedent for virtually unlimited executive power.\n\nUnder this logic, President Richard Nixon could have been justified for covering up Watergate because he sincerely felt that his re-election was in the national interest. If that seems like a stretch, former White House Counsel and star Watergate witness John Dean facetiously applied that logic to Nixon and wrote , All Nixon was doing was obstructing justice and abusing power because he thought he was the best person for the USA to be POTUS.... Seriously, that was his motive!\n\nEarlier in the week, Dershowitz also argued that abuse of power could not be considered an impeachable offense: It is inconceivable that the framers would have intended so politically loaded and promiscuously deployed a term as abuse of power to be weaponized as a tool of impeachment.\n\nActually, it is entirely conceivable that that was their clear intent. Because that's what Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist 65 : The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.\n\nSo don't be swayed by Dershowitz's Harvard law-professor credentials -- this isn't some novel reading of the Constitution. It is self-serving nonsense. And that's why every single one of the four legal experts who testified during the House impeachment hearing -- including Republicans' favorite Jonathan Turley -- say that impeachment does not require a crime\n\nThe real danger of the President's defense is clear when you consider the Office of Legal Counsel's opinion that a sitting president cannot be charged with a federal crime. This leaves impeachment as the only remedy to hold the President accountable for serious misconduct. The two-thirds threshold to convict and remove a president is already a high bar to meet -- even more so in an age of polarization. Dershowitz's argument would essentially take it off the table, and allow a president to do almost anything to ensure his re-election -- including asking a foreign power to intervene on his behalf.\n\nGeorge Washington would have thought that argument absurd. In his Farewell Address in 1796, he said: Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But that jealousy to be useful must be impartial.\n\nIt's worth remembering that George Washington was obsessed with the virtue of being of disinterested. It's not a word we use very often anymore, but it means not being driven by self-interest, because self-interest distorts judgment and can't be trusted.\n\nTrump's legal team is advancing exactly the opposite argument, to a sinister extent.\n\nDonald Trump raised eyebrows when he bragged during the 2016 campaign that his followers were so devoted that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing support. Nobody thought, then, that it would be the basis of a legal argument advanced by the President. But that's exactly the argument Trump's lawyer William Consovoy made in federal appeals court while trying to block the release of Trump's tax returns in October 2019. He argued that the President could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not be charged until he is out of office.\n\nThis absurd argument belongs in the legal hall of shame right alongside that of Nixon lawyer James St. Clair, who sounded a bit embarrassed when he told the US Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit:  The President wants me to argue that he is as powerful a monarch as Louis XIV, only four years at a time, and is not subject to the processes of any court in the land except the court of impeachment.\n\nSt. Clair's absurd defense at least made an exception for impeachment. Now Trump's legal team is taking it a step further -- by saying that he is effectively immune from a court of impeachment.\n\nThis is the King Trump defense. And it is an insult to our Constitution and separation of powers.\n\nAnyone who professes to care about the Constitution should recognize the danger of this argument. And if senators remain silent out of fealty or fear of a president from their party, they should not be allowed to forget it. History is watching and they will be establishing a new precedent that goes against their alleged principles.\n\nBut at this moment, it appears that even asking for additional information -- from credible conservatives like former National Security Adviser John Bolton -- is too much to ask. Here we have a direct witness who is willing to testify and who states in the unpublished manuscript of his forthcoming book that the President told him directly that he wanted to continue withholding congressionally appropriated military aid to Ukraine until they announced an investigation into his most formidable political rival.\n\nHearing from Bolton would force the Republican senators to confront uncomfortable facts. Instead, they seem eager to accept the word of a President who many acknowledge to be a liar and pretend that the highly relevant new information is not worth further investigation. Dershowitz's argument gives them a whisper of an argument to justify their complicity in a Trump coverup.\n\nThis is an insult to the trust put in them by the founding fathers. The Senate -- as articulated by Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 65 -- was expected to be a tribunal sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent...to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality in an impeachment trial.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.

Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Mitt Romney, who have hinted they could vote to hear from witnesses -- to uphold that standard. As of Thursday morning, Lamar said he was still undecided . Either way, his legacy will be written by the result of this vote.\n\nThe closing questions and debates in this impeachment trial represent much more than a partisan fight over power. They represent a fundamental challenge to the rule of law and the separation of powers. If hyper-partisan polarization is enough to make senators forget their oaths and even their own power as a co-equal branch of government, they will be setting a dangerous precedent that takes aim at the heart of our democracy at a time when autocracies are on the rise around the world.\n\nIn its place will be a President of low character who will be unleashed in pursuing his re-election by any means necessary.\n\nThis is happening right under the chief justice's nose -- and the question is whether he will let it happen without uttering a word of warning about the massively destabilizing impact it could have on the Constitution he has devoted his life to defending.
President Donald Trump said that members of his administration's coronavirus task force would be meeting with Congress to discuss a payroll tax cut relief and relief for hourly workers.\n\nWe are going to be asking tomorrow, we're seeing the Senate. We're going to be meeting with House Republicans, Mitch McConnell, everybody discussing a possible payroll tax cut or relief, substantial relief, Trump told reporters at a briefing Monday.\n\nWe're also going to be talking about hourly wage earners getting help so that they can be in a position where they're not going to ever miss a paycheck, he added.\n\nTrump added that he is working with leaders in the cruise ship and airline industry very strongly for potential relief from coronavirus-related losses.\n\nWe want people to travel to certain locations and not to other locations at this moment, he said. We're working with the industries.\n\nTrump also said the administration is in communication with the hotel industry, saying that some places actually will do very well, but others may not.

Now, investors will see if those gains can hold under Joe Biden, who will be sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Wednesday.\n\nA look back: Shares shot up after Trump's 2017 tax cuts supercharged corporate earnings, then plunged at record speed when Covid-19 began battering the United States. Since then, however, they've been rocketing higher, repeatedly reaching all-time highs. Deep political polarization and a worsening pandemic have not been enough to hold Wall Street back.\n\nDespite this sharp rally, stocks under President Donald Trump have not performed as well as they did during the first terms of Presidents Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, according to an analysis by my CNN Business colleagues Matt Egan, Annalyn Kurtz and Tal Yellin.\n\nAnd some of the recent increases can be attributed to Biden's win, which investors believe will generate substantial government spending to boost the economy. Stocks have gained about 13% since Election Day as of Tuesday — the best post-election market performance for a new president in modern history, according to CFRA Research.\n\nBiden has not put as much emphasis as Trump on stocks as a gauge of the country's strength or wellbeing.\n\nThe idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what's happening, Biden said of Trump in the final presidential debate in October. Where I come from in Scranton and Claymont, the people don't live off of the stock market. (Per the latest Gallup poll, 55% of Americans have some exposure to the stock market, many through retirement accounts.)\n\nEven so, Wall Street will be watching to see if market momentum can be maintained. Chatter has increased in recent weeks that corporate valuations, particularly in the tech sector, have jumped too high.\n\nMany investors worry that the equity market has rebounded too far and too fast and that there are signs of excess starting to emerge in parts of the financial system, Peter Oppenheimer, Goldman Sachs' chief global equity strategist, told clients this week. This is a reasonable concern given that the rebound in equities since the bear market trough in March of last year has been remarkable.\n\nOppenheimer said that while a correction — or a 10% decline in stocks from their recent peak — looks increasingly likely, the odds that stocks will enter a new bear market, dropping 20% from recent highs, in the next year appear fairly low.\n\nHe points to expectations of strong global economic growth in 2021 as the pandemic eases, as well as unprecedented policy support.\n\nOn that front, however, unknowns remain. While Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized that interest rates could remain at historic lows for the foreseeable future, the fate of Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package will rely on his ability to generate some Republican support. In a divided Washington, that will be no easy task.\n\nNetflix comes of age as it hits 200 million subscribers\n\nNetflix NFLX has come a long way since it launched in 1997 to send customers DVDs in the mail.\n\nThe latest: The streaming service told investors on Tuesday that it now has more than 200 million subscribers globally, after adding 8.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 — beating its own expectations.\n\nIt wasn't the only sign that Netflix has developed into a mature player in Hollywood and on Wall Street.\n\nThe company also said that it will no longer need to borrow money to finance day-to-day operations, and that it will explore returning cash to shareholders through stock buybacks.\n\nInvestor insight: Shares are up 13% in premarket trading, teeing them up to hit an all time high on Wednesday.\n\nCompetition in the streaming market remains fierce, of course. ViacomCBS' newly rebranded streaming service, Paramount+, will go live in early March, the company said Tuesday — joining an increasingly crowded field that also includes Disney+, Apple TV+, Amazon Prime Video, Comcast's Peacock, AT&T's HBO Max, and more.\n\nBut investors think Netflix appears to be in a good position to maintain its spot at the front of the pack. UBS, for example, upgraded the company's shares to a buy rating after it posted earnings, citing continued strong global subscriber growth even [against] rising competition [and] robust growth in the first half of 2020.\n\nRich Greenfield of LightShed Partners pointed out on Twitter that while investors previously seemed worried about how Netflix was going to finance its massive content production machine, the tone has shifted.\n\nThe question now, he says: What are you going to do with all the cash you will start generating in 2022 and beyond?\n\nJanet Yellen previews Biden's tough stance on China\n\nJanet Yellen, President-elect Joe Biden's nominee to lead the Treasury Department, has made clear the incoming administration will maintain a tough approach to dealing with China — setting the stage for prolonged tensions between the world's two biggest economies.\n\nTestifying before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday , Yellen promised to take on China's abusive, unfair and illegal practices.\n\nChina is undercutting American companies by dumping products, erecting trade barriers and giving away subsidies to corporations, she said.\n\nYellen added that while the Biden team would work with US allies, as opposed to acting unilaterally, she is prepared to use the full array of tools to address such concerns. Biden has said that he will not quickly eliminate Trump-era tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nThe stance was echoed by Antony Blinken, Biden's nominee to lead the State Department, in his comments Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nPresident Trump was right in taking a tougher approach to China, Blinken said. I disagree, very much, with the way that he went about it in a number of areas, but the basic principle was the right one.\n\nWhat it means: The battle between the United States and China on trade and technology has been a key source of uncertainty for investors over the past four years. Under Biden, that's not going away.\n\nUp next\n\nJoe Biden will be sworn in as the next president of the United States at 12 p.m. ET.\n\nMorgan Stanley MS Procter & Gamble PG UnitedHealth UNH Alcoa AA United Airlines UAL Also today: BNY Mellon,andreport earnings before US markets open.andfollow after the close.\n\nComing tomorrow: Economists expect another 910,000 first-time claims for unemployment benefits, a sign of US labor market weakness.

Bush, implicitly Appeals court Judge Jay Bybee, an appointee of President George W.
