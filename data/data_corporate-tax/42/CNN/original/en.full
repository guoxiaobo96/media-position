{"original": "Missouri is the site of one of the nation's most competitive Senate races. Sen. Claire McCaskill, who represents that state, which voted for Trump by almost 19 points, is one of the most vulnerable Democrats up in 2018. She faces Republican state Attorney General Josh Hawley in a race that both sides are focusing on for control of the upper chamber. Democrats have attacked Hawley's record as attorney general and focused on health care, while Republicans have criticized McCaskill for voting against the Republican tax bill and using a private plane to get around the state. McCaskill won re-election in 2012, when Obama lost Missouri by 10 points, but the state has moved to the right since then. Whatever the outcome, this could be one of the closest races in the country, and it could keep results-watchers up late, as heavily Democratic St. Louis County traditionally is late to announce its results."}

{"original": "Huddled for a lengthy meeting with his legal advisers, Trump was warned the pardons he once hoped to bestow upon his family and even himself would place him in a legally perilous position, convey the appearance of guilt and potentially make him more vulnerable to reprisals."}
{"original": "So, too, was Trump warned that pardons for Republican lawmakers who had sought them for their role in the Capitol insurrection would anger the very Senate Republicans who will determine his fate in an upcoming impeachment trial"}
{"original": "White House counsel Pat Cipollone and another attorney who represented Trump in his first impeachment trial, Eric Herschmann, offered the grave warnings as Trump, his daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner listened. Other lawyers joined by telephone. They all told Trump he should not pardon himself, his family or any GOP lawmakers in a prospective manner unless he was prepared to list specific crimes."}
{"original": "Cipollone and former Attorney General William Barr both warned Trump earlier this month they did not believe he should pardon himself, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN last week. Barr conveyed this position to Trump before resigning last month, sources say."}
{"original": "Trump continued to bring the matter up in the ensuing days, even after officials believed the issue was resolved. But the sobering meeting on Saturday evening at the White House seemed to put the idea to rest."}
{"original": "While Trump often discards advice he doesn't agree with -- particularly coming from Cipollone, with whom he has a fractured relationship -- the message Saturday resonated. The conversation spooked Trump in a way few others have, a person familiar with his reaction told CNN."}
{"original": "Now, Trump will leave office muted and disheartened at being unable to wield the power he has cherished most while president. Boxed in by his own actions that helped spark the riots at the Capitol, Trump finds himself constrained in a way he mostly avoided for his entire tenure."}
{"original": "His final batch of pardons, due later Tuesday, is expected to contain few of the controversial or outlandish criminals that have characterized his earlier use of his clemency powers."}
{"original": "Trump could still change his mind, and retains his sweeping clemency powers until noon on Wednesday. The President continues to bring up pardons that aides once thought were off the table, including for former strategist Steve Bannon, leading to general uncertainty about whether Trump will continue adhering to his lawyers' advice."}
{"original": "There is a frantic scramble happening behind the scenes on whether to grant Bannon a pardon. One concern is Bannon's possible connection to the January 6 riot of Trump supporters at the US Capitol, according to a source familiar with the discussions."}
{"original": "Trump has continued to go back and forth on Bannon's pardon into Tuesday night, sources told CNN."}
{"original": "Earlier Tuesday, White House officials and others familiar with the matter describe a muted President, concerned about his pending impeachment trial and swirling legal problems, who was talked out of his long-discussed notions following the Capitol insurrection."}
{"original": "Several Republican lawmakers who are alleged to have been involved in the rally that preceded the deadly riot on the US Capitol have sought clemency from Trump before he leaves office, but after meeting with his legal advisers for several hours on Saturday, the President decided he would not grant them, according to two people familiar with his plans."}
{"original": "The fear of legal exposure is not limited to Republicans who promoted or spoke at the rally, including Reps. Andy Biggs, Mo Brooks and Paul Gosar. Those who participated, organized and fundraised for it are also concerned, sources told CNN, including his eldest son Donald Trump Jr. and his girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle, who both spoke at the rally."}
{"original": "Top figures associated with the groups that helped organize it -- including Women for America First and Turning Point Action, the political action committee arm of Turning Point USA -- have also voiced private concern about legal repercussions, a person familiar tells CNN."}
{"original": "Several of Trump's closest advisers have also urged him not to grant clemency to anyone who breached the US Capitol, despite Trump's initial stance that those involved had done nothing wrong."}
{"original": "As CNN has previously reported , one of the top organizers of the movement that aimed to overturn the election results claimed he worked closely with Republican congressmen. Ali Alexander, a leader of the Stop the Steal group, said in several livestream videos he planned the rally with Gosar of Arizona, Brooks of Alabama and Biggs of Arizona."}
{"original": "The idea of pardoning himself has captivated Trump nearly the entire span of his presidency. He viewed the prospect as a unilateral magic wand he believed could ease his legal troubles, if not make them disappear entirely."}
{"original": "Almost as alluring: preemptive clemency for members of his family, who Trump has long bemoaned were being unfairly targeted by his enemies. Rendering them immune from retribution seemed like a raised middle finger to his detractors."}
{"original": "The legal standing of either move was questionable, and Cipollone had been direct and strong that a self-pardon was unlikely to hold up in court, a person familiar with the matter said. Internally, one of Cipollone's legacy items is believed to be whether he dissuades Trump from pardoning himself."}
{"original": "Others appealed to Trump by warning he should be more concerned about the effect it would have his legacy, not the legal standing of the pardons."}
{"original": "The decision to not pardon any Republican lawmakers or his family members was a last minute one. After initially defending the idea that he may pardon himself or his family members out of concern they would be targeted once he's out of office, Trump decided Saturday night that he would not pardon anyone in his family or himself."}
{"original": "Trump agreed with the attorneys and other advisers that doing so would increase the appearance of guilt and could make them more vulnerable, but was disappointed at the outcome, according to people familiar with the matter."}
{"original": "Trump, according to people he'd spoken to, appeared more taken with the message of unchecked power it might send to his naysayers than actual protection from liability. His pardon power was among his favorite perks of the job."}
{"original": "Trump will depart office facing significant legal questions that only escalated during his final days in office. His phone call to Georgia's secretary of state urging him to find votes and his speech encouraging his crowd to show strength in their march to the Capitol have both put him under a legal microscope."}
{"original": "The new possible criminal exposure comes on top of ongoing New York state investigations into the President's finances and multiple defamation lawsuits related to Trump denying sexual assault accusations by women. The Manhattan district attorney's office has a broad criminal investigation looking into allegations of insurance fraud and tax fraud. The New York attorney general has a civil investigation into whether the Trump Organization improperly inflated the value of its assets."}
{"original": "The sizable legal store the President now enters provided the looming backdrop to his ongoing discussion of pardons, which began in earnest last year."}
{"original": "Over the past weeks, Trump has discussed pardons incessantly with associates, often asking if people who had not been accused of any crime wanted one before he left office. The discussions unnerved some aides, who did not believe they were in line for prosecution."}
{"original": "Even as recently as Monday, with hours remaining in his presidency, Trump appeared fixated on pardons."}
{"original": "While he was considering preemptive pardons for his children and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, a source close to the process said those are no longer expected. Bannon, who has been indicted on fraud charges, is also not expected to receive a pardon on Tuesday, the source said."}
{"original": "Trump is also not expected to pardon Edward Snowden or Julian Assange, whose roles in revealing US secrets infuriated official Washington."}
{"original": "While he had once entertained the idea, Trump decided against it because he did not want to anger Senate Republicans who will soon determine whether he's convicted during his Senate trial. Multiple GOP lawmakers had sent messages through aides that they felt strongly about not granting clemency to Assange or Snowden."}
{"original": "As he departs office, Trump has expressed real concern that Republicans could turn on him. A conviction in the Senate impeachment trial would limit his future political activities and strip him of some of the government perks of being an ex-president."}
{"original": "Trump is less worried about being barred from running from office again, and more concerned with the optics of being convicted by the Senate, people familiar with the matter said."}

{"original": "It's a lesson Donald Trump learned all too well."}
{"original": "Throughout his life, the President has seemingly operated with that conviction -- that the world is a jungle, where you kill or be killed. The strong -- the winners -- get what they want, however they need to take it. Only the weak -- the losers -- play by the rules."}
{"original": "In Trump's world, there seems to be little wrong with lying to get the advantage. In fact, it's almost wrong not to, because if you don't screw the other guys, they sure as hell are going to screw you."}
{"original": "And that's the philosophy he's brought to the presidency, flagrantly defying rules and norms and undermining institutions that are the bulwark of a functioning democracy."}
{"original": "From the moment he descended the Trump Tower escalator in June 2015 and entered national politics with a barrage of incendiary, racist tripe , Trump has routinely and scurrilously lied and sold his self-serving version of events and conspiracy theories. He has willfully and cynically divided and inflamed the country he was elected to lead to suit his own ends."}
{"original": "Trump -- whose rise to power was built on an inflated, reality-show depiction of himself as a business titan -- has made a practice of exaggerating his own feats. The biggest! The best! No one's ever seen anything like this before!, he promised us."}
{"original": "Well, this time, Trump's finally right."}
{"original": "No president, in the long history of our republic, has ever been impeached twice. It is a record for ignominy that we can only hope will never be eclipsed, and the emblem of this most corrupt, chaotic and destructive of presidencies."}

{"original": "But however and whenever the US Senate acts on Trump's historic second impeachment, this much we know: He will leave office within a week, not as an honored former president but as the disgraced and selfish provocateur of a seditious uprising. The violent insurrection against the US Capitol and our democracy will be his epitaph."}
{"original": "The threat of legal action and disbarment from public office in the future still looms. But the President already has suffered the most painful penalty of all: Fred Trump's boy will go home a loser."}
{"original": "Trump has used past addresses to highlight his administration's victories, target his political enemies and push forward on efforts to fulfill his vision for the country."}

{"original": "I don't see the President making a big statement one way or another that would indicate anything different than what he's been saying for many months, one Republican close to Trump said."}
{"original": "A senior administration official laying out plans for the speech wouldn't divulge whether the President would bring up impeachment during his remarks, but they did say the speech isn't being written in a vacuum and it wouldn't be out of the ordinary for the speech to evolve before it's delivered."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, a handful of Republican senators said they hope Trump steers clear of impeachment talk during his address to the bipartisan audience."}
{"original": "Staunch ally Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said it would be smart to focus on other issues, encouraged Trump to be positive and posited that most people are ready to move on from impeachment."}
{"original": "I hope he is, too, because I am, said Graham."}
{"original": "The overall theme of Trump's speech will be the Great American Comeback, the senior administration official said. The President is expected to focus on what he sees as victories for his administration through the lens of election issues, such as the economy, health care and national security."}
{"original": "The official said Trump is expected to focus on five areas: blue-collar workers, promoting and supporting families, lowering health care costs, immigration and protecting American families."}
{"original": "The President is also expected to draw contrast between his beliefs and the proposed policies of Democrats."}
{"original": "Specifically, the official said Trump is expected to contrast his health care policies with those on the socialist left, presenting a sharp difference with policies such as Medicare for All, which has been touted by some Democratic presidential candidates."}
{"original": "Trump's speech is, of course, expected to be delivered in the presence of several members of Congress who are often at odds with the administration's policies. However, this year's speech will be a markedly more contentious year between the President and Democrats."}
{"original": "It will likely mark the first time Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have been in the same room in months. Their relationship became more tense after Pelosi began the impeachment proceedings, and, according to a Pelosi spokesman, the two have not spoken since the October 16 meeting in which Trump insulted Pelosi, including calling her a third-grade politician, before she and other top Democrats walked out and later accused the President of having a meltdown."}
{"original": "It will also likely mark the first time Trump will be in the same room as some of his Democratic opponents running for president. He's used recent interviews and speeches to unleash a litany of insults and attacks on his potential opponents, but the official previewing Trump's address wouldn't say whether he would do the same while speaking in the Senate chamber."}
{"original": "I won't preview if he's going to call anybody out but I think the President would be entirely comfortable with that, the official said."}
{"original": "Coverage of the Democrats' Iowa caucuses dominated televisions Tuesday morning, potentially increasing the odds that Trump will use his high-profile speech to swipe at potential rivals."}
{"original": "The President has used past State of the Union addresses to push new policy proposals, such as tax cuts, an infrastructure plan and health care revisions. Some of these proposals have been successful, while others have not."}
{"original": "During the 2019 State of the Union, Trump called for the great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure. But he held off on moving ahead, saying he would move on it only after the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement was passed by Congress. He signed the pact into law last week."}
{"original": "In 2018, Trump touted the success of his new tax cuts, calling them the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history and claiming they would be a boon to the economy. However, a combination of the reduced revenues due to the tax cuts and record-setting defense spending helped balloon the federal budget deficit to $1 trillion last year. More recently, the President has said he is considering cuts to entitlement programs as a means of debt reduction."}
{"original": "The global economy is still on an upswing, but the good times may not last beyond the next year or two."}
{"original": "The International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday it expects global growth will inch up from 3.8% in 2017 -- its fastest pace in six years -- to 3.9% in 2018 and 2019. That's in line with its most recent estimate in January."}

{"original": "(CNN) The twin US Senate runoffs in Georgia mean everything in American government for the next two years."}
{"original": "But it's not clear how quickly we'll know the results. CNN took until November 13 to project Biden's victory in Georgia's presidential contest , 10 days after Election Day."}
{"original": "There's plenty of reason to expect a repeat. Early voting, the counting of which helped drag out the presidential results, is nearly keeping track in these special runoffs. In Fulton County, the state's most populous, the elections administrator said Monday that the early vote totals were larger for January than for November."}
{"original": "Republicans in the state have expressed concern that there may be a Democratic edge in the early vote totals. Which means that Republicans may need a strong showing on Election Day again."}
{"original": "That's where President Donald Trump's feud with Republican state officials over his own loss in the state could mean the difference in the GOP having a majority going forward."}
{"original": "CNN's Ethan Cohen and Caroline Tounget looked at where the lead changed as the presidential votes in the state were counted during those 10 days:"}
{"original": "At 7:16 p.m. on Election Night, when the first significant votes were reported, Biden jumped out to an early lead with almost 62% of the vote. Only 2% of the estimated vote had been reported."}
{"original": "The lead bounced back and forth for the next hour, but Trump pulled ahead at 8:07 p.m., with 10% reporting."}
{"original": "Early Wednesday morning Biden began to gain on Trump and finally overtook him at 4:48am on Friday, November 6, according to the vote count."}
{"original": "Biden ultimately won by a little less than 12,000 votes."}
{"original": "Actually, it was 11,779. Trump's got that number burned on his brain since he specifically asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in their phone call this past weekend to find one more -- 11,780 votes -- just enough to win him the election."}
{"original": "While legal experts and constitutionalists are wondering if there's criminal liability for Trump's pressure on state officials to change results , the other end result of his war with Georgia officials from his party could be depressed turnout when the GOP needs it most."}
{"original": "Gabriel Sterling, the administrator of Georgia's election systems , said at a news conference Monday that the best thing for people frustrated by the presidential results would be to vote Tuesday."}
{"original": "If you're a Georgia voter, if you want your values reflected by your elected officials, I strongly beg and encourage you: Go vote tomorrow. Do not let anybody discourage you.

{"original": "A sweep by Democrats would open the door to more powerful fiscal stimulus that the shaky economy may very well need. But it would also raise the risk of corporate tax hikes that investors despise."}
{"original": "Biden's ability to govern. His ability to get the people he wants in his Cabinet and in other key roles is entirely up to the Senate. One reason we don't yet know his pick to be attorney general has got to be that Biden doesn't know if it's a Republican or Democratic majority who will be voting to confirm."}
{"original": "Congressional oversight and Biden. A Democratic majority will mean much less combative oversight, at least to start the Biden administration. It would also make Republican efforts to attack him over his son's previous business dealings -- Trump's top offensive in 2020 -- more difficult."}
{"original": "Since it became clear that Trump lost the election, he has been actively and openly trying to get state officials to ignore election results, a plan that was almost too brazen and anti-democratic to be believed."}
{"original": "What's worse than openly trying to get around election results is quietly asking state officials to change them and find new votes two months after the election you lost. What Trump does behind closed doors, it turns out, is worse than what he does in the open."}

If you think Trump is quietly working behind the scenes on Covid, which is If you think Trump is quietly working behind the scenes on Covid, which is killing an American every 33 seconds , the transcript of this call should put you straight."}
{"original": "He has no interest in hearing anybody else talk. Despite the best efforts of Raffensperger, who was respectful of Trump but firm in dismissing his theories, the President dominated the conversation, and all but threatened Raffensperger and his deputy."}
{"original": "He learned nothing from impeachment. For those senators who defended Trump and said he'd learned his lesson and would no longer use his office to pressure people for political favors, this must be a bitter pill. That a year after he was fighting impeachment, Trump would pressure a state official for votes is proof the tiger does not shed its stripes."}
{"original": "Imagine all the calls we'll never hear about and the pressure put on less scrupulous officials than those in Georgia."}
{"original": "Aside from fearing what Trump is capable of, this is also a moment to marvel at the strength of the US system, which so far has withstood all of his anti-democratic efforts. What's not clear is if any law enforcement agency -- the FBI or t he Fulton County DA , will make a criminal case out of this. Note: Prosecutions of former presidents are possible but have not occurred in modern times. It would be divisive and time-consuming."}
{"original": "Trump's first punishment will come January 20, when he has to move out of the White House."}
{"original": "Like most successful candidates, President Donald Trump's rhetoric from the campaign trail now runs up awkwardly against the often dense and arcane language that fills more formal executive actions and memos."}
{"original": "The impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful, beautiful southern border wall he pledged to build on the Mexican border has been reduced, on White House stationery, to a physical wall on the southern border. Trump has kicked off his administration with a slew of aggressive actions, but it might be hard to tell from the reading."}
{"original": "Here are a few examples of campaign technicolor translated into the black and white of legalistic, government documentation:"}
{"original": "1. In February 2016, Trump made this promise to a voter in New Hampshire."}
{"original": "Obamacare is a disaster and we're going to repeal it and we're going to replace it with something great."}
{"original": "As the administration and congressional Republicans now grapple with doing just that, Trump on his first day in office issued an executive order directing federal agencies to back off enforcing the law's mandate. Here's what it said:"}
{"original": "Sec. 2. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) and the heads of all other executive departments and agencies (agencies) with authorities and responsibilities under the Act shall exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications."}
{"original": "2. The construction of a wall – not a fence – on the US-Mexico border was a cornerstone of the Trump presidential bid. Appealing to voters, he led chants of build the wall and described the coming barrier like this during first rally:"}
{"original": "I will build a great wall – and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me – and I'll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words."}
{"original": "In the executive order Trump signed on Wednesday, he delivered the following, rather soberer instructions to the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security:"}
{"original": "(a) In accordance with existing law, including the Secure Fence Act and IIRIRA, take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border;"}
{"original": "(b) Identify and, to the extent permitted by law, allocate all sources of Federal funds for the planning, designing, and constructing of a physical wall along the southern border;"}
{"original": "(c) Project and develop long-term funding requirements for the wall, including preparing Congressional budget requests for the current and upcoming fiscal years; and"}
{"original": "(d) Produce a comprehensive study of the security of the southern border, to be completed within 180 days of this order, that shall include the current state of southern border security, all geophysical and topographical aspects of the southern border, the availability of Federal and State resources necessary to achieve complete operational control of the southern border, and a strategy to obtain and maintain complete operational control of the southern border."}
{"original": "3. Trump has also issued an executive order aimed at sanctuary cities. Back in September 2015, he told a rally in Dallas: We have to end this sanctuary cities crap. Later in the campaign, he made this declaration:"}
{"original": "Block funding for sanctuary cities. We block the funding. No more funds. We will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities."}
{"original": "And this is what it looked like on paper this week:"}
{"original": "Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to:"}
{"original": "(a) Ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States, including the INA, against all removable aliens, consistent with Article II, Section 3 of the United States Constitution and section 3331 of title 5, United States Code;"}
{"original": "(b) Make use of all available systems and resources to ensure the efficient and faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States;"}
{"original": "(c) Ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law;"}
{"original": "(d) Ensure that aliens ordered removed from the United States are promptly removed; and"}
{"original": "(e) Support victims, and the families of victims, of crimes committed by removable aliens."}
{"original": "Here's how his opposition to the deal sounded on the stump, at a rally in St. Clairsville, Ohio, in June 2016:"}
{"original": "The Trans-Pacific Partnership is another disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country – just a continuing rape of our country."}
{"original": "And this is what the formal departure looked like in a presidential memorandum from January 23. This, after a preamble on the importance of trade and American jobs:"}
{"original": "Based on these principles, and by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct you to withdraw the United States as a signatory to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), to permanently withdraw the United States from TPP negotiations, and to begin pursuing, wherever possible, bilateral trade negotiations to promote American industry, protect American workers, and raise American wages."}
{"original": "5. The Keystone XL pipeline, which would deliver more than 800,000 barrels of petroleum daily from the Canadian oil sands to refineries on the US Gulf Coast, was blocked by the Obama administration in 2015. Trump did not agree with that decision and made it a bone of contention during the campaign. Here's what he said last January in Iowa:"}
{"original": "When they do the Keystone Pipeline – I want it approved, I want all those jobs – I like a lot of oil flow, because right now we're low."}
{"original": "And here's what the announcement that Trump would re-open the process looked like in a presidential memo issued this week:"}
{"original": "Joe Lockhart is a CNN political analyst. He was the White House press secretary from 1998 to 2000 in President Bill Clinton's administration. He cohosts the podcast Words Matter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN."}
{"original": "(CNN) Tens of millions of Americans were glued to their televisions, laptops and mobile devices Wednesday as an act of domestic terrorism played out live for the whole world to watch. Fear, anger and disgust were the reactions I heard most from friends, family and on social media platforms."}
{"original": "While the anger has not dissipated, another emotion seems to be rising to the surface: helplessness. Many Americans are skeptical of the ability of politicians in Washington, particularly the Republicans, to hold all of the terrorists and their supporters accountable."}
{"original": "That helplessness is not without foundation. Time and time again for the last four years the American public has watched President Donald Trump avoid accountability for his outrageous and immoral behavior. Republicans have consistently enabled him, and our judicial system, with the exception of the election issues, has not been able to thwart his constant judicial stalling and obstruction. Color the American public skeptical that this time our institutions will deliver."}
{"original": "There are two potential paths for the politicians in Washington to punish the President: Invoking the 25th Amendment at the direction of the vice president and the cabinet, or impeaching Trump for a second time and holding a trial in the Senate."}
{"original": "The first of these seems unlikely to happen. It might require a broader deal -- if he were willing, Vice President Mike Pence could convince both Trump and the cabinet to remove the President in return for a full pardon from President Pence. It would be a risky move for Pence's future given the negative reception former President Gerald Ford received for pardoning Richard Nixon. And that kind of deal depends on Trump's emotional state and whether or not he believes he can pardon himself."}
{"original": "The House is likely to move on impeachment this week. The timing of sending the articles over to the Senate is where this gets interesting. The House can pass articles of impeachment quickly, but it is unlikely the Senate could pull off a trial before the President's term ended. Some Democrats worry that trying him in the new Senate, which they are allowed to do, would take focus away from a new President Biden's agenda. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi can hold onto the articles of impeachment for as long as she wants. One scenario would be to hold them until after the first hundred days of the Biden Administration so as to not interfere with Covid-19 and vaccine efforts, cabinet confirmations and economic recovery initiatives."}
{"original": "The bottom line is, while there are multiple options, it is still possible the President can run out the clock and once again avoid any legal responsibility for his actions. That's where the helplessness comes from for the majority of Americans. We've seen this movie before, and we don't like how it ends."}
{"original": "The good news for all Americans is that they are not completely helpless in punishing Trump for taking the country to the brink of authoritarianism. We all have power to deny him the vast privileges and riches that come with the distinction of being the former president of the United States."}
{"original": "How do we do that? Here's a few ideas to make sure former President Trump feels the pain he has inflicted on our country:"}
{"original": "If you work at a company, belong to an organization or trade association or an institution of higher education, let your bosses know that you won't tolerate paying Trump to come speak at events, conferences or any sort of engagement. Don't wait until he's booked, let them know in advance that he's not welcome. If you are a lecture agency and take Trump on as a client, understand that your other clients will go elsewhere for representation."}
{"original": "We all buy books from the major publishers. Let them know you will no longer buy their books if they sign Trump to a book deal. Tell your local officials to stay away from Trump. No renaming of airports, highways or public buildings -- I might exclude toxic waste dumps and landfills from this list, however. If they don't listen, vote them out of office."}
{"original": "Make sure the Trump Organization is not afforded any the tax breaks for building in your community. And no donations of land for a Presidential library. Let him build it in the smoking room at Mar-a-Lago."}
{"original": "No awards or honors should be bestowed from your town, group or organization. No commencement speeches or honorary degrees from colleges and universities. In fact, following the example of Lehigh University, revoke a degree if it has already been awarded. If you are an author, make clear you won't work with publishers that do business with Trump."}
{"original": "No throwing out the first pitch at the World Series. No invitation to toss the coin for the Super Bowl or drop the ball at the World Cup. And Olympics -- forget about it. Want to get him where it really hurts? Pressure the golf governing bodies to sever all ties with him and his golf courses."}
{"original": "At a local club, make sure the pro knows they'll be no playing privileges. If he wants to play, he either has to own the course or join the hackers at the local public course. The PGA (who just announced the 2022 PGA Championship will not be played at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey) might offer him a deal -- privileges will be restored after a PGA official follows him for a year to record his real score and enter it into the handicap system."}
{"original": "If you work in the finance industry, tell your leadership they must say no to any requests for financing from the Trump Organization. If they hold debt, tell them to call it January 21. If you're an investor, tell your broker or bank just say no to Trump or your money will walk."}
{"original": "We can also pressure Congress to take further action. There is nothing in the Constitution that requires a former President be afforded the protection of the Secret Service. Also, nothing that says he deserves a million dollars a year for travel and a generous pension and healthcare plan. And of course, there should be no right to a state funeral."}
{"original": "Finally, and most importantly, show no tolerance for anyone in our judicial system who seeks special protection for crimes committed either before, after or during his presidency. Trump doesn't have to be found guilty of sedition to punished for his behavior. See the Al Capone example: By all accounts, Capone murdered dozens of people but only went to jail for tax evasion. And law firms that seek to help Trump can and should be boycotted by organizations large and small."}

{"original": "Trump must be held accountable for crimes against the state. We all have some power to help with holding him accountable and should not hesitate to use it going forward. Trump screwed up the most important job in the world -- president of the United States. Let's make sure he doesn't benefit now from the best job in the world -- former president of the United States. And for those who say this is cancel culture run amok, I say it's perfectly legal citizen justice well earned by Donald J Trump."}
{"original": "As a taxpayer, you have a couple of choices when it comes to filing your upcoming return: You can take the standard deduction, or itemize deductions in the hopes of snagging a better deal on your taxes."}
{"original": "If you opt for the former, you won't need to sink tons of time into calculating your various expenses and figuring out what each individual deduction you're entitled to is worth. Rather, you'll simply take a deduction based on your filing status. For example, single filers can claim a $6,350 standard deduction on their 2017 returns, while joint filers get a standard deduction of $12,700."}
{"original": "Now one thing you should know about the standard deduction versus itemize debate is that the overwhelming majority of tax filers go with the former, mostly because it ends up being the most lucrative. The danger of taking the standard deduction, however, is potentially losing out on extra tax savings that may come with itemizing."}
{"original": "But there's some good news: The IRS allows taxpayers to claim a number of deductions without actually itemizing on their returns. These deductions are known as adjustments to income or above-the-line deductions, since they appear on Form 1040 above your adjusted gross income. If you'd rather not itemize this year (meaning, on your 2017 return), here are a few key tax breaks you might benefit from nonetheless."}
{"original": "Many workers who don't have access to an employer-sponsored 401(k) opt to save in an IRA instead. If you're one of them, and neither you nor your spouse is covered by a retirement plan at work, then you'll get to deduct whatever contribution you made last year from your income. Keep in mind that it's actually not too late to fund your 2017 IRA if you haven't already maxed out. You have until the April 17 tax filing deadline to contribute up to $5,500 for the 2017 tax year if you're under 50, or up to $6,500 if you're 50 or older."}
{"original": "Though you need to meet certain criteria to be eligible to contribute to a health savings account, or HSA, if you put money into such an account last year, you can use those contributions to reduce your taxable income. Among other benefits, the money that goes into HSAs gets to grow tax-free, so if you have a high-deductible plan, it pays to see whether an HSA makes sense for you going forward."}
{"original": "If you moved for a job last year, let's hope you kept track of the expenses you incurred. That's because you're allowed to deduct costs such as hiring movers and paying for storage that helped you relocate for work purposes. To be eligible for the moving expense deduction, your new job must be at least 50 miles further away than your last job was from your old home. You're also required to work for at least 39 weeks out of the 52-week period following your move. But if you meet these criteria, you can deduct your moving costs even if you have no intention of itemizing. Keep in mind, however, that 2017 is the last tax year for which you can take this deduction, as it was eliminated under the recent tax overhaul."}
{"original": "If you're on the hook for alimony to a former spouse, you can deduct those payments on your 2017 taxes even without itemizing. But future divorcees may not get that option, as the alimony deduction will be eliminated for all divorces finalized after Dec. 31, 2018."}
{"original": "If you're a teacher, you've probably encountered your share of scenarios where you've had to buy classroom supplies using your own money. As long as you retained those receipts, you can deduct up to $250 worth of expenses on your tax return this year."}
{"original": "Depending on your income, you may be eligible to write off up to $2,500 in student loan interest on your tax return, regardless of whether you itemize. To snag this deduction, the loan in question must be one you took out to pay for your own higher education costs, or those of a spouse or dependent of yours. Furthermore, to deduct that interest, your tax filing status can't be married filing separately, and you can't be listed as a dependent on someone else's tax return."}

{"original": "1. The melt-up is over: One of Wall Street's biggest headaches could soon become its saving grace."}
{"original": "The bears growled for months about how expensive stocks became during the euphoria of late last year. And they had a point: Rarely in history have stocks been as pricey as they were during the recent boom."}
{"original": "Yet if there's a silver lining to the recent market chaos, it's that stocks no longer look absurdly overpriced. Heavy selling, driven largely by fears of trade wars and inflation, doused cold water on a market that had been overheating. The melt-up is over."}
{"original": "And that's not just because the Dow has fallen 2,500 points from its high point. It's that the market mayhem failed to shake the confidence of Wall Street."}
{"original": "Earnings estimates, a key indicator of stock prices, almost always decline each quarter as companies manage expectations lower (and then top those expectations anyway). Yet the opposite happened this time as analysts scrambled to assess the benefits of President Trump's corporate tax cuts."}
{"original": "Annual earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies jumped 7.1% during the first three months of the year — the most since FactSet (FDS) began keeping track in 1996. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 itself lost 1.2%."}
{"original": "That one-two combination caused Wall Street's favorite way of gauging stock valuations to drop — significantly."}
{"original": "The S&P 500 is now trading at 16.1 times projected earnings for the next year, according to FactSet. That's down dramatically from 18.6 in late January, when the Dow shot above 26,500. It's also back in line with the five-year average."}
{"original": "You have to take a step back and look at valuations, which have come down dramatically even as earnings forecasts have gone up, said Mary Ann Bartels, head of portfolio strategy at Merrill Lynch Wealth Management."}
{"original": "Corporate profits, buoyed by Trump's huge tax cuts and a strong economy, are projected to spike 18.5% this year."}
{"original": "Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, is encouraged by the more reasonable market valuations."}
{"original": "We believe the correction has likely run its course and is now working its jagged way back to breakeven, Stovall wrote to clients last week."}
{"original": "Of course, valuations are notoriously poor timing tools. Stocks that are pricey can stay that way, and vice versa. Consider how long it took for the market surge of 2017 to take a breather."}
{"original": "The key will be whether Corporate America delivers the blockbuster results that Wall Street is banking on. That would shift the attention away from the increasing turbulence out of Washington."}
{"original": "We're expecting earnings to be really strong, Bartels said. If they are, we can finally recover from this correction."}
{"original": "2. Second quarter kickoff: The second quarter is here, and investors are happy to turn the calendar page. The Dow lost more than 2% over the first three months of the year — snapping its longest quarterly streak in 20 years, and marking the worst performance since 2015."}
{"original": "Concerns over inflation caused the market to nosedive in early February. The Dow stabilized after a few volatile days, but has been pulled down more recently by fears of a trade war and a slump in tech stocks."}

{"original": "Why the Gilet Jaunes are going after Macron"}
{"original": "When French President Emmanuel Macron won the presidential election in May 2017, beating Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's far-right National Front, the markets heaved a sigh of relief."}
{"original": "The populist wave that had led the United Kingdom to vote to leave the European Union and that propelled Donald Trump to the White House appeared to have been stopped – at least in France."}
{"original": "Macron embraced this victory and presented himself as the new leader of the free world: a champion of a newly unfashionable multilateralist, globalist vision."}
{"original": "Having changed the French political landscape with his candidacy, which he ran on the independent ticket En Marche, Macron promised to fix Europe, fight climate change, stand up to the US and take on the populists gaining ground elsewhere in the EU."}
{"original": "So it is perhaps surprising that he should have been so slow to see the populist threat growing from within."}
{"original": "As the gilets jaunes or, yellow vests began appearing at roundabouts and toll booths around the country in early November, the government seemed deaf to the growing rumble of discontent. The protests – named for the yellow high-visibility jackets French motorists must carry in their vehicles – began as a reaction to an eco-tax on gas but have since morphed into a much more political protest against Macron."}
{"original": "Even after some 282,000 people took the streets at the first mass yellow vest protest on November 17, it seemed that Macron had neither a clear strategy on what to do, nor even a grasp of the looming crisis."}
{"original": "This reinforced the sense of a president out of touch with the common citizen, one insensitive to their plight."}
{"original": "As one political analyst, Alexis Poulain, told me at the time: Macron is the ultimate technocrat. He is at home in Davos. But here you have a man used to talking about millions of Euros, trying to listen to those counting in centimes. It cannot work."}
{"original": "Especially when those who count in centimes are suddenly calling the shots."}
{"original": "After weeks of protests that turned violent, Macron eventually introduced some concessions. First, a cancellation of the tax increase that had sparked the movement. Then, a 10 billion Euro (approximately US $11.5 billion) package of social reforms, including an increase in the minimum wage, aimed at helping the purchasing power of those least well-off."}
{"original": "But by then the damage was done."}
{"original": "The yellow vest movement, having felt it was being ignored, now felt it was winning. So why stop?"}
{"original": "Last Saturday, on the first weekend of 2019, the numbers of yellow vest protestors demonstrating on the streets were back up from the week prior, a suggestion that the yellow vests aren't done yet."}
{"original": "But while the movement has stayed strong, it has changed in its focus and is now looking to change in its form."}
{"original": "From a fiscal revolt, to a battle over spending power, the yellow vest movement is now calling for more power to be given to the people through mass popular votes or referenda d'initiative citoyenne (RIC)."}
{"original": "Next week, in yet another concession toward the protesters, Macron will send a letter to the public, outlining the themes of a big national debate."}
{"original": "The topics of that debate will span from spending power to the functioning of the institutions and climate change initiatives."}
{"original": "But even before that debate begins, the government has already ruled out a U-turn on Macron's reform agenda or institutional reform."}
{"original": "So, what can emerge if not dissatisfaction with the debate, argue some observers of French politics who warn of the dangers involved in the process itself."}
{"original": "By placing himself in a dialogue with the people, they say, Macron – having already destabilized France's representative democracy by the very nature of his candidacy – risks now taking on a mob that could yet force the dissolution of parliament and a set of legislative elections."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, some yellow vests have already decided to go into politics themselves, and are now preparing candidacy lists for the European elections this May. An Ipsos poll, ordered by Macron's party, showed those candidates could potentially win about 12% of the vote, mainly at the expense of the far-right and far-left."}
{"original": "Macron has long warned that he expects that poll to be decisive to the future of Europe."}
{"original": "Le Pen's far-right party is currently leading voting intentions in France. Other European populists, many of them Eurosceptics, are also expected to do well in May's election."}
{"original": "Now, another populist force looks set to enter the European Parliament, becoming a new force and feature of the political landscape in France."}
{"original": "Far from putting an end to the populist wave, Macron appears to have overseen its expansion."}

{"original": "Business spending on things like factories, software and new equipment jumped in the first quarter after the tax law took effect. But it has decelerated as companies worry about slowing global growth and rising trade tensions."}
{"original": "There hasn't been a huge surge in response to tax reform, said Eric Zwick, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business who studies the interaction between public policy and corporate behavior."}
{"original": "Real nonresidential fixed investment increased by just 2.5% in the third quarter, a sharp slowdown compared to 8.7% in the second quarter and 11.5% in the first quarter."}

{"original": "It now appears the investment recovery was short-lived, Ethan Harris, global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote in a report last week titled, The investment boom that wasn't."}
{"original": "The lack of investment comes despite the fact that the tax overhaul allows businesses to immediately write off the expense of capital spending. The law also gives companies a tax break on repatriated overseas profits."}
{"original": "That's not shocking, according to Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Companies were awash with cash before the tax cuts took effect. Capital spending wasn't guaranteed to take off simply because they had more of it."}
{"original": "History shows that repatriated earnings tend to be spent on buybacks and dividends, Shepherdson told CNN Business, adding that he saw no evidence at all that the tax cuts have lifted business spending above what would have happened anyway."}

{"original": "There has been a capital spending boom this year, Hassett said."}
{"original": "The tax cuts appear to have had a more dramatic impact on stock buybacks, which allow companies to return excess cash to shareholders."}

{"original": "One big X-factor is the price of oil. Business investment slowed significantly in late 2015 and 2016 as oil prices crashed. And the opposite happened in 2017 as oil prices rebounded."}

{"original": "The House and the Senate will meet today to formally count the Electoral College votes from the 2020 presidential election. But what is usually a routine part of American democracy could turn ugly because of President Trump and his most ardent supporters' ongoing refusal to accept the results. Here's what will happen : Some Republicans in both chambers have pledged to object to some results, which are counted state-by-state, meaning there may be debate when certain states come up. All objections will be voted on -- and are expected to fail. So in the end, GOP objections will most likely serve as a marker of loyalty to the President, rather than actually affect the results. They could also cast a shadow over future democratic processes and maintain the seed of doubt among Trump supporters who believe his false claims that the election was stolen from him. We could also see unrest, as Trump has encouraged supporters to come to the Capitol as the votes are counted."}

He said he used deadly force because he thought Blake was trying to kidnap a child in the back seat of a vehicle. Blake's family says they are disappointed in the decision but felt it was coming when they heard Wisconsin was bringing in the National Guard to respond to possible unrest following the announcement.

View more opinion at CNN."}
{"original": "In a bit of good news for those who want more (or at least some) substance in their politics, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, is attracting attention for her proposal to raise income tax rates on upper-income earners, all the way up to 70%. Granted, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is not getting as much attention for her tax policy as for her dancing, but at least the coverage of her tax ideas is a start toward talking about things that really matter."}
{"original": "And it is a good start. Ocasio-Cortez is pointing a spotlight on the pressing issue of economic inequality in America, and on the role of current American tax policy in fomenting it. To keep things short, the rich in America are really rich, and are getting richer, and our tax laws are helping them do it. That is not good for the health of our democracy. Ocasio-Cortez is right to demand change."}
{"original": "But the congresswoman's particular idea for change nonetheless falls short."}
{"original": "There are two broad dimensions to any tax system – what is being taxed, and at what rate. Ocasio-Cortez's proposal, like many Democratic plans, focuses only on the rate part."}
{"original": "And while it is true that America has had a 70% top income tax rate – which it got when our first great tax-cutting President, John F. Kennedy, cut the top rate from 90% – things did not work out so well for liberals under it. High earners used loopholes to avoid the rate."}
{"original": "Worse, high tax rates fueled a political revolution that led to Ronald Reagan's presidency. Reagan slashed the marginal rate on top earners all the way down to 28%, and it has stayed under (even if just under) 40% ever since. Reagan is still a hero to many for his anti-tax stance, and Democrats have been playing defense on tax policy for decades."}
{"original": "Does history and common sense thus dictate that progressivity in tax is dead? No. It just requires a bit more analysis."}
{"original": "The central problem today with the income tax is not its rate structure, but with what it covers – and what it doesn't cover. In particular, the income tax rates do not apply to unrealized appreciation, which is what happens when the rich get richer without so much as touching actual cash. To illustrate, the radical corporate income tax cuts in President Trump's signature tax bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, led to a rise in stock prices that benefitted stock owners, tax-free. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, for one ready example, got a one-time $29 billion windfall from Trump's tax cuts. As the principal owner, Buffett himself benefited to the tune of billions. But Buffett paid no tax on his very good day."}
{"original": "The fundamental flaw in the US tax system is that we tax wages, not wealth. If America were to follow Rep. Ocasio-Cortez's lead, high income workers would be facing higher taxes, up to 70% for those with more than $10 million of taxable income. Many upper-income earners would be tempted to move, or retire, or shift their financial plans to show fewer wages and all of them, as workers, are shouldering a hefty tax burden as is. Meantime, the truly rich, who do not have to work, or work in the ways ordinary folk do, would continue to pay nothing on their accumulated wealth. That's crazy."}
{"original": "Democrats should be looking to change what is being taxed, to move to a system, such as a progressive spending tax, that would make the truly rich, who now pay nothing, pay something."}

{"original": "Not convinced, ye liberals of little faith? Consider this. While we can and should admire Ocasio-Cortez's energy, passion, courage, intellect and ambition, her proposal to raise the top income tax rate to 70% would do nothing to those many American billionaires who pay little or no tax on their wealth. Two you may have heard of? How about Jared Kushner and President Donald J. Trump."}

{"original": "Imagine going to bed every night, having the same nightmare, waking up, hoping you will sleep peacefully the next night and then having the nightmare again. Over and over again. For 24 days and counting."}
{"original": "Welcome to the world of Republicans in Congress!"}
{"original": "Two things came into very clear focus over the past 96 hours:"}
{"original": "1) Republicans are losing the messaging war surrounding this longest government shutdown ever – and losing it badly"}
{"original": "2) With every passing day, President Donald Trump hunkers down deeper into his demand for $5 billion in federal funding to build a border wall with Mexico."}
{"original": "Those two realities are creating a slow-motion disaster for Republicans, the vast majority of whom – OK, everyone but Donald Trump – are powerless to do absolutely anything about it."}
{"original": "Let's break it down – point by point."}
{"original": "A series of national polls conducted and released over the past week leave no doubt that a majority of the public blames Trump and Republicans for the ongoing shutdown. In a CNN poll out over the weekend, 55% blamed Trump for the shutdown while 32% said it was congressional Democrats at fault. (A majority – 56% – opposed the construction of a wall along the entirety of the southern US border with Mexico.) In a Washington Post-ABC News poll from this weekend, the results were very similar; 53% said the shutdown blame falls primarily on Trump and Republicans while 29% blamed Democrats in Congress. There's plenty more recent polling that gets at that same idea: People blame Trump and Republicans for this shutdown and believe the cause of the shutdown – a border wall – won't solve the problems posed by immigration."}
{"original": "And yet, in the face of this avalanche of polling data – remember when Trump couldn't wait to tout the results of the latest poll in the 2016 GOP primary?? – Trump seems entirely unable or unwilling to bend. He's not going to budge even 1 inch, a source familiar with Trump's thinking told CNN's Jeremy Diamond on Monday. (That same source told Diamond that Trump keeps citing increased support for a border wall – 42% support for it in the WaPo-ABC poll – as evidence he is winning. Of course, 54% of people in that same poll oppose the wall, so …)"}
{"original": "Trump's tweets of late seem similarly detached from reality."}
{"original": "Nancy and Cryin' Chuck can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes, he typed Monday morning. At this point it has become their, and the Democrats, fault!"}
{"original": "This is all sorts of bad if you are a Republican elected official."}
{"original": "What we know from modern political history is that the public tends to blame one party for these shutdowns – unless they are of a very short duration. This one is not that. We also know that, barring some sort of major news event that upends conventional wisdom, once people make their minds up about who they think is at fault in government, they rarely change their collective minds."}
{"original": "If you are a congressional Republican, the feeling is somewhere between utter frustration and total futility. You know that every day this shutdown goes, things get worse for your party, politically speaking, You also know that telling Trump any of this makes him more likely to hunker down even further. And don't forget, you are a little – or more than a little – scared of the President's ire, and what it may mean for your political future."}
{"original": "What do do? Well, most Republicans have largely thrown up their hands. Take Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the man who, during past potential (and realized) shutdowns during the Obama administration, stepped in to cut a deal. He's been largely on the sidelines in this shutdown – by his own choosing."}
{"original": "Ultimately the solution to this is a deal between the president and Nancy and Chuck, because we need some of Chuck's votes, and obviously, we need Nancy's support, McConnell told Politico recently."}
{"original": "He's also made clear that unless and until Trump goes public with a specific legislative proposal, there's no point in having a series of show votes on the Senate floor for measures the President won't sign. (Left unsaid but without question a calculation for McConnell is putting his vulnerable 2020 members on the record with votes that will never go anywhere.)"}
{"original": "The truth here is that congressional Republicans threw their lot in with Trump – totally and completely – shortly after he won the White House. They did so because they thought doing so would get them what they wanted – tax cuts, conservative Supreme Court justices – even if it meant swallowing their pride and their past views on things like the danger posed by the rapidly growing national debt."}
{"original": "When they latched themselves to Trump, they did so for good and for bad. This moment – a flailing President unwilling to see he made a bad bet and who keeps throwing good political money after bad – was completely predictable. That doesn't make it any easier for congressional Republicans to endure; the President is lighting their political brand on fire while insisting everything is not only fine but that he is, in fact winning."}
{"original": "Debt is not always a bad thing. In fact, there are instances where the leveraging power of a loan actually helps put you in a better overall financial position. Here are a few:"}
{"original": "The chance that you can pay for a new home in cash is slim. Carefully consider how much you can afford to put down and how much loan you can carry. The more you put down, the less you'll owe and the less you'll pay in interest over time."}
{"original": "Although it may seem logical to spend every available dime to cut your interest payments, it's not always the best move. You need to consider other issues, such as your need for cash reserves and what your investments are earning."}
{"original": "Also, don't pour all your cash into a home if you have other debt. Mortgages tend to have lower interest rates than other debt, and you may deduct the interest you pay on the first $1 million of a mortgage loan. (If your mortgage has a high rate, you can always refinance later if rates fall. Use our mortgage calculator to determine how much you might save.)"}
{"original": "A 20% down payment is traditional and may help buyers get the best mortgage deals. Many homebuyers do put down less -- as little as 3% in some cases. But if you do, you'll end up paying higher monthly mortgage bills because you're borrowing more money, and you will have to pay for primary mortgage insurance (PMI), which protects the lender in the event you default."}
{"original": "For more on financing a home, read Money Essentials: Buying a home."}
{"original": "When it comes to paying for your children's education, allowing your kids to take loans makes far more sense than liquidating or borrowing against your retirement fund. That's because your kids have plenty of financial sources to draw on for college, but no one is going to give you a scholarship for your retirement. What's more, a big 401(k) balance won't count against you if you apply for financial aid since retirement savings are not counted as available assets."}
{"original": "It's also unwise to borrow against your home to cover tuition. If you run into financial difficulties down the road, you risk losing the house."}
{"original": "Your best bet is to save what you can for your kids' educations without compromising your own financial health. Then let your kids borrow what you can't provide, especially if they are eligible for a government-backed Perkins or Stafford loans, which are based on need. Such loans have guaranteed low rates; no interest payments are due until after graduation; and interest paid is tax-deductible under certain circumstances."}
{"original": "For more on educational financing, read Money Essentials: Saving for College."}
{"original": "It makes sense to pay for a car outright if you plan to keep it until it dies or for longer than the term of a high-interest car loan or pricey lease. It's also smart to use cash if that money is unlikely to earn more invested than what you would pay in loan interest."}
{"original": "Most people, however, can't afford to put down 100%. So the goal is to put down as much as possible without jeopardizing your other financial goals and emergency fund. Typically, you won't be able to get a car loan without putting down at least 10%. A loan makes most sense if you want to buy a new car and plan to keep driving it long after your loan payments have stopped."}
{"original": "You may be tempted to use a home equity loan when buying a car because you're likely to get a lower interest rate than you would on an auto loan, and the interest is tax-deductible. But make sure you can afford the payments. If you default, you could lose your home."}
{"original": "Leasing a car might be your best bet if the following applies: you want a new car every three or four years; you want to avoid a down payment of 10% to 20%; you don't drive more than the 15,000 miles a year allowed in most leases; and you keep your vehicle in good condition so that you avoid end-of-lease penalties."}
{"original": "For more on auto financing, read Money Essentials: Buying a car."}
{"original": "Taking a home equity loan or home equity line of credit makes sense if you're making home improvements that increase the value of your house, such as adding a family room or renovating your kitchen. The interest you pay in many cases is deductible, and you increase your equity."}
{"original": "If, however, a home project doesn't boost your house value, consider paying cash or taking out a short-term, low-interest loan that will be paid off in five years or less."}
{"original": "Generally speaking, it's best to pay up front for furniture and appliances since they don't add value to your home and are depreciating assets."}
{"original": "If you're saddled with a lot of high-interest credit card debt, you might be tempted to pay it off quickly by borrowing from your 401(k) or taking out a home equity loan."}
{"original": "There are two primary advantages to home equity loans: They typically charge interest rates that are less than half what most credit cards charge. Plus, the interest you pay may be deductible. (Note, however, that when you use a home equity loan for nonhousing expenses, you may only deduct the interest paid on the first $100,000 of the loan, according to the National Association of Tax Practitioners.)"}
{"original": "But there is one potential and very significant drawback when you borrow against your house to pay off credit cards: If you default on your home equity loan payments, you may lose your home."}
{"original": "Borrowing from your 401(k) is even less advisable. That's because you lose out on two of the biggest advantages to workplace retirement plans: tax-deferred compounding of your money and tax-deductible contributions. Sure, you pay yourself back with interest, but that interest is paid with after-tax dollars, and it will be harder for you to make new contributions while you're repaying your old loan."}
{"original": "Also, if you quit or lose your job, you'll probably have to repay the entire borrowed amount within three months. If you aren't able to do that, you'll owe income taxes on the money, plus a 10% penalty if you're under 59-1/2."}

{"original": "The city's roll at the time included only 988 voters, so it meant about one in five potential ballots. The majority-White board ultimately clipped 53 residents from the rolls."}
{"original": "Had Thornton and others not fought back, suing the BOER in federal court -- which in 2016 restored most voters to the rolls -- many county residents could have been disenfranchised, he said last month."}
{"original": "Johnny Thornton says his catfish farm in Mayfield is his official address, but the BOER insisted he didn't live there."}
{"original": "A lot of the individuals that they were targeting, they either worked out of town or did not have the means or resources to push back, said Thornton, a retired special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration. Voter suppression through administrative chaos is my term for it."}
{"original": "With Georgia voters set to decide control of the US Senate in Tuesday's runoffs , the challenges to the voting rolls in Hancock County, whose residents have long fought for their right to vote, remain under the supervision of a court-appointed examiner. Legal experts say the US Supreme Court pulling teeth from the Voting Rights Act is to blame."}
{"original": "The high court's 2013 ruling in Shelby County v.

Since the ruling, lawyers have filed lawsuits alleging voter suppression from Alabama to Alaska."}

{"original": "'They were making Black votes disappear'"}
{"original": "Thornton has means -- a rarity in a county where per capita income is $16,704, less than half the national average. He could afford a lawyer and federal court fees, whereas many other Black residents could not."}
{"original": "With 71% of its residents African American, Hancock is one of the Blackest counties not just in Georgia but in the nation. The percentage is even higher in Sparta, its county seat and only incorporated area."}
{"original": "The lawsuit highlighted disparities among the Black and White populations in 2015: Black households had a median income of $22,056 ($37,083 for White); almost 34% of Black residents lived in poverty (22% for White); and 26% of Black households received food benefits (6% for White)."}
{"original": "A man rides a bike through downtown Sparta last month."}
{"original": "Ahead of the 2015 Sparta elections, the lawsuit said, BOER Vice Chairwoman Nancy Stephens, who is White, began filing voter challenges as a citizen, then voting on them as a board member. When concerns were raised, a local resident began filing challenges in a format that closely resembled the format of those filed by the Vice Chair, the lawsuit said."}
{"original": "The challengers consistently failed to provide credible evidence based upon personal knowledge that the challenged voters were not qualified to vote, the lawsuit said. The BOER frequently accepted hearsay, speculation, and unsubstantiated rumors provided by unnamed witnesses and anonymous individuals as sufficient evidence to remove registered Black voters."}
{"original": "Stephens, who is no longer vice chair but remains a BOER member, referred questions to county attorney Andrea Grant, who did not return a phone call to discuss past and present concerns residents expressed."}
{"original": "The BOER, responding to the lawsuit, vigorously and strenuously denied illegally targeting Black voters or violating state laws."}
{"original": "Thornton can't understand why the BOER would claim he didn't live in the county, or why the board would try to remove him from the rolls. His catfish farm is in unincorporated Mayfield, 20 minutes outside Sparta, and he wasn't eligible to vote in the city elections. What's more, he receives bills at his catfish farm, which is the address on his driver's license. He also served as county NAACP treasurer and on the Sparta Housing Authority. He owns property outside the county but spends most of his time at the catfish farm, hunting and doing maintenance."}
{"original": "His attorney informed the elections supervisor that he could not appear before the board and would be out of town for several weeks, he said. The board removed him anyway, according to the lawsuit."}
{"original": "Word moves quickly in Hancock County, especially when deputies are delivering summonses. Larry Webb heard the BOER was removing Black voters from the rolls and began attending meetings."}
{"original": "Sitting after two of the meetings, I thought, 'What would they do if someone challenged some White voters?' recalled Webb, who is Black."}
{"original": "Larry Webb, seen last month at his Powelton home, decided to begin challenging White voters at the BOER meetings."}
{"original": "He went through the 2014 voting roll and pulled voters he knew were dead or had moved and submitted 14 challenges. Emails included in the lawsuit revealed BOER members didn't take Webb's challenges seriously and defended White voters. According to the lawsuit, Chairwoman Kathy Ransom wrote of Webb's challenges, Just a guess...he's targeting folks that are 'white' :)"}
{"original": "Webb asked for deputies to serve summonses to the residents he challenged, but he was told the sheriff's department was now charging $50 each, he said. When Webb's 14 challenges finally went before the board, Ransom told the White resident who had been challenging Black voters that deputies would no longer serve his summonses as a courtesy, as they had in the past, the lawsuit said."}
{"original": "The BOER determined before the hearing that four of Webb's challenged voters were dead and removed them from the rolls. Of the remaining challenges, the board nixed one voter from the rolls and moved another to inactive status. Both were Asian American, the lawsuit said."}
{"original": "What they did was beyond voter suppression. If something is wrong with your voter registration, they should call you and tell you what's wrong. What they were doing is taking you off the rolls, and you wouldn't find out until the election, Webb told CNN. They were making Black votes disappear."}
{"original": "In Shelby County v. Holder , the US Supreme Court ruled that the coverage formula dictating which jurisdictions were subject to preclearance in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was unconstitutional. The formula, the court said in its 5-4 ruling, was based on 40-year-old facts having no logical relation to the present day."}
{"original": "Since the death of the Georgia civil rights icon US Rep. John Lewis, politicians and activists have called for Congress to honor Lewis by crafting an updated coverage formula , as permitted by the high court, but it hasn't come to pass."}
{"original": "Without the formula, which forced jurisdictions with a history of discrimination, most of them Southern, to prove proposed changes to voting laws did not discriminate against minorities, many jurisdictions undertook changes to their elections procedures that voting rights experts say have a disproportionate impact on minorities."}
{"original": "The Hancock County Courthouse was rebuilt in 2014 after fire consumed much of the structure built starting in 1881."}
{"original": "Julie Houk with the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, who worked on the Hancock County case, disagrees with the Supreme Court's finding that the conditions that originally justified these measures no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions."}
{"original": "Why then did jurisdictions across the South and beyond immediately take actions that would have otherwise required preclearance under the previous iteration of the Voting Rights Act?"}
{"original": "Texas and North Carolina moved to stiffen voter ID laws, which already hampered Black and Latino voters, Houk said. The Lawyers' Committee has also challenged restrictive absentee ballot rules and fought voter purges, redistricting decisions and efforts to limit ballot drop boxes -- which tend to burden minorities the most."}
{"original": "In Macon-Bibb County, Georgia, Houk said, elections officials moved a Black voting precinct -- in a community that had rocky relations with law enforcement -- to the sheriff's office, which she called very problematic as it threatened to dissuade African Americans from voting. The Lawyer's Committee got the precinct moved, she said."}

{"original": "Numerous groups have reported added hardships on Georgia's minority voters since the US Supreme Court decision. American Public Media reporters found in 2019 that tens of thousands of voters state officials said had likely died or moved away had, in fact, not."}
{"original": "The ACLU of Georgia reported in September that of 313,243 voters removed from the state rolls in 2019, almost 200,000 were likely erroneously purged . While the secretary of state said it was routine maintenance, removing voters it had classified as inactive, Andrea Young, state ACLU executive director, countered that the state's method of maintenance was prone to tremendous error."}
{"original": "A voting sign lays in the grass last month outside a home on the outskirts of Sparta."}

{"original": "'Way past problems with Black and White'"}
{"original": "Even with all the battles unfolding in Georgia and across the nation, Hancock County stands out, experts say."}
{"original": "Houk's colleague at the Lawyers' Committee, John Powers, who previously reviewed preclearance submissions for the US Justice Department, told a webzine in 2016 the Hancock County case was the worst case of voter suppression that I have ever seen."}
{"original": "Hancock County is just one example and probably one of the worst examples of how Shelby County is impacting individual voters, Houk said. This type of change in process would've been governed by preclearance. It would've stopped this whole process. ... This is why preclearance was so important: Discriminating against Black voters would've been rejected."}
{"original": "Sparta Mayor Allen Haywood defends the BOER, saying it was trying only to clean the rolls."}
{"original": "While the county voluntarily entered into a consent decree, agreeing to the appointment of an examiner to oversee any changes to its voting rolls, Sparta Mayor Allen Haywood insists the agreement was unnecessary. There was no racist intent in the board's work, he said."}
{"original": "The truth about 2015 depends on what side you talk to, he said. No candidate could win in the city, now estimated at 89% African American, without securing a swath of the Black vote, said Haywood, who is White and is certain he was elected on his promise of reform, he said."}
{"original": "The board of elections was just trying to clean the rolls, he said. It's not a racial problem except for those who want to keep it that way. People just want to see a change here. They knew that if I got in, I was going to make things transparent."}

{"original": "Once fat on cotton and timber, Hancock was one of the richest counties in the state. It had a progressive reputation. Black residents, who have long been the majority, could own land and aspire, according to the book, Black Boss: Political Revolution in a Georgia County."}
{"original": "After cotton crumbled, Hancock was destitute, the book explains. Before the Voting Rights Act of 1965, it had no Black elected officials until John McCown -- an activist more in the mold of Stokely Carmichael than Martin Luther King Jr. -- came to town, luring investment and ushering Black residents to power"}
{"original": "By 1968, Hancock was the first US county since Reconstruction to come under Black political control, in large part because of the charismatic leadership of McCown, who became county commissioner, the book says. By the mid-1970s, African Americans held almost every elected office."}
{"original": "McCown remains revered among many Black residents, despite investigations into his alleged misspending of grant money and other improprieties. They consider his achievements landmarks, including an affordable housing project and job creators like a cinder block factory and Thornton's now-defunct catfish farm. McCown's antebellum home still stands , abandoned and in need of upkeep."}
{"original": "Thornton examines an old aerial photograph of his property, when it was a functioning catfish farm in Hancock County."}
{"original": "McCown's efforts weren't always well received by White folks, many residents also recall, and when tensions flared over desegregation in 1971, the city and McCown's hunting club went on machine gun-buying sprees that required the intervention of Gov. Jimmy Carter and the US Justice Department, UPI reported"}
{"original": "A 1976 plane crash killed McCown, and a federal investigation into his fundraising killed the county's resurrected prosperity, but his legacy survived in the Black leaders succeeding him."}
{"original": "He created a political strategy, and African Americans voted themselves into power, Thornton said. It has come to a point where (Hancock County) is one of the most impoverished in America. There is a wives' tale -- I don't know if it's true or not -- that some political leaders in Georgia have always said that if we can't vote the people of Hancock County out, we'll starve them out -- and there's been a disproportionate lack of growth to this particular community."}
{"original": "'Folks decided voting wasn't worth it'"}
{"original": "The BOER strenuously denied that it was illegally targeting Black voters with its challenges but agreed to enter the consent decree and abide by the standards and procedures the decree lays out. The court also ordered the defendants to pay more than $500,000 in attorneys' fees and other expenses, court documents show."}
{"original": "As part of the consent decree, the BOER agreed to not engage in discriminatory challenges to voters' eligibility, and to adhere to certain procedures in such challenges, according to court documents. It also restored certain voters to its rolls and agreed not to take action on other voters restored to the rolls for at least two federal election cycles."}
{"original": "The decree also outlined the appointment of an examiner, who will review the BOER's actions regarding list maintenance and voter challenges based on residency and make recommendations on how to comply with state law and the consent decree, a court order says."}
{"original": "If the BOER disagrees with or does not follow the recommendations any party may bring that issue to the Court's attention, the decree says."}
{"original": "Atlanta attorney R. Gary Spencer was named examiner in June 2018. His term will run to December 2021. The consent decree will not expire until early 2023."}
{"original": "Former Sparta registrar Marion Warren began filming the BOER meetings after he learned of the voter challenges."}
{"original": "Butler considers the consent decree a victory preserving the legacy of Black empowerment in Hancock County, but it did not come without some casualties, she said."}
{"original": "It had a chilling effect on voters, she said. A lot of folks decided voting wasn't worth it."}
{"original": "Despite the voting rolls growing by a few dozen electors since 2012, she laments that many voters were intimidated by the deputies and the summonses. They still haven't returned to the polls. Several residents -- including Thornton, Webb and former Sparta registrar Marion Warren -- each know multiple voters who never voted again after the deputies came to their homes, they say."}
{"original": "It will affect several elections down the road because people will say that I'm not going to be bothered by this ever again. I'm not going to vote, Warren said. You have virtually destroyed their whole trust in the system altogether."}
{"original": "Aside from Stephens, Robert Ingram, who is Black and now chairs the board, is the only remaining member of the 2015 BOER. He did not return a message from a CNN reporter seeking to discuss present-day ramifications to the 2015 challenges. The federal lawsuit cites a half dozen Black voters he defended during the challenges."}
{"original": "Hancock County has been sort of noneventful since Spencer was appointed examiner, he said. The county has submitted voters it wants removed, as instructed, and during the November election, the NAACP seemed to think everything went OK, he said."}
{"original": "Spencer's team is always concerned, he said, and events happening at the state and national level, including Georgia's secretary of state calling to end no-excuse absentee voting and President Donald Trump challenging elections results, only exacerbate his worry."}
{"original": "At this point, however, he has seen nothing in Hancock County that would spur him to request an extension to his term or the consent decree, but before making any final decision, I would certainly check on it just to do some due diligence."}
{"original": "Thornton and others remain worried. The county is playing with house money, he said. Where Thornton shelled out his own earnings to defend his right to vote, the county used his tax dollars to fight him. Again, he emphasized, most Hancock County residents don't have his resources."}
{"original": "I am definitely worried that once the consent decree ends that the BOER will start its same antics again, he said. They can say, 'Hey, we'll get everybody except Johnny Thornton, and the other people that we go for might not have the legal means or expertise to push back or to fight against the system.'"}

He had trouble last year, he said, when applying for a mail-in ballot. A county elections official told him his home wasn't his registered address, he said."}
{"original": "He isn't alleging any misbehavior -- he was able to sort it out before the general election -- but such a county notice might have been enough to deter a less-resolute voter from casting her or his ballot. In poor, rural areas like Hancock County, minor hiccups such as a rainy day or a washed-out road can have major effects on voting."}
{"original": "Because there is so little work in the county, people work multiple jobs or leave the county for employment, making it difficult to find time to vote, he said.

{"original": "It's common to focus on income as the deciding factor for wealth, but income doesn't tell the whole story."}
{"original": "Consider the perennial news articles about sports stars and actors who've declared bankruptcy despite their multimillion-dollar salaries; they have super-high incomes, yet can't even pay their bills."}
{"original": "That's why net worth is a much more realistic and accurate measure of your wealth."}
{"original": "Net worth is the value of everything you own, minus everything you owe. It's entirely possible for someone with a very low income to have a substantial net worth, if they're careful about debt and save money regularly. It's equally possible for someone with a very high income -- like those bankrupt sports stars -- to spend every penny they make and then some, resulting in a negative net worth."}
{"original": "Wealth has several possible definitions; open up your dictionary and you'll probably see at least five or six. The one that probably comes closest to the way we think of wealth in the context of being wealthy is this one from Dictionary.com: an abundance or profusion of anything; plentiful amount."}
{"original": "Being wealthy boils down to having more money than you need. And that's why net worth is a better determiner of wealth than income: your income doesn't say anything about how much money you have available right now, it just says how much money will be coming in on a periodic basis. Net worth is how much you have in cash and other assets to spend today, and if you have more money available to spend today than you need, you are by definition wealthy."}
{"original": "Figuring out your net worth is not complicated, although it may take some time. First, add up all the money and money-equivalent assets you have: checking accounts, savings accounts, investment accounts, retirement accounts, the money in your wallet, and the spare change in the cracks between your couch cushions."}
{"original": "Next, add up the value of your physical possessions. Your house would be on this list of course (assuming you own it) but so would your car, furniture, artwork, jewelry, TVs, and so on. To get an absolutely accurate net worth number you would include every single thing you own down to that sock in your drawer that's missing its partner, but you don't need to go into that much detail to get a reasonably close total; you can limit your tally to your more valuable possessions."}
{"original": "And remember, the things you own are not valued at what you paid for them but what you could sell them for today. Finally, add up the total amount of your debts and subtract this number from the value of your cash and everything you own. The easiest way to total up your debts is to pull a copy of your credit report, subtract any payments you've made that aren't yet reflected on the report, and use that number."}
{"original": "What is a good net worth?"}
{"original": "The book The Millionaire Next Door suggests the following formula to calculate what your net worth should be:"}
{"original": "(Age x Annual Pre-tax Income) / 10 = Target Net Worth"}
{"original": "Using this formula, a 40-year-old man with an annual pre-tax income of $60,000 per year would calculate his target net worth as 40 x 60,000÷10, or $240,000. If this number looks really, really high to you, you're not alone: the average American falls far short of the target net worth indicated in this formula. According to US census data, 40-year-olds actually have a median net worth of about $35,000, not $240,000."}
{"original": "Setting your own target net worth"}
{"original": "The first step in growing your net worth is setting a goal for yourself. If you set a goal, you can also create a specific plan that will take you to that goal; if you don't have a goal, how can you decide what to do next? For example, let's say that you are the 40-year-old in the previous example and your net worth is $40,000. You're doing a bit better than the average, but you really want to get your net worth up to where the formula from the book says it should be, which is $240,000. You need to increase your net worth by $200,000 to get there. Now that you have a specific number, you can set a timeframe and mini-goals to get you to your ultimate goal no later than your deadline."}
{"original": "How to increase your net worth"}
{"original": "To increase your net worth, you need to increase your assets, decrease your debt, or (preferably) both. The fastest way to increase your assets is to pump up your retirement contributions. Because the money you put in a 401(k) or IRA can grow tax-free, you can get a slightly better return than you would on the exact same investments in a standard brokerage account."}
{"original": "Plus, your contributions to traditional retirement accounts are tax-deductible, so you can turn around and use the money you save on taxes to increase your net worth further. Decreasing your debt is a worthwhile goal for a lot of reasons, especially if you have a lot of expensive credit card debt or other high interest debt. In fact, getting rid of high interest debt is a higher priority than bumping your retirement contributions, because the interest you pay on your debt will more than cancel out the returns you get on your retirement savings."}
{"original": "A plan for increasing net worth"}
{"original": "Let's say you want to increase your net worth by $200,000 and you've decided to set a timeframe of 15 years. For the purposes of this example, you have $5,000 of credit card debt at 18% interest but other than that, your only debt is a low-interest mortgage. The first step in the plan would be to get rid of the credit card debt, and you decide that your goal is to pay it off within one year. You fire up a debt calculator and discover that if you pay an extra $400 per month on your credit card over and above the minimum payment, you'll have it paid off in 11 months. You scrape together the extra $400 by cutting back on expenses, and get it paid off on schedule (don't forget to reward yourself for reaching your first goal!)."}
{"original": "Now you've got an extra $400 every month cleared from your budget, so why not start putting that $400 toward your retirement contributions? Assuming that you have $20,000 in retirement savings now and you've been contributing just $100 per month, increasing your contributions to $500 per month means that with an average annual return of 7%, your retirement savings balance will grow to $196,345 in 14 years. Since you'll also be paying down your mortgage over those 14 years, that should be more than enough to get you to your target net worth even if your house doesn't increase in value at all."}

{"original": "There's a personal finance maxim that says a home mortgage is a good debt. This means that you should buy assets that appreciate in value, in this case your home. Home loans these days are often locked in at a low interest rate and offer tax deductible interest. Home loans are good because they free up your liquid cash so you can invest in other funds that could yield higher returns."}
{"original": "That being said, not all mortgages are a good deal."}
{"original": "I'd want to get a better understanding of why it makes you anxious, Ma notes. Is it a 30 year fixed rate mortgage or an adjustable rate mortgage? Do you currently have a high interest rate on the loan or are the monthly payments higher than you'd like?"}

{"original": "Put your loan in context to other priorities"}
{"original": "Make sure you clarify your financial goals and what you'd get out of paying off a mortgage early: Is your interest rate too high? Is there a chance you''ll move? What works for you might not work for someone else, so it's important to consider your life circumstances: How is your job security? What is your family's overall spending? Do you have some money set aside for emergencies? Is there potential for relocation? Inheritance?"}
{"original": "Paying off a mortgage is great, but it needs to be weighed against a multitude of other factors, particularly when there is only so much discretionary cash to go around, says Juan C. Ros of Lamia Financial Group, Inc. If they plan to move in 5 or 10 years, why pay off the mortgage early? That's cash that can be redirected for other purposes. Mortgage pay-off is generally low on the priority list if available cash is limited."}

The law's future is at the center of the Democratic presidential primary, with more moderate candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg saying they want to expand on Obamacare by allowing Americans to buy into a Medicare-style public insurance option. More progressive candidates like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren say they favor scrapping private insurance altogether for a government-run single-payer Medicare for All system."}
{"original": "New York (CNN Business) The federal government didn't act aggressively enough in 2009 to fight the Great Recession. And the economic recovery was weaker as a result."}

{"original": "Crucially, Biden is proposing spending big, for the first time during this pandemic, on the health crisis itself. His plan calls for $400 billion to keep schools open, speed up vaccinations and improve testing."}
{"original": "One of the lessons of 2009 was that the argument that you could start modestly and then keep adding if the economy did not improve ran into a political reality, Austan Goolsbee, a former Obama economic adviser, told CNN Business. President-elect Biden was there. You can already see they're not going to repeat that scenario."}
{"original": "If enacted -- and that's a huge if -- the US economy would grow by a sizzling 8% in 2021 and the job market would return to nearly full employment by the fall of 2022, according to projections by Mark Zandi, chief economists at Moody's Analytics."}
{"original": "However, Biden's stimulus plan will face opposition in Congress. Zandi expects Biden's American Rescue Plan will get whittled down to just $750 billion. That in turn would leave US GDP growth at about 5%."}
{"original": "Goldman Sachs is a bit more optimistic. After Biden released his plan, the Wall Street bank raised its estimate of fiscal relief from $750 billion to $1.1 trillion. And Goldman Sachs now expects US GDP growth of 6.6% this year, up from 5.9% before Democrats took control of the US Senate."}
{"original": "One vexing problem for Biden is how to convince lawmakers -- and the public -- to add to America's $27 trillion pile of debt. Republicans cast aside their debt concerns to pass the Trump tax cuts and bipartisan spending surges, but deficit hawks are going to make their voices heard again -- as they did during the Obama era."}
{"original": "There's no doubt that the United States faces an unsustainable fiscal situation. But the Biden team is arguing now is not the time to worry about the debt."}

{"original": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's recent proposal to create a 70% tax bracket on income over $10 million will not become law anytime soon. But the proposal, which would only affect fewer than one in every 1,000 households, has sparked a long overdue discussion about taxing the wealthy. Raising taxes on the rich is the right idea at the right time, but some ways to do so are better than others."}
{"original": "Why should the rich pay more than they already do? First, we need the money, and higher taxes are the only way to get wealthy Americans to bear non-trivial amounts of the fiscal burden. Currently, the economy is at full employment, but the government is running substantial deficits. Low revenues are a big part of the problem; they do not come close to funding current spending. As an aging population pushes up Social Security and Medicare spending in the future, both projected deficits and the need for higher revenues will increase, even if policymakers cut spending somewhat."}
{"original": "Second, high-income households have enjoyed skyrocketing incomes over the past 40 years, but their average tax rates have remained relatively constant. From 1979 to 2015, average market income for those in the top 1% rose by 233%, from $552,000 to $1.84 million (in 2015 dollars). But federal taxes as a share of their income have fallen — from 35% in 1979 to 33% in 2015 — and the 2017 tax cuts reduced them further. In a progressive system like ours, the tax share of income should rise as income rises. High-income households are due for a significant increase in tax burdens."}
{"original": "Third, higher tax burdens on the wealthy would reduce (what economists call) rent seeking, the appropriation of wealth from others without creating new wealth. Studies have shown that countries with lower top marginal tax rates have higher pre-tax income inequality. The logic is that, while lower tax rates on high-income households — introduced in the Reagan, Bush and Trump tax cuts — may have stimulated labor supply and saving, they also raised the return to rent seeking, encouraging, for example, executives to capture a larger share of profits, at the expense of wage earners. Thus, some of the top 1%'s impressive gains may well have come at the expense of, rather than benefit to, the rest of the population."}
{"original": "How to raise taxes on the rich is just as important as why. Simply raising the top rate to 70% would in essence be a full-employment act for tax planners and would create massive sheltering activity. Yes, the top rate was 70% or higher in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, but tax avoidance also thrived."}
{"original": "In many ways, the world is a better place than it was 50 years ago ... but it's certainly more complicated, especially when it comes to personal finance."}
{"original": "While the multitude of financial tools we now have at our disposal can be extremely helpful, they can also make our lives considerably more expensive when we make poor choices about them. And even sound financial decision-making can't save you from all the money problems that plague us these days."}
{"original": "While specialty credit cards such as the Diners Club card have been around for a while, general-purpose credit cards are a more recent addition to our wallets. The first general-purpose credit card, the BankAmericard (now known as Visa), appeared on the scene in 1966. In the years since, credit cards have proliferated to the point where the average American now holds 2.6 credit cards -- and $8,377 in credit card debt."}
{"original": "How to fix it: If you're stuck with a lot of credit card debt, getting it paid off can seem about as easy as eating an elephant. The solution for both problems is the same: stay calm and tackle the problem one bite at a time. Temporarily cutting back on nonessential expenses can help a lot, because the faster you pay off that debt, the less interest you'll pay and therefore the less money you'll need to pay off the whole thing."}
{"original": "Once upon a time, everyone worked for the same company their whole working lives, and at the end of their career they retired with a fat pension. Today, only 32% of retirees have any pension at all, and that number is trending steeply downward as employer pensions continue to vanish. That means the responsibility for financing a worker's retirement falls almost entirely on the worker. And given how bad Americans are at saving money, a lot of retirees run into serious income shortages as a result."}
{"original": "How to fix it: The earlier you start saving for retirement, the easier it will be: Money that sits in your retirement account for decades has plenty of time to be fruitful and multiply. If you didn't start saving right away, though, your case is definitely not hopeless. You'll just have to work a little harder to squeeze more cash out of your budget and be disciplined about paying yourself first. Luckily, workers today have access to powerful tax-advantaged retirement accounts, like 401(k)s and IRAs, that can help maximize whatever savings they manage to accrue."}
{"original": "While identity theft in one form or another is probably as old as mankind, it didn't become a significant issue until fairly recently. For example, the rise of credit cards meant that fraudsters could simply steal someone's wallet and go on a spending spree with their cards instead of being limited to whatever cash was in the victim's possession. And computers and the internet provide fraudsters with unprecedented access to sensitive financial information. In 2016 alone, 15.4 million Americans were victims of identity theft."}
{"original": "How to fix it: The first step in preventing identity theft is making it hard for people to get at your financial information. Even presenting something of a challenge makes it likely that fraudsters will go elsewhere in search of easier prey. Checking your credit report on a regular basis can also help you catch any fraud early on, thereby minimizing its magnitude."}
{"original": "The healthcare industry has made huge scientific advances in the past 50 years, but all that work has come at a very literal cost. In 1967, Americans spent $43.5 billion on healthcare expenses. In 2016, we spent $3.4 trillion, which adds up to about $10,350 per person. That's a whole lot more of an increase than inflation alone can explain -- and far more than most people can afford."}
{"original": "How to fix it: Health insurance is a financial necessity these days; virtually no one can pay such high healthcare costs unassisted. You can save quite a bit on insurance premiums by picking up a high-deductible plan paired with an HSA, then putting enough in the HSA to cover at least one year's deductible. That way, you'll have enough saved up to pay for any medical expenses until the insurance plan kicks in and takes over for you."}

{"original": "Then comes the important part: backers of BAT bet that once it goes into effect, the U.S. dollar will very quickly rise in value."}
{"original": "They say the dollar will rise 20% to 25% because, among other factors, the reform would make U.S. exports more affordable for foreign buyers. That would increase demand for U.S. products, and higher demand would raise the value of the dollar."}
{"original": "A higher dollar also means that imported goods will be cheaper, so American consumers won't have to pay more. It will even out."}
{"original": "So nobody really wins or loses in terms of jobs and prices. But companies would still have a tax incentive to produce in the U.S."}
{"original": "On the other hand, critics of a BAT don't believe the dollar will go up enough, and they say Americans will get hurt with higher prices for clothes, TVs and computers, and no guarantee that more jobs are created."}

{"original": "And these may not be the only taxes you'll pay, either. Social Security benefits won't be taxed if your income is below a certain threshold, but taking 401(k) distributions could push you above that limit, so your benefits become taxable."}
{"original": "Your distributions could also raise your income high enough that your Medicare monthly premiums rise."}
{"original": "How could this impact your total income?"}
{"original": "50% of your Social Security benefits will become taxable if your income exceeds $25,000 for a single filer or $32,000 for married filers. Income for these purposes includes half of Social Security income plus all taxable income from other sources plus some, but not all, tax-free income."}
{"original": "85% of your Social Security benefits will become taxable if your income exceeds $34,000 for a single person or $44,000 for a married person."}
{"original": "If your modified adjusted gross income goes above $85,000 for single filers or $170,000 for married filers, your Medicare Part B premiums could be anywhere from $53.50 to $294.60 more per month than the standard premium, depending upon income. Part D Premiums could also increase anywhere from $13.30 to $76.20 above plan premiums."}
{"original": "If your benefits weren't being taxed but will be after you take your 401(k) distribution, you'll substantially increase your total tax bill -- and your 401(k) contributions will provide much less additional spendable income since you'll have to use more of your money to pay the government."}
{"original": "Is there anything you can do to avoid taxes eating into your 401(k)?"}
{"original": "When you have a 401(k), you can't just leave the money invested to avoid taxes -- you have to comply with rules for required minimum distributions or else get heavily penalized by the IRS."}
{"original": "However, one option you have is to roll over the money in your 401(k) to a Roth IRA."}
{"original": "There's a big caveat: If you're rolling over money contributed to a 401(k) with pre-tax funds, you must pay taxes on the money rolled over in the year of the conversion -- which can mean a big tax bill. However, you could split the process up over several years to keep from pushing yourself into a much higher tax bracket and to limit the amount of taxes you must pay at one time."}
{"original": "And, once the conversion is complete, as long as you follow rules for withdrawals, your distributions from your Roth 401(k) should be tax free -- and won't count as income for purposes of determining if you owe Social Security taxes. You also won't be required to take RMDs any more, so you can take out money on your own schedule instead of on a schedule the government has set for you."}
{"original": "A Roth conversion isn't for everyone, especially because of the large tax bill that must be paid at the time of conversion. Still, if you're concerned about how much taxes will reduce the value of your 401(k) throughout your retirement and want to take care of tax issues in a lump sum, conversion may be a good option."}
{"original": "Making your 401(k) last during retirement"}
{"original": "If you're still young and you expect that your tax bracket will be higher during retirement than while you're working, you may wish to invest in a Roth 401(k) throughout your career -- if your employer offers one. You could also contribute to a Roth IRA, provided you're eligible, so you'd have money you could withdraw tax-free as a senior."}

{"original": "If you're already nearing retirement, it's important to consider how much taxes will eat away at the value of your 401(k) -- either over time, or if you pay a big tax bill for a Roth conversion -- so you can decide if your account balance is really big enough -- after tax -- to sustain you during your golden years."}
{"original": "(CNN) When President Joe Biden sat down after his inauguration to sign a slew of executive orders , alongside the stack of navy folders was a wooden box, situated within easy reach."}
{"original": "Inside that box, ready for use, lay a neat row of gold-trimmed navy Cross Century II pens."}
{"original": "But why so many pens? As Biden continues to sign more executive orders -- 17 on Wednesday alone, and 13 more in the days following -- it raises a question: Is one not enough?"}
{"original": "Well, like everything to do with the White House, it's mainly because of tradition."}
{"original": "It's not clear which president started using multiple pens to sign single pieces of legislation. But historians do know the tradition stretches across decades. After the pens are used, they are typically handed out to those involved as a sort of historical artifact."}
{"original": "It's a way to share the spotlight and acknowledge the contributions of others, explained Mark Lawrence, the director of the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library."}
{"original": "I think that presidents want to share credit with others who've contributed to the issues in play, he said."}
{"original": "One of the most famous examples of this is when Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act in 1964. He reportedly used at least 75 pens to sign the landmark legislation, handing them out to those involved."}
{"original": "While holding multiple pens, President Lyndon Johnson greets the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at the signing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act."}
{"original": "But the pens weren't just given out of benevolence. The first pen used to sign the CRA was given to Everett Dirksen, a Republican Senator from Illinois who helped write the act. The move was a politically shrewd one, Lawrence explained. Because Dirksen was on the other side of the aisle, the gesture might create a sense of loyalty to Johnson, and maybe Dirksen would speak favorably of him to his Republican peers."}
{"original": "It's a small gesture, no doubt, Lawrence said. But a very characteristic one for a skillful politician like (Johnson) to lose no chance to cultivate loyalty and support."}
{"original": "The second pen, he said, went to Hubert Humphrey, his vice president. Martin Luther King Jr. was also among the recipients."}
{"original": "And if you're wondering how it's possible to use that many pens, you can watch the video footage -- Johnson seemingly uses a new pen for each letter. The signatures may have gotten a little elaborate at times, in an effort to use all the pens, Lawrence predicted."}
{"original": "I mean, it must be a mess, he said."}
{"original": "But the pens weren't just given out at signing ceremonies. After Johnson signed the Tax Bill in 1964, he brought four of the pens used in the signing to Jacqueline Kennedy, according to a diary entry from Johnson's wife, Lady Bird Johnson. One pen was for Kennedy, one for the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum and one each for her children, Caroline and John-John, she wrote."}
{"original": "A more modern example is when President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in 2010, using 22 pens in the process."}
{"original": "And Obama had practice. In 2009, when he signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act -- the very first bill he signed into law -- he used seven pens."}
{"original": "I've been practicing, he quipped at the time. Very slowly."}
{"original": "As he signed, he gave the pens out as gifts, including to Ledbetter herself."}
{"original": "President Barack Obama hands Lilly Ledbetter a pen after signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act during an event in the East Room of the White House January 29, 2009 in Washington, DC."}
{"original": "Trump broke tradition with his preferred pen"}
{"original": "Of course, it's not just the number of pens that matters, but the type."}
{"original": "Biden, for example, reinvoked tradition by using a Cross pen, specifically the Cross Century II, according to manufacturer A.T. Cross."}
{"original": "Former president Donald Trump initially used the Century II felt tip pen, but then -- like so many facets of his presidency -- broke with tradition, instead preferring a Sharpie."}
{"original": "Presidents Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton all used the Cross Townsend pen, although Obama later switched to the Century II."}
{"original": "Presidents Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush were also known to use Cross pens, but the official Cross-White House program didn't begin until Clinton."}
{"original": "As for Johnson, Lawrence said he began his presidency using an old fashioned fountain pen, but he transitioned in 1965 to using a felt pen instead -- probably a less messy choice."}
{"original": "And having a good pen is important. In a diary entry dated Feb. 20, 1952, President Harry Truman wrote that he had to sign his name on letters and official documents about 600 times a day, said Randy Sowell, an archivist at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum. Across four years, well, that's a lot of signatures."}

{"original": "Why Buffett believes the rich should give their wealth away"}
{"original": "What grabs the attention of the wealthiest people in the world? Who are they? And where did all that money come from?"}
{"original": "Both the number of wealthy individuals and their collective wealth increased by about 2% last year, according to a new report from Wealth-X, a company that tracks global wealth. There were 23 million high-net-worth individuals globally in 2018, with a combined net worth of $62 trillion."}
{"original": "The majority are self-made and live in the United States, which claims 40% of the world's wealthy population."}
{"original": "Even among the rich, there are categories of wealth: There's the high-net-worth and then the ultra-high-net-worth. Wealth-X tracks high-net-worth individuals, or people who have net assets between $1 million and $30 million. The majority are clustered at the bottom, with nearly 90% of high-net-worth individuals' worth between $1 million and $5 million."}
{"original": "Ultra-high-net worth individuals are considered to be those who are worth more than $30 million."}
{"original": "What do they spend their money on?"}
{"original": "The world's richest people give a lot of their money away."}
{"original": "Philanthropic giving is one of the primary pursuits of the wealthy, particularly among the ultra wealthy, with 36% of the rich, and 57% of the super rich pointing to charitable giving as one of their top interests."}
{"original": "For most high-net-worth individuals giving is a priority. After a dip in the wake of the global financial crisis, philanthropic giving has recovered. Still, as a proportion of net worth, the wealthy give far less than people of more limited means, according to the report."}
{"original": "Last year the ultra wealthy made several high-profile mega-gifts. For example, Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos donated $2 billion to the Day One Fund to help the homeless, and Michael Bloomberg gave $1.8 billion to his alma malter, Johns Hopkins University, for financial aid."}
{"original": "For America's wealthiest, giving may be slowing due to economic concerns and the impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The legislation increased the standard deduction. This, in turn, is expected to reduce the number of tax returns itemizing deductions for charitable gifts from about 37 million before the law went into effect to about 16 million in 2018, according to the Tax Policy Center."}
{"original": "The most popular charitable causes among the wealthy last year included those supporting education, social services, arts and culture, and health."}
{"original": "But giving comes second to business among the passions, interests and hobbies of the world's wealthiest. After philanthropic giving, the wealthy are interested in finance, followed by sports and the outdoors, according to Wealth-X."}
{"original": "Looking more in depth at which sports and activities the wealthy enjoy, the overwhelming favorite is golf, followed by football, skiing, basketball and baseball. The researchers noted that these sports reflect the impact the US has over the world's high-net-worth population."}
{"original": "Interest in family, politics, animals and languages are at the bottom of the top 20."}
{"original": "Overwhelmingly, the wealthy are still men. Only 16% of high-net-worth individuals are women. Of ultra-high-net-worth individuals, only 14% are women."}
{"original": "Just over 40% of them live in North America, while a quarter live in Europe and another quarter are in Asia. The United States has the most high-net-worth individuals, followed by China, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom. The top 10 countries accounted for three quarters of the global high-net-worth population, and just under three quarters of total high-net-worth wealth in 2018."}
{"original": "New York City has the most high-net-worth people of any city in the world, although the number shrunk by about half a percent in 2018. Still, with just under a million high-net-worth individuals, New York's wealthy population is 65% larger than the city with the second most, Tokyo."}
{"original": "Hong Kong has the largest population of ultra-wealthy residents, becoming the first city to have more than 10,000 ultra wealthy individuals after overtaking New York last year."}
{"original": "But the high-net-worth population in Hong Kong dropped by more than 11% in 2018, partly as a result of markets in Hong Kong and China reacting negatively to trade uncertainty between the US and China."}
{"original": "Countries with the largest expected growth in high-net-worth individuals in the next five years include Nigeria, Egypt, Bangladesh and Vietnam."}
{"original": "How did they make their money?"}
{"original": "Only a small percentage of the world's richest people inherited all of their money. The majority are responsible for self creating some or all of their fortune, according to the report."}
{"original": "Nearly 84% of high-net-worth-individuals made their own fortunes. Only about 5% completely inherited their money and about 12% have a fortune that combines inherited and self-made wealth."}
{"original": "A higher proportion of the ultra wealthy have inherited their wealth, with about 30% receiving some or all of their fortune from inheritance, and 70% creating their own wealth."}
{"original": "The report points out that that while inequality has increased in recent decades, over the past few centuries inherited wealth has declined and the proportion of wealthy individuals whose fortunes are predominantly self-made continues to increase."}
{"original": "Among industries that the wealthy work in, finance, business and investing came first; followed by manufacturing; technology; business services; and construction."}

{"original": "Both Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and freshman New York Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez want to tax the rich – but the two progressive Democratic icons are proposing going about it in very different ways."}
{"original": "Most proposals to tax the rich have focused on raising rates on income and capital gains, as well as increasing estate taxes. That's what Ocasio-Cortez raised on CBS' 60 Minutes earlier this month, when she proposed setting rates as high as 70% on earnings above $10 million to help fund a climate change plan she describes as a Green New Deal."}
{"original": "Warren, on the other hand, wants to tap into different pool of money – the assets of the wealthy. A plan developed by her nascent presidential campaign would impose a 2% tax on Americans whose net worth exceeds $50 million, with an additional 1% levy on billionaires, according to documents provided by Warren's presidential campaign."}
{"original": "While hiking taxes on the rich is typically a go-to move for Democrats, a recent Fox News poll found that voters in both parties generally support raising rates on multimillionaires. Democrats are more enthusiastic, with 85% favoring raising taxes on those making more than $10 million. Some 54% of Republicans agree with this."}
{"original": "Ocasio-Cortez is the latest to lead the charge on boosting rates for high earners."}
{"original": "There's an element where, yeah, people are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes, she said. Once you get to the tippie-tops, on your $10 millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60% or 70%. That doesn't mean all $10 million dollars are taxed at an extremely high rate. But it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more."}
{"original": "The nation's top income tax rate was 70% in the 1970s, though the tax system was much different back then. It dropped significantly during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, then rose a bit under Democratic presidents and fell somewhat under Republican ones. Most recently, the 2017 tax bill trimmed the top rate to 37%, down from 39.6%."}
{"original": "While it may sound good to some to raise the top rate, many experts say this is not the most effective way to hike taxes on the rich since it would only hit taxable income above $10 million."}
{"original": "Just raising income tax rates on the highest-income households doesn't do as much for progressivity as some wish, Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, wrote in a blog post the day after Ocasio-Cortez' comments aired."}
{"original": "Since Ocasio-Cortez has not yet offered a detailed formal proposal, the center has not calculated how much additional revenue raising the top rate to 70% could bring in. But it's likely that high earners would try to shift their income into capital gains – by being paid in stock, deferring compensation or other methods – in order to minimize the tax hit, Gleckman said."}
{"original": "Warren, meanwhile, is suggesting taxing accumulated wealth, not annual income."}
{"original": "University of California Berkeley economics professors Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, who analyzed the proposal for the Warren team, estimate that 75,000 households – less than the wealthiest 0.1% – would be subject to this tax. The plan would raise around $2.75 trillion over 10 years."}
{"original": "Experts are divided over how well a wealth tax would work and whether it is permitted by the US Constitution, which limits Congress' power to levy so-called direct taxes. Several scholars, including multiple former heads of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, have written to the Warren campaign defending the plan's legality."}
{"original": "Supporters of Warren's proposal say it would enable the government to tax the vast assets of the wealthy, including closely-held businesses, mansions, artwork and financial holdings. Currently, these are typically only taxed when they are sold – and even then, they are subject to a lower capital gains rate."}
{"original": "Simply raising a tax rate on an existing base is not going to do very much, said David Kamin, a law professor at New York University and former special assistant for economic poilcy in the Obama administration. Warren's proposal is more effectively taxing people who are not captured to a significant degree in our current income tax, who have built up large fortunes and simply aren't paying very much tax relative to those fortunes."}
{"original": "But wealth taxes can be difficult to administer since the rich have assets that are hard to value."}
{"original": "Imagine a large privately-held company—its value could change almost daily. How would the tax handle these fluctuations? wrote right-leaning Tax Foundation analysts Nicole Kaeding and Kyle Pomerleau in a post. They noted that several countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development have dropped their wealth taxes because of the challenges posed by collection."}
{"original": "The wealth tax gives the IRS a chance to tighten its existing rules for valuing assets to close loopholes and to develop new valuation rules, Warren's campaign says in a summary of her proposed tax. To limit people's ability to evade the tax, she would provide a significant increase in the agency's enforcement budget and set a minimum audit rate for taxpayers in this asset category, among other measures."}
{"original": "Both Warren and Ocasio-Cortez have made clear they're open to each others' ideas. Spokespeople for both lawmakers said they support both types of tax hikes on the wealthy since both would minimize income inequality."}
{"original": "If you really want to go after concentrated wealth, you have to tax wealth itself, according to a Warren campaign aide. This is not to say you can't change income taxes, and I think [Warren] would be supportive of that. But this is really the way to get at the dramatic inequality and concentration of wealth that we have in America."}
{"original": "This is not an either/or question, said Corbin Trent, communications director for Ocasio-Cortez. This is a question about how we reform our entire tax policy in this country to address two of the biggest challenges that we faced as a nation over the past thirty years, which are income and wealth inequality."}

{"original": "And as I think back on those years and the work that I've done ever since, you know, for me politics is about making real differences in people's lives. I am very, very proud that over these years I have been able to make a difference in the lives of people in Texas, Ohio and elsewhere."}

{"original": "So there's a lot that we've already done. But there's so much more to do."}
{"original": "I want to take on the tough issues that face us now. I want to stop the health insurance companies from discriminating against people because they're sick. You know, it's unconstitutional to discriminate on the basis of race or gender or ethnic origin or religion, but it's OK to discriminate against sick people."}
{"original": "And we're going to end that, because it's time we said no more."}
{"original": "And I want to continue the work that I've done in the Senate to take care of our veterans."}
{"original": "CLINTON: It was shocking and shameful, what happened, that we discovered about a year ago at Walter Reed. We can do so much better, to take care of the people who've taken care of us."}
{"original": "And there is a lot of work ahead. I offer a lifetime of experience and proven results. And I know that, if we work together, we can take on the special interests, transfer $55 billion of all those giveaways and subsidies that President Bush has given them, back to the middle class, to create jobs and provide health care and make college affordable."}
{"original": "And I ask you -- I ask you to join in my campaign. It's now up to the people of Texas, Ohio, and the other states ahead."}

{"original": "... Senator Clinton and I have been talking about these issues for the last 13 months. We both offer detailed proposals to try to deal with them. Some of them are the same. Some we have differences of opinion."}
{"original": "But I think we both recognize that these problems have to be dealt with and that we have seen an administration over the last seven years that has failed to address them and -- in many ways -- has made them worse."}

{"original": "OBAMA: The problem we have is that Washington has become a place where good ideas go to die. They go to die because the lobbyists..."}
{"original": "They go to die because lobbyists and special interests have a strangle-hold on the agenda in Washington. They go to die in Washington because too many politicians are interested in scoring political points rather than bridging differences in order to get things done."}

{"original": "Thank you so much for being with us, and let me start with a little news. After nearly half a century in office, Fidel Castro resigned as the head of the Cuban government. Ninety miles off the coast of the United States, we might have a new opportunity."}
{"original": "The question for you, Senator Clinton: Would you be willing to sit down with Raul Castro, or whoever leads the Cuban dictatorship when you take office at least just once, to get a measure of the man?"}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, Jorge, I hope we have an opportunity. The people of Cuba deserve to have a democracy. And this gives the Cuban government, under Raul Castro, a chance to change direction from the one that was set for 50 years by his brother."}
{"original": "I'm going to be looking for some of those changes: releasing political prisoner, ending some of the oppressive practices on the press, opening up the economy."}
{"original": "Of course the United States stands ready. And, as president, I would be ready to reach out and work with a new Cuban government, once it demonstrated that it truly was going to change that direction."}
{"original": "I want to bring the region together, our European allies who have influence with Cuba, to try to push for some of those changes, and to make it very clear that, if Cuba moves toward democracy and freedom for its people, the United States will welcome that."}
{"original": "CLINTON: And as president, I would look for opportunities to try to make that happen and to create the momentum that might eventually lead to a presidential visit."}
{"original": "But there has to be evidence that indeed the changes are real; that they are taking place; and that the Cuban people will finally be given an opportunity to have their future determined by themselves."}
{"original": "RAMOS: Very simply, would you meet with him or not, with Raul Castro?"}
{"original": "CLINTON: I would not meet with him until there was evidence that change was happening, because I think it's important that they demonstrate clearly that they are committed to change the direction. Then I think, you know, something like diplomatic encounters and negotiations over specifics could take place."}
{"original": "But we've had this conversation before, Senator Obama and myself, and I believe that we should have full diplomatic engagement where appropriate. But a presidential visit should not be offered and given without some evidence that it will demonstrate the kind of progress that is in our interest, and in this case, in the interests of the Cuban people."}
{"original": "BROWN: Senator Obama, just to follow up, you had said in a previous CNN debate that you would meet with the leaders of Cuban, Iran, North Korea, among others, so presumably you would be willing to meet with the new leader of Cuba."}
{"original": "OBAMA: That's correct. Now, keep in mind that the starting point for our policy in Cuba should be the liberty of the Cuban people. And I think we recognize that that liberty has not existed throughout the Castro regime. And we now have an opportunity to potentially change the relationship between the United States and Cuba after over half a century."}
{"original": "I would meet without preconditions, although Senator Clinton is right that there has to be preparation. It is very important for us to make sure that there was an agenda, and on that agenda was human rights, releasing of political prisoners, opening up the press. And that preparation might take some time."}
{"original": "But I do think that it's important for the United States not just to talk to its friends, but also to talk to its enemies. In fact, that's where diplomacy makes the biggest difference."}
{"original": "OBAMA: One other thing that I've said, as a show of good faith that we're interested in pursuing potentially a new relationship, what I've called for is a loosening of the restrictions on remittances from family members to the people of Cuba, as well as travel restrictions for family members who want to visit their family members in Cuba."}
{"original": "And I think that initiating that change in policy as a start and then suggesting that an agenda get set up is something that could be useful, but I would not normalize relations until we started seeing some of the progress that Senator Clinton was talking about."}
{"original": "BROWN: But that's different from your position back in 2003. You called U.S. policy toward Cuba a miserable failure, and you supported normalizing relations."}
{"original": "OBAMA: I support the eventual normalization. And it's absolutely true that I think our policy has been a failure. I mean, the fact is, is that during my entire lifetime, and Senator Clinton's entire lifetime, you essentially have seen a Cuba that has been isolated, but has not made progress when it comes to the issues of political rights and personal freedoms that are so important to the people of Cuba."}
{"original": "So I think that we have to shift policy. I think our goal has to be ultimately normalization. But that's going to happen in steps. And the first step, as I said, is changing our rules with respect to remittances and with respect to travel."}
{"original": "And then I think it is important for us to have the direct contact, not just in Cuba, but I think this principle applies generally. I recall what John F. Kennedy once said, that we should never negotiate out of fear, but we should never fear to negotiate. And this moment, this opportunity when Fidel Castro has finally stepped down, I think, is one that we should try to take advantage of."}
{"original": "BROWN: Senator Clinton, do you want a quick response?"}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, I agree, absolutely, that we should be willing to have diplomatic negotiations and processes with anyone. I've been a strong advocate of opening up such a diplomatic process with Iran, for a number of years."}
{"original": "Because I think we should look for ways that we can possibly move countries that are adversarial to us, you know, toward the world community. It's in our interests. It's in the interests of the people in countries that, frankly, are oppressed, like Cuba, like Iran."}
{"original": "But there has been this difference between us over when and whether the president should offer a meeting, without preconditions, with those with whom we do not have diplomatic relations. And it should be part of a process, but I don't think it should be offered in the beginning. Because I think that undermines the capacity for us to actually take the measure of somebody like Raul Castro or Ahmadinejad and others."}
{"original": "CLINTON: And, as President Kennedy said, he wouldn't be afraid to negotiate, but he would expect there to be a lot of preparatory work done, to find out exactly what we would get out of it."}
{"original": "And therefore, I do think we should be eliminating the policy of the Bush administration, which has been very narrowly defined, and frankly against our interests, because we have failed to reach out to countries, we have alienated our friends, and we have emboldened our enemies."}
{"original": "So I would get back to very vigorous diplomacy, and I would use bipartisan diplomacy. I would ask emissaries from both political parties to represent me and our country, because I want to send a very clear message to the rest of the world that the era of unilateralism, preemption and arrogance of the Bush administration is over and we're going to..."}
{"original": "BROWN: Very briefly and then we're going to move on."}
{"original": "OBAMA: I think, as I said before, preparation is actually absolutely critical in any meeting. And I think it is absolutely true that either of us would step back from some of the Bush unilateralism that's caused so much damage."}
{"original": "But I do think it is important precisely because the Bush administration has done so much damage to American foreign relations that the president take a more active role in diplomacy than might have been true 20 or 30 years ago."}
{"original": "Because the problem is, if we think that meeting with the president is a privilege that has to be earned, I think that reinforces the sense that we stand above the rest of the world at this point in time. And I think that it's important for us in undoing the damage that has been done over the last seven years, for the president to be willing to take that extra step."}
{"original": "OBAMA: That is the kind of step that I would like to take as president of the United States."}
{"original": "BROWN: A question now on the economy."}
{"original": "CNN's JOHN KING: Campbell, Senators, good evening, first."}
{"original": "I want to bring the conversation back home. You know from your travels -- you don't need to look at the polls or anything else -- that the economy is by far now the dominant issue that voters want to hear about from the candidates."}
{"original": "For some, that is a question about: What should we do about an economy that is at the edge or perhaps in the early stages of a recession? For some, it is more focused. Maybe it is: Will you raise the minimum wage? Maybe it's about trade deals that they think leave them on the raw end, as you mentioned in your opening statement, Senator Obama."}
{"original": "But when we ask Democrats, How are these two candidates different?, they even think they don't know."}
{"original": "Senator Obama, beginning with you, tell us as specifically as you can, how would a President Obama be different than a President Clinton in managing the nation's economy?"}
{"original": "OBAMA: Well, first of all, let me emphasize the point that you just made, which is: You don't need an economist or the Federal Reserve to tell the American people that the economy's in trouble, because they've been experiencing it for years now."}
{"original": "Everywhere you go, you meet people who are working harder for less, wages and incomes have flatlined, people are seeing escalating costs of everything from health care to gas at the pump."}
{"original": "And so people have been struggling for a long time. In some communities, they have been struggling for decades now. So this has to be a priority of the next president."}
{"original": "Now, what I've said is that we have to restore a sense of fairness and balance to our economy, and that means a couple of things."}
{"original": "Number one, with our tax code: We've got to stop giving tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas and invest those tax breaks in companies that are investing here in the United States of America."}
{"original": "We have to end the Bush tax cuts to the wealthy..."}
{"original": "... and to provide tax breaks to middle-class Americans and working Americans who need them."}
{"original": "OBAMA: So I've said that if you are making $75,000 a year or less, I want to give an offset to your payroll tax that will mean $1,000 extra in the pockets of ordinary Americans. Senior citizens making less than $50,000, you shouldn't have to pay income tax on your Social Security."}
{"original": "We pay for these by closing tax loopholes and tax havens that are being manipulated."}
{"original": "On our trade deals, I think it is absolutely critical that we engaged in trade, but it has to be viewed not just through the lens of Wall Street, but also Main Street, which means we've got strong labor standards and strong environmental standards and safety standards, so we don't have toys being shipped in the United States with lead paint on them."}
{"original": "So these are all issues that I've talked about repeatedly, and I think there are also opportunities in our economy around creating a green economy. We send $1 billion to foreign countries every day because of our addiction to foreign oil."}
{"original": "OBAMA: And for us to move rapidly to cap greenhouse gases, generate billions of dollars that we can reinvest in solar and wind and biodiesel -- that can put people back to work. So..."}
{"original": "Now, I don't want to take too much time. And I'm sure we'll be spend more time discussing this."}
{"original": "Senator Clinton and I, I think, both agree on many of these issues. And I think it's a credit to the Democratic Party as a whole that the other candidates who were involved earlier on agreed with us on many of these issues."}
{"original": "I think that there is a real, solid agenda for moving change forward in the next presidency."}
{"original": "The question people are going to have to ask is: How do we get it done?"}
{"original": "And it is my strong belief that the changes are only going to come about if we're able to form a working coalition for change. Because people who were benefiting from the current tax code are going to resist. The special interests and lobbyists are going to resist."}
{"original": "And I think it has to be a priority for whoever the next president is to be able to overcome the dominance of the special interests in Washington, to bring about the kinds of economic changes that I'm talking about."}
{"original": "OBAMA: And that's an area where Senator Clinton and I may have a slight difference. But I'm happy to let her speak first and then can pick up on anything that's been left out."}
{"original": "KING: Let's give Senator Clinton that opportunity then."}
{"original": "As you have campaigned, Senator, on this issue and others, but specifically on this issue, you have said, I am ready on day one to take charge of the economy."}
{"original": "The clear implication, since you have one opponent at the moment, is that you're ready; he's not."}
{"original": "What would you do differently on day one than a President Obama would when it comes to managing the nation's economy?"}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, I would agree with a lot that Senator Obama just said, because it is the Democratic agenda."}
{"original": "CLINTON: We are going to rid the tax code of these loopholes and giveaways."}
{"original": "We're going to stop giving a penny of your money to anybody who ships a job out of Texas, Ohio or anywhere else to another country."}
{"original": "We're certainly going to begin to get the tax code to reflect what the needs of middle class families are so we can rebuild a strong and prosperous middle class."}
{"original": "You know, the wealthy and the well-connected have had a president the last seven years, and I think it's time that the rest of America had a president to work for you every single day."}
{"original": "We will also have a different approach toward trade."}
{"original": "We're going to start having trade agreements that not only have strong environmental and labor standards, but I want to have a trade time-out. We're going to look and see what's working and what's not working, and I'd like to have a trade prosecutor to actually enforce the trade agreements that we have before we enter into any others."}
{"original": "We're also going to put much tougher standards in place so that people cannot import toys with lead paint, contaminated pet food, contaminated drugs into our market. We're going to have much more vigorous enforcement of safety standards."}
{"original": "CLINTON: Now, in addition, there are steps I would take immediately. One is on this foreclosure crisis. I have been saying for nearly a year we had to crack down on the abusive practices of the lenders. But we also need a moratorium on home foreclosures."}
{"original": "Everywhere I go, I meet people who either have been or about to lose their home. 85,000 homes in foreclosure in Texas; 90,000 in Ohio. I've met the families: the hairdresser, the single mom who's going to lose her home, the postal worker who got really hoodwinked into an agreement that wasn't fair to him."}
{"original": "So I would put a moratorium for 90 days, to give us time to work out a way for people to stay in their homes, and I would freeze interest rates for five years. Because these adjustable-rate mortgages, if they keep going up, millions of Americans are going to be homeless. And vacant homes will be across the neighborhoods of Texas and America."}
{"original": "CLINTON: Now, in addition, there are three ways we need to jump start the economy."}
{"original": "Clean green jobs; I've been promoting this. I wanted it to be part of the stimulus package. I thought a $5 billion investment in clean green jobs would put hundreds of thousands of Americans to work helping to create our future."}
{"original": "We also need to invest in our infrastructure. We don't have enough roads to take care of the congestion, we have crumbling bridges and tunnels. We need to rebuild America, and that will also put people to work."}
{"original": "And, finally, we need to end George Bush's war on science, which has been waged against scientists and researchers..."}
{"original": "BROWN: Thank you, Senator. And we've got a lot of ground to cover..."}
{"original": "CLINTON: This is about how we fund the future. We've got to get back to being the innovation nation. Think of everything that goes on at this great university to create the new economy..."}
{"original": "BROWN: All right. Senator Clinton, thank you very much."}
{"original": "BROWN: And, as I was saying, we've got a lot to get through. So I do want to shift gears and go on to another topic especially important here in Texas, which is immigration."}
{"original": "And, Jorge, you have a question."}
{"original": "RAMOS: (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Federal raids by immigration enforcement officials on homes and businesses have generated a great deal of fear and anxiety in the Hispanic community and have divided the family of some of the 3 million U.S.-born children who have at least one undocumented parent."}
{"original": "Would you consider stopping these raids once you take office until comprehensive immigration reform can be passed?"}
{"original": "CLINTON: I would consider that, except in egregious situations where it would be appropriate to take the actions you're referring to."}
{"original": "But when we see what's been happening, with literally babies being left with no one to take care of them, children coming home from school, no responsible adult left, that is not the America that I know."}
{"original": "CLINTON: That is against American values. And it is..."}
{"original": "And it is a stark admission of failure by the federal government. We need comprehensive immigration reform. I have been for this. I signed onto the first comprehensive bill back in 2004. I've been advocating for it: tougher, more secure borders, of course, but let's do it the right way, cracking down on employers, especially once we get to comprehensive immigration reform, who exploit undocumented workers and drive down wages for everyone else."}
{"original": "I'd like to see more federal help for communities like Austin and others like Laredo, where I was this morning, that absorb the health care, education, and law enforcement costs."}
{"original": "And I personally, as president, would work with our neighbors to the south, to help them create more jobs for their own people."}
{"original": "Finally, we need a path to legalization, to bring the immigrants out of the shadows, give them the conditions that we expect them to meet, paying a fine for coming here illegally, trying to pay back taxes, over time, and learning English."}
{"original": "If they had a committed a crime in our country or the country they came from, then they should be deported. But for everyone else, there must be a path to legalization. I would introduce that in the first 100 days of my presidency."}
{"original": "BROWN: Senator Obama, is your position the same as Hillary Clinton's?"}
{"original": "OBAMA: There are a couple of things I would add. Comprehensive immigration reform is something that I have worked on extensively."}
{"original": "Two years ago, we were able to get a bill out of the Senate. I was one of the group of senators that helped to move it through, but it died in the House this year. Because it was used as a political football instead of a way of solving a problem, nothing happened."}
{"original": "And so there are a couple of things that I would just add to what Senator Clinton said."}
{"original": "Number one, it is absolutely critical that we tone down the rhetoric when it comes to the immigration debate, because there has been an undertone that has been ugly."}
{"original": "Oftentimes, it has been directed at the Hispanic community. We have seen hate crimes skyrocket in the wake of the immigration debate as it has been conducted in Washington, and that is unacceptable."}
{"original": "We are a nation of laws and we are a nation of immigrants, and we can reconcile those two things. So we need comprehensive reform..."}
{"original": "... we need comprehensive reform, and that means stronger border security. It means that we are cracking down on employers that are taking advantage of undocumented workers because they can't complain if they're not paid a minimum wage."}
{"original": "OBAMA: They can't complain if they're not getting overtime. Worker safety laws are not being observed."}
{"original": "We have to crack down on those employers, although we also have to make sure that we do it in a way that doesn't lead to people with Spanish surnames being discriminated against, so there's got to be a safeguard there."}
{"original": "We have to require that undocumented workers, who are provided a pathway to citizenship, not only learn English, pay back taxes and pay a significant fine, but also that they're going to the back of the line, so that they are not getting citizenship before those who have applied legally, which raises two last points."}
{"original": "Number one, it is important that we fix the legal immigration system, because right now we've got a backlog that means years for people to apply legally."}
{"original": "And what's worse is, we keep on increasing the fees, so that if you've got a hard working immigrant family, they've got to hire a lawyer; they've got to pay thousands of dollars in fees. They just can't afford it. And it's discriminatory against people who have good character, we should want in this country, but don't have the money. So we've got to fix that."}
{"original": "OBAMA: So we've got to fix that."}
{"original": "The second thing is, we have to improve our relationship with Mexico and work with the Mexican government so that their economy is producing jobs on that side of the border."}
{"original": "And the problem that we have..."}
{"original": "The problem that we have is that we have had an administration that came in promising all sorts of leadership on creating a U.S.- Mexican relationship. And, frankly, President Bush dropped the ball. He has been so obsessed with Iraq that we have not seen the kinds of outreach and cooperative work that would ensure that the Mexican economy is working not just for the very wealthy in Mexico, but for all people. And that's as policy that I'm going to change when I'm president of the United States."}
{"original": "We're going to stay with this topic. I want to have John King ask another question."}
{"original": "KING: I want to stay on the issue, but move to a controversial item that was not held up when the immigration debate collapsed in Washington, and that is the border fence."}
{"original": "KING: To many Americans, it is a simple question of sovereignty and security. America should be able to keep people out that it doesn't want in."}
{"original": "But, as you know in this state, especially if you go to the south of here, along the border, and in other border states, to many people it's a much more personal question. It could be a question of their livelihood. It could be a question of cross-border trade. It might be an issue to a rancher of property rights. It might be a simple question of whether someone can take a walk or a short drive to see their family members."}
{"original": "Senator, back in 2006, you voted for the construction of that fence. As you know, progress has been slow."}
{"original": "As president of the United States, would you commit tonight that you would finish the fence and speed up the construction, or do you think it's time for a president of the United States to raise his or her hand and say, You know what? Wait a minute. Let's think about this again. Do we really want to do this?"}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, I think both Senator Obama and I voted for that as part of the immigration debate."}
{"original": "CLINTON: And having been along the border for the last week or so -- in fact, last night I was at the University of Texas at Brownsville -- and this is how absurd this has become under the Bush administration. Because, you know, there is a smart way to protect our borders, and there is a dumb way to protect our borders."}
{"original": "And what I learned last night when I was there with Congressman Ortiz is that the University of Texas at Brownsville would have part of its campus cut off."}
{"original": "This is the kind of absurdity that we're getting from this administration. I know it because I've been fighting with them about the northern border. Their imposition of passports and other kinds of burdens are separating people from families, interfering with business and commerce, the movement of goods and people."}
{"original": "So what I've said is that I would say, wait a minute, we need to review this. There may be places where a physical barrier is appropriate."}
{"original": "I think when both of us voted for this, we were voting for the possibility that where it was appropriate and made sense, it would be considered. But as with so much, the Bush administration has gone off the deep end, and they are unfortunately coming up with a plan that I think is counterproductive."}
{"original": "CLINTON: So I would have a review. I would listen to the people who live along the border, who understand..."}
{"original": "... what it is we need to be doing to protect our country."}
{"original": "BROWN: Let me go on, again -- John?"}
{"original": "KING: Does that mean that you think your vote was wrong, or the implementation of it was wrong?"}
{"original": "Because, as you know, when they first built the fence in the San Diego area, it only went so far. And what it did was it sopped the people coming straight up the path of where that was built, and they simply moved. And California's problem became Arizona's problem."}
{"original": "CLINTON: But, you know, John, there is -- there's a lot we've learned about technology and smart fencing. You know, there is technology that can be used instead of a physical barrier."}
{"original": "CLINTON: It requires us having enough personnel along the border so that people can be supervising a certain limited amount of space and will be able to be responsive in the event of people attempting to cross illegally."}
{"original": "I think that the way that the Bush administration is going about this, filing eminent domain actions against landowners and municipalities, makes no sense."}
{"original": "So what I have said is, yes, there are places when after a careful review, again listening to the people who live along the border, there may be limited places where it would work. But let's deploy more technology and personnel, instead of the physical barrier."}
{"original": "I frankly think that will work better and it will give us an opportunity to secure our borders without interfering with family relations, business relations, recreation and so much else that makes living along the border, you know, wonderful."}
{"original": "CLINTON: And the people who live there need to have a president who understands it, will listen to them and be responsive."}
{"original": "OBAMA: Well, this is an area where Senator Clinton and I almost entirely agree. I think that the key is to consult with local communities, whether it's on the commercial interests or the environmental stakes of creating any kind of barrier."}
{"original": "And the Bush administration is not real good at listening. That's not what they do well."}
{"original": "And so I will reverse that policy. As Senator Clinton indicated, there may be areas where it makes sense to have some fencing. But for the most part, having border patrolled, surveillance, deploying effective technology, that's going to be the better approach."}
{"original": "The one thing I do have to say, though, about this issue is, it is very important for us, I think, to deal with this problem in terms of thousands of -- hundreds of thousands of people coming over the borders on a regular basis if we want to also provide opportunity for the 12 million undocumented workers who are here."}
{"original": "OBAMA: Senator Clinton and I have both campaigned in places like Iowa and Ohio and my home state of Illinois, and I think that the American people want fairness, want justice. I think they recognize that the idea that you're going to deport 12 million people is ridiculous, that we're not going to be devoting all our law enforcement resources..."}
{"original": "But what they do also want is some order to the process. And so, we're not going to be able to do these things in isolation. We're not going to be able to deal with the 12 million people who are living in the shadows and give them a way of getting out of the shadows if we don't also deal with the problem of this constant influx of undocumented workers."}
{"original": "And that's why I think comprehensive reform is so important. That's the kind of leadership that I've shown in the past; that's the kind of leadership that I'll show in the future."}
{"original": "One last point I want to make on the immigration issue because we may be moving to different topics: Something that we can do immediately that I think is very important is to pass the Dream Act, which allows children who through no fault of their own are here but have essentially grown up as Americans, allow them the opportunity for higher education."}
{"original": "OBAMA: I do not want two classes of citizens in this country."}
{"original": "I want everybody to prosper. That's going to be a top priority."}
{"original": "BROWN: OK, we've got one last question on immigration."}
{"original": "RAMOS: (SPEAKING SPANISH) Right now, there are more than 30 million people in this country who speak Spanish."}
{"original": "Many of them are right here. By the year 2050, there will be 120 million Hispanics in the United States. Now, is there any downside, Senator Clinton, to the United States becoming (SPEAKING SPANISH) becoming a bilingual nation? Is there a limit?"}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, I think it's important for as many Americans as possible to do what I have never been able to do, and that is learn another language and try to be bilingual because that connects us to the rest of the world."}
{"original": "I think it is important, though, that English remain our common unifying language because that brings our country together in a way that we have seen generations of immigrants coming to our shores be able to be part of the American experience and pursue the American dream."}
{"original": "You know, I have been adamantly against the efforts by some to make English the official language. That I do not believe is appropriate, and I have voted against it and spoken against it."}
{"original": "CLINTON: I represent New York. We have 170 languages in New York City alone. And I do not think that we should be, in any way, discriminating against people who do not speak English, who use facilities like hospitals or have to go to court to enforce their rights."}
{"original": "But I do think that English does remain an important part of the American experience. So I encourage people to become bilingual. But I also want to see English remain the common, unifying language of our country."}
{"original": "RAMOS: Senator Obama, is there any down side to the United States becoming a bilingual nation?"}
{"original": "OBAMA: Well, I think it is important that everyone learns English and that we have that process of binding ourselves together as a country. I think that's very important."}
{"original": "I also think that every student should be learning a second language, because..."}
{"original": "... you know, so, when you start getting into a debate about bilingual education, for example, now, I want to make sure that children who are coming out of Spanish-speaking households had the opportunity to learn and are not falling behind."}
{"original": "OBAMA: If bilingual education helps them do that, I want to give them the opportunity."}
{"original": "But I also want to make sure that English-speaking children are getting foreign languages because this world is becoming more interdependent and part of the process of America's continued leadership in the world is going to be our capacity to communicate across boundaries, across borders, and that's something frankly where we've fallen behind."}
{"original": "One of the failures of No Child Left Behind, a law that I think a lot of local and state officials have been troubled by, is that it is so narrowly focused on standardized tests that it has pushed out a lot of important learning that needs to take place."}
{"original": "And foreign languages is one of those areas that I think has been neglected. I want to put more resources into it."}
{"original": "We're going to take a quick break. We've got to go to a commercial. We'll be back with a lot more. There is also a debate we should mention raging online right now. Go to our Web site, CNNpolitics.com, and join in. The debate here at the University of Texas in Austin continues right after this."}
{"original": "BROWN: And we are back. We're here in Austin, Texas, the capital city. Welcome back to the Texas Democratic debate at the University of Texas, Austin."}
{"original": "The first question now goes to John King."}
{"original": "KING: Senator, as I'm sitting here, we're about 45 minutes into the discussion tonight, and I'm having what I like to call one of those parallel universe moments."}
{"original": "I've been watching each of you give speeches in arenas not unlike this one individually. And the tone is often quite different than the very polite, substantive discourse we've had tonight."}
{"original": "And so, I want to ask you about that. There are times when each of you seems to call into question the other one's credibility or truthfulness."}
{"original": "And, Senator Clinton, I want to talk specifically about some words you've spoken here in the state of Texas over the past couple of days."}
{"original": "You've said, quote, My opponent gives speeches; I offer solutions."}
{"original": "You said the choice for Democrats in this campaign is, quote, talk versus action."}
{"original": "Now, in a campaign that some of us are old enough to remember, maybe not many of the students here, this would be called the Where's the beef? question."}
{"original": "But, since we're in Texas, I'd like to borrow a phrase that they often use here and you've used yourself in the context of President Bush. Are you saying that your opponent is all hat and no cattle, and can you say that after the last 45 minutes?"}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, I have said that about President Bush, and I think our next president needs to be a lot less hat and a lot more cattle."}
{"original": "You know, I think you can tell from the first 45 minutes, you know, Senator Obama and I have a lot in common. We both care passionately about our country. We are devoted to public service. We care deeply about the future, and we have run a very vigorous and contested primary campaign, which has been by most standards, I think, very positive and extremely civil."}
{"original": "CLINTON: But there are differences between us. And I think, in our efforts to draw those contrasts and comparisons, we obviously try to let voters know how we see the world differently."}
{"original": "And I do offer solutions. That's what I believe in and what I have done. And it's what I offer to voters because it's part of my life, over the last 35 years, working to get kids health care, working to expand legal services for the poor, working to register voters, working to make a difference. Because I think that this country has given me so much."}
{"original": "And there are differences between our records and our accomplishments. I have to confess, I was somewhat amused, the other night, when, on one of the TV shows, one of Senator Obama's supporters couldn't."}
{"original": "So I know that there are comparisons and contrasts to be drawn between us. And it's important that voters get that information. So, yes, I do think that words are important and words matter, but actions speak louder than words. And I offer..."}
{"original": "BROWN: Senator Obama, do you want to respond?"}
{"original": "OBAMA: Well, I think actions do speak louder than words, which is why over the 20 years of my public service I have acted a lot to provide health care to people who didn't have it, to provide tax breaks to families that needed it, to reform a criminal justice system that had resulted in wrongful convictions, to open up our government and to pass the toughest ethics reform legislation since Watergate, to make sure that we create transparency..."}
{"original": "... to make sure that we create transparency in our government so that we know where federal spending is going and it's not going to a bunch of boondoggles and earmarks that are wasting taxpayer money that could be spent on things like early childhood education."}
{"original": "You know, I think if you talk to those wounded warriors at Walter Reed who, prior to me getting to the Senate, were having to pay for their meals and have to pay for their phone calls to their family while they're recovering from amputations, I think they've said that I've engaged not just in talk, but in action."}
{"original": "OBAMA: Now, I think that Senator Clinton has a fine record and I don't want to denigrate that record. I do think there is a fundamental difference between us in terms of how change comes about. Senator Clinton of late has said: Let's get real. The implication is that the people who've been voting for me or involved in my campaign are somehow delusional."}
{"original": "And that, you know, the 20 million people who've been paying attention to 19 debates and the editorial boards all across the country at newspapers who have given me endorsements, including every major newspaper here in the state of Texas."}
{"original": "OBAMA: You know, the thinking is that somehow, they're being duped, and eventually they're going to see the reality of things."}
{"original": "Well, I think they perceive reality of what's going on in Washington very clearly. What they see is that if we don't bring the country together, stop the endless bickering, actually focus on solutions and reduce the special interests that have dominated Washington, then we will not get anything done. And the reason that this campaign has done so well..."}
{"original": "The reason that this campaign has done so well is because people understand that it is not just a matter of putting forward policy positions."}
{"original": "OBAMA: Senator Clinton and I share a lot of policy positions. But if we can't inspire the American people to get involved in their government and if we can't inspire them to go beyond the racial divisions and the religious divisions and the regional divisions that have plagued our politics for so long, then we will continue to see the kind of gridlock and nonperformance in Washington that is resulting in families suffering in very real ways."}
{"original": "I'm running for president to start doing something about that suffering, and so are the people who are behind my campaign."}
{"original": "BROWN: I think one of the points -- I think one of the points that John King was alluding to in talking about some of Senator Clinton's comments is there has been a lot of attention lately on some of your speeches, that they are very similar to some of the speeches by your friend and supporter Deval Patrick, the governor of Massachusetts, and Senator Clinton's campaign has made a big issue of this. To be blunt, they've accused you of plagiarism."}
{"original": "OBAMA: Well, look, the -- first of all, it's not a lot of speeches. There are two lines in speeches that I've been giving over the last couple of weeks."}
{"original": "I've been campaigning now for the last two years. Deval is a national co-chairman of my campaign, and suggested an argument that I share, that words are important. Words matter. And the implication that they don't I think diminishes how important it is to speak to the American people directly about making America as good as its promise. Barbara Jordan understood this as well as anybody."}
{"original": "OBAMA: And the notion that I had plagiarized from somebody who was one of my national co-chairs..."}
{"original": "... who gave me the line and suggested that I use it, I think, is silly, and..."}
{"original": "... you know, this is where we start getting into silly season, in politics, and I think people start getting discouraged about it..."}
{"original": "What they want is, how are we going to create good jobs and good wages?"}
{"original": "How are we going to provide health care to the American people?"}
{"original": "How are we going to make sure that college is affordable?"}
{"original": "So what I've been talking about, in this speeches -- and I've got to admit, some of them are pretty good."}
{"original": "What I've been talking about is not just hope and not just inspiration. It's a $4,000 tuition credit for every student, every year, in exchange for national service..."}
{"original": "... so that college becomes more affordable."}
{"original": "OBAMA: I've been talking about making sure that we change our tax code so that working families actually get relief. I have been talking about making sure that we bring an end to this war in Iraq so that we can start bringing our troops home and invest money here in the United States."}
{"original": "So just to finish up, these are very specific, concrete, detailed proposals, many of them which I have been working on for years now. Senator Clinton has a fine record. So do I. I'm happy to have a debate on the issues, but what we shouldn't be spending time doing is tearing each other down. We should be spending time lifting the country up."}
{"original": "BROWN: Senator Clinton, is it the silly season?"}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, I think that if your candidacy is going to be about words, then they should be your own words. That's, I think, a very simple proposition."}
{"original": "And, you know, lifting whole passages from someone else's speeches is not change you can believe in, it's change you can Xerox. And I just don't think..."}
{"original": "CLINTON: No, but, you know, but, Barack, it is."}
{"original": "Because, you know, if you look -- if you look -- if you look at the YouTube of these videos, it does raise questions."}
{"original": "Now, there is no doubt that you are a passionate, eloquent speaker, and I applaud you for that. But when you look at what we face in this country, we do need to unite the country, but we have to unite it for a purpose around very specific goals."}
{"original": "CLINTON: It is not enough to say, Let's come together. We know we're going to have to work hard to overcome the opposition of those who do not want the changes to get to universal health care."}
{"original": "You know, when I proposed a universal health care plan, as did Senator Edwards, we took a big risk, because we know it's politically controversial to say we're going to cover everyone."}
{"original": "And you chose not to do that. You chose to put forth a health care plan that will leave out at least 15 million people. That's a big difference."}
{"original": "When I said we should put a moratorium on home foreclosures, basically your response was, well, that wouldn't work."}
{"original": "And, you know, in the last week, even President Bush has said we have to do something like that."}
{"original": "I just believe that we've got to look hard at the difficult challenges we face, especially after George Bush leaves the White House."}
{"original": "CLINTON: The world will breathe a sigh of relief once he is gone. We all know that."}
{"original": "But then we've got to do the hard work of not just bringing the country together, but overcoming a lot of the entrenched opposition to the very ideas that both of us believe in, and for some of us have been fighting for, for a very long time. You know, when I took on..."}
{"original": "When I took on universal health care back in '93 and '94, it was against a firestorm of special interest opposition. I was more than happy to do that, because I believe passionately in getting quality affordable health care to every American."}
{"original": "I don't want to leave anybody out. I see the results of leaving people out. I am tired of health insurance companies deciding who will live or die in America."}
{"original": "BROWN: All right, Senator Clinton, thank you."}
{"original": "OBAMA: Well, I think that Senator Clinton mentioned two specific issue areas where we've got some differences. I'm happy to debate those, which is what I think should be the focus of this campaign. We both want universal health care."}
{"original": "When I released my plan a few months later, we were in a debate and Senator Clinton said we all want universal health care. Of course, I was down 20 points in the polls at the time, and so my plan was pretty good. It's not as good now, but my plan hasn't changed. The politics have changed a little bit."}
{"original": "We both -- 95 percent of our plans are similar. We both want to set up a system in which any person is going to be able to get coverage that is as good as we have as members of Congress. And we are going to subsidize those who can't afford it."}
{"original": "OBAMA: We're going to make sure that we reduce costs by emphasizing prevention. And I want to make sure that we're applying technology to improve quality, cut bureaucracy."}
{"original": "Now, I also want to make sure that we're reducing costs for those who already have health insurance. So we put in place a catastrophic reinsurance plan that would reduce costs by $2,500 per family per year."}
{"original": "So we've got a lot of similarities in our plan. We've got a philosophical difference, which we've debated repeatedly, and that is that Senator Clinton believes the only way to achieve universal health care is to force everybody to purchase it."}
{"original": "And my belief is, the reason that people don't have it is not because they don't want it but because they can't afford it."}
{"original": "And so I emphasize reducing costs."}
{"original": "And as has been noted by many observers, including Bill Clinton's former secretary of labor, my plan does more than anybody to reduce costs, and there is nobody out there who wants health insurance who can't have it."}
{"original": "OBAMA: Now, there are legitimate arguments for why Senator Clinton and others have called for a mandate, and I'm happy to have that debate."}
{"original": "But the notion that I am leaving 15 million people out somehow implies that we are different in our goals of providing coverage to all Americans, and that is simply not true. We think that there's going to be a different way of getting there."}
{"original": "One last point I want to make on the health care front. I admire the fact that Senator Clinton tried to bring about health care reform back in 1993. She deserves credit for that."}
{"original": "But I said before, I think she did it in the wrong way, because it wasn't just the fact that the insurance companies, the drug companies were battling here, and no doubt they were. It was also that Senator Clinton and the administration went behind closed doors, excluded the participation even of Democratic members of Congress who had slightly different ideas than the ones that Senator Clinton had put forward."}
{"original": "And, as a consequence, it was much more difficult to get Congress to cooperate."}
{"original": "OBAMA: And I've said that I'm going to do things differently. I think we have to open up the process. Everybody has to have a seat at the table. And most importantly, the American people have to be involved and educated about how this change is going to be brought about."}
{"original": "The point is this, you know, we can have great plans, but if we don't change how the politics is working in Washington, then neither of our plans are going to happen, and we're going to be four years from now debating once again how we're going to bring universal health care to this country."}
{"original": "BROWN: All right, we've got some time constraints here, so we've got to take another real quick break. Stay with us. We've got a lot more ahead."}
{"original": "You can compare the candidates on the issues any time; just go to our Web site, Cnnpolitics.com. A lot more ahead here at the University of Texas. We'll be right back."}
{"original": "BROWN: An enthusiastic crowd here at the University of Texas."}
{"original": "Welcome back to the Texas Democratic debate. Let's get right to it. Jorge Ramos with the next question."}
{"original": "RAMOS: Senator Clinton, yesterday you said, and I'm quoting, One of us is ready to be commander in chief."}
{"original": "Are you saying that Senator Obama is not ready and not qualified to be commander in chief?"}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, I believe that I am ready and I am prepared. And I will leave that to the voters to decide."}
{"original": "But I want to get back to health care, because I didn't get a chance to respond after Senator Obama finished. No, let me finish, Jorge..."}
{"original": "RAMOS: But I would like to come back..."}
{"original": "CLINTON: This is a significant difference. You know, Senator Obama has said it's a philosophical difference. I think it's a substantive difference."}
{"original": "He has a mandate for parents to be sure to ensure their children. I agree with that. I just know that if we don't go and require everyone to have health insurance, the health insurance industry will still game the system. Everyone of us with insurance will pay the hidden tax of approximately $900 a year to make up for the lack of insurance."}
{"original": "And you know, in one of our earlier debates, John Edwards made a great point. It would be as though Social Security were voluntary. Medicare, one of the great accomplishments of President Johnson, was voluntary."}
{"original": "I do not believe that is going to work. So it's not just a philosophical difference."}
{"original": "CLINTON: You look at what will work and what will not work. If you do not have a plan that starts out attempting to achieve universal health care, you will be nibbled to death, and we will be back here with more and more people uninsured and rising costs."}
{"original": "BROWN: All right. We appreciate that you want to make a point, Senator Obama. We have limited time, so I would like Jorge to move on to another subject or we're going to be out of time."}
{"original": "OBAMA: Well, I understand. But I think that Senator Clinton made a..."}
{"original": "You know, she's making a point, and I think I should have the opportunity to respond very briefly. And I'll try to make..."}
{"original": "OBAMA: Number one, understand that when Senator Clinton says a mandate, it's not a mandate on government to provide health insurance, it's a mandate on individuals to purchase it. And Senator Clinton is right; we have to find out what works."}
{"original": "OBAMA: Now, Massachusetts has a mandate right now. They have exempted 20 percent of the uninsured because they have concluded that that 20 percent can't afford it."}
{"original": "In some cases, there are people who are paying fines and still can't afford it, so now they're worse off than they were. They don't have health insurance and they're paying a fine."}
{"original": "In order for you to force people to get health insurance, you've got to have a very harsh penalty, and Senator Clinton has said that we won't go after their wages. Now, this is a substantive difference. But understand that both of us seek to get universal health care. I have a substantive difference with Senator Clinton on how to get there."}
{"original": "CLINTON: Wait a minute, no, this is too important. This is the number one issue that people talk to me about. You know, when a mother grabs my arm and says, I can't get the operation my son needs because I don't have health insurance, it is personal for me."}
{"original": "CLINTON: And I just fundamentally disagree."}
{"original": "You know, Senator Obama's plan has a mandate on parents and a fine if parents do not..."}
{"original": "CLINTON: Because he recognizes that unless we have some kind of restriction, we will not get there."}
{"original": "CLINTON: He's also said that if people show up at a hospital sick, without health insurance, well, maybe at that point you can fine them."}
{"original": "We would not have a social compact with Social Security and Medicare if everyone did not have to participate. I want a universal health care plan."}
{"original": "OBAMA: Now, that's -- that mother -- that mother who is desperate to get health care for her child, will be able to get that health care under my plan. Point number one."}
{"original": "Point number two, the reason a mandate for children can be effective is we've got an ability to make affordable health care available to that child, right now."}
{"original": "OBAMA: There are no excuses. If a parent is not providing health care for that child, it's because the parent's not being responsible, under my plan. And those children don't have a choice. But I think that adults are going to be able to see that they can afford it, under my plan; they will get it, under my plan."}
{"original": "And it is true that, if it turns out that some are gaming the system, then we can impose, potentially, some penalties on them for gaming the system."}
{"original": "But the notion that, somehow, I am interested in leaving out 15 million people, without health insurance, is simply not true."}
{"original": "BROWN: OK. Jorge -- let's let Jorge re-ask his question, because I don't think anyone remembers that one."}
{"original": "RAMOS: Let me try again, and not in Spanish, OK?"}
{"original": "Here we go again. Because we also believe the war in Iraq is very important."}
{"original": "And here's the question. Are you suggesting that Senator Obama is not ready; he doesn't have the experience to be commander in chief? That's a question of: What did you mean by that phrase?"}
{"original": "CLINTON: What I mean is that, you know, for more than 15 years, I've been honored to represent our country in more than 80 countries to negotiate on matters such as opening borders for refugees during the war in Kosovo, to stand up for women's rights as human rights around the world. I've served on the Senate..."}
{"original": "I've served on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I have worked as one of the leaders in the Congress on behalf of Homeland Security in the very difficult challenges we face."}
{"original": "You know, just this week, it's a good example. We had elections in Pakistan, we had change in government in Cuba -- or at least the leadership. We've had the elections that, you know, should have happened that haven't happened and just changed the leader the way they do in Cuba. We've had Kosovo declaring independence, and we have had our embassy set on fire in Serbia."}
{"original": "So we have serious problems that pose a real question about presidential leadership, and also some great opportunities. You know, we now have opportunities perhaps with Cuba, I hope with President Musharraf, for him to do the right thing."}
{"original": "CLINTON: I supported the independence of Kosovo because I think it is imperative that in the heart of Europe we continue to promote independence and democracy. And I would be moving very aggressively to hold the Serbian government responsible with their security forces to protect our embassy. Under international law, they should be doing that."}
{"original": "So when you think about everything that is going to happen, what we can predict and what we cannot predict, I believe that I am prepared and ready on day one to be commander in chief, to be the president, to turn our economy around, and to begin making a lot of these very difficult decisions that we will inherit from George Bush. And that is what I am putting forth to the voters."}
{"original": "OBAMA: I wouldn't be running if I didn't think I was prepared to be commander-in-chief."}
{"original": "My number one job as president will be to keep the American people safe. I will do whatever is required to accomplish that. I will not hesitate to act against those that would do America harm."}
{"original": "Now, that involves maintaining the strongest military on earth, which means that we are training our troops properly and equipping them properly, and putting them on proper rotations. And there are an awful lot of families here in Texas who have been burdened under two and three and four tours because of the poor planning of the current commander-in-chief, and that will end when I am president."}
{"original": "OBAMA: But it also means using our military wisely. And on what I believe was the single most important foreign policy decision of this generation, whether or not to go to war in Iraq, I believe I showed the judgment of a commander in chief. And I think that Senator Clinton was wrong in her judgments on that."}
{"original": "Now, that has consequences -- that has significant consequences, because it has diverted attention from Afghanistan where al Qaeda, that killed 3,000 Americans, are stronger now than at any time since 2001."}
{"original": "You know, I've heard from an Army captain who was the head of a rifle platoon -- supposed to have 39 men in a rifle platoon. Ended up being sent to Afghanistan with 24 because 15 of those soldiers had been sent to Iraq."}
{"original": "OBAMA: And as a consequence, they didn't have enough ammunition, they didn't have enough humvees. They were actually capturing Taliban weapons, because it was easier to get Taliban weapons than it was for them to get properly equipped by our current commander in chief."}
{"original": "Now, that's a consequence of bad judgment. And you know, the question is, on the critical issues that we face right now, who's going to show the judgment to lead? And I think that on every critical issue that we've seen in foreign policy over the last several years -- going into Iraq originally, I didn't just oppose it for the sake of opposing it."}
{"original": "I said this is going to distract us from Afghanistan; this is going to fan the flames of anti-American sentiment; it's going to cost us billions of dollars and thousands of lives and overstretch our military. And I was right."}
{"original": "On the question of Pakistan, which Senator Clinton just raised -- we just had an election there. But I've said very clearly that we have put all our eggs in the Musharraf basket. That was a mistake. We should be going after al Qaeda and making sure that Pakistan is serious about hunting down terrorists, as well as expanding democracy. And I was right about that."}
{"original": "On the issues that have come up that a commander in chief is going to have to make decisions on, I have shown the judgment to lead. That is the leadership that I want to show when I'm president of the United States."}
{"original": "OBAMA: On the issues that have come up, that a commander in chief is going to have to make decisions on, I have shown the judgment to lead. That is the leadership that I want to show when I'm president of the United States."}
{"original": "BROWN: All right. We're going to stay with this and stay on Iraq."}
{"original": "KING: I want to continue in this vein, and hone in on the very point you just made. Because one of you, unless this remarkable campaign here takes another wacky, unpredictable turn, is going to be running against a decorated war hero, who is going to say that you don't have the experience to be commander in chief."}
{"original": "And you have both said, it's not about that type of experience; it's about judgment."}
{"original": "You both had to make a judgment, a short time ago, in your job in the United States Senate, about whether to support the surge. And as that was going on, Senator Clinton, you had the commanding general in Iraq before you. And you said, I think that the reports provide to us really require the willing suspension of disbelief -- your words to General Petraeus."}
{"original": "KING: I want you to look at Iraq now and listen to those who say the security situation is better. Ideal, no, but better -- some say significantly, in recent days, even some steps toward a political reconciliation."}
{"original": "Is Iraq today better off than it was six months or a year ago because of the surge?"}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, John, I think you forget a very important premise of the surge. The rationale of the surge was to create the space and time for the Iraqi government to make the decisions that only it can make."}
{"original": "Now, there is no doubt, given the skill and the commitment of our young men and women in uniform that putting more of them in will give us a tactical advantage and will provide security in some places, and that has occurred."}
{"original": "CLINTON: But the fact is that the purpose of it has not been fulfilled. The Iraqi government has slowly inched toward making a few of the decisions in a less than complete way, but it hasn't taken advantage of the sacrifice and the losses of life and billions of dollars that have occurred since the surge began."}
{"original": "That is why I have said, upon taking office I would ask the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and my security advisers to give me a plan so that I could begin withdrawing our troops within 60 days."}
{"original": "And I would begin that with..."}
{"original": "... with a very clear message to the Iraqis that they no longer had a blank check, as they had been given by President Bush, that as we withdraw our troops, probably one to two brigades a month, they would have to step up and make these decisions."}
{"original": "CLINTON: I believe that is in the best interest of our military, which has been stretched thin."}
{"original": "Last night in Brownsville, you know, a woman grabbed my hand and said, Please, my husband's there for the third time. Bring him home."}
{"original": "And I told her privately what I have said publicly many times -- I will bring him home because I do not think it is in the interest of America or of the Iraqis that we continue to be there. It is up to the Iraqis to decide the kind of future they will have."}
{"original": "BROWN: Senator Obama, in the same vein, you were also opposed to the surge from the beginning. Were you wrong?"}
{"original": "OBAMA: Well, I think it is indisputable that we've seen violence reduced in Iraq. And that's a credit to our brave men and women in uniform."}
{"original": "In fact, you know, the 1st Cavalry, out of Fort Hood, played an enormous role in pushing back al Qaeda out of Baghdad."}
{"original": "OBAMA: And, you know, we honor their service."}
{"original": "But this is a tactical victory imposed upon a huge strategic blunder."}
{"original": "And I think that, when we're having a debate with John McCain, it is going to be much easier for the candidate who was opposed to the concept of invading Iraq in the first place to have a debate about the wisdom of that decision..."}
{"original": "... than having to argue about the tactics subsequent to the decision."}
{"original": "Because, ultimately, that's what's at stake. Understand, not only have we been diverted from Afghanistan. We've been diverted from focusing on Latin America."}
{"original": "We contribute -- our entire foreign aid to Latin America is $2.7 billion, approximately what we spend in Iraq in a week."}
{"original": "OBAMA: And it is any surprise, then, that you've seen people like Hugo Chavez and countries like China move into the void, because we've been neglectful of that."}
{"original": "Iran is the single biggest strategic beneficiary of us having invaded Iraq, and that is something that I think John McCain has to come to terms with."}
{"original": "So that is a debate that I'm happy to have."}
{"original": "One last point I want to make on this, and that is, the incredible burden that has been placed on the American people, starting with military families, and the fact that we still are not doing right by our veterans, that we still don't honor their service, that there are still homeless veterans, that we still don't screen properly for post-traumatic stress disorder and make sure that they're getting mental services that they need, that we are still..."}
{"original": "... having veterans in south Texas have to drive 250 miles to access a veterans hospital."}
{"original": "OBAMA: That's unacceptable. But we talked about the economy earlier, the fact that we're spending $12 billion every month in Iraq means that we can't engage in the kind of infrastructure improvements that are going to make us more competitive. It means that we can't deliver on the kinds of health care reforms that both Senator Clinton and I are looking for."}
{"original": "And that is also an argument that we have to have with John McCain because he has said that he is willing to have these troops over there for 100 years. The notion that we would sustain that kind of effort and neglect not only making us more secure here at home, more competitive here at home, allow our economy to sink. As John McCain says, he doesn't really understand the economy that well. It is clear from his embrace of George Bush's policies that he doesn't, and that's what I intend to change when I am president of the United States of America."}
{"original": "BROWN: All right. We've got to take another quick break. We've got a lot more ahead. Stay with us. We'll be right back."}
{"original": "BROWN: Welcome back to the Texas Democratic debate."}
{"original": "Stay with us after the debate. Anderson Cooper and the best political team on television will have lots of analysis."}
{"original": "Both of you have been harshly critical of the Bush administration for its secrecy, what you consider overuse of secrecy and executive power."}
{"original": "Tonight, Senator Obama, you've talked about more transparency. You also at one point criticized earmarks."}
{"original": "And yet, a recent report came out that identified you -- lower on the list in terms how much money senators seek and sneak into the budget for these pork barrel spending projects, but it still said you were responsible for $91 million in earmarks."}
{"original": "And you have refused to say where the money went, what it's for. Why?"}
{"original": "OBAMA: No, that's not true. We've actually disclosed, John, all our earmarks. And so, you know, we'll be happy to provide you with that information, because I believe very strongly in transparency."}
{"original": "OBAMA: As I indicated earlier, one of the things that I did last year was to pass a bill with Tom Coburn, very conservative Republican but a sincere fiscal conservative. And we got together and created what we call Google for Government. It's a searchable database, where every single dollar of federal spending is posted on the Internet, so that ordinary voters can take a look. And if they see a bridge to nowhere being built, they know where it's going and who sponsored it. And if they see a no-bid contract going to Halliburton, they can check that out, too."}

{"original": "OBAMA: Now, keep in mind, a lot of these are worthy projects in our states. I have actively pursued projects that I think are important. But I want to make sure that they're not done in the dark of night, that they're not done in committee, that everybody stands up and says, this is the kind of spending that I think is important."}
{"original": "I have consistently supported those efforts. I will push for those as president of the United States of America."}
{"original": "KING: Senator Clinton, as you know, I think your number was about $342 million. You say they're worthy projects, as Senator Obama did, for your state and that's part of your job, to get money for worthy projects back in your state."}

{"original": "On the specific issue of pork barrel spending, fiscal accountability by the government at a time when many Americans frankly think, whether it is the House or the Senate, that you all waste money on things that aren't important to them, don't affect their daily lives, does he have a better case to make to the American people that, I have done this my entire career; I will do it as president, on the issue of on the issue of wasteful pork barrel spending?"}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, no, not at all. Because he supported the wasteful tax cuts of the Bush administration and the Iraq war, with the billions of dollars..."}
{"original": "... that have been spent, and wants it to continue."}
{"original": "You know, when President Bush came into office, he inherited a balanced budget and a surplus. And it is gone. And we now are looking at a projected deficit of $400 billion, under the new Bush budget, and a $9 trillion debt."}
{"original": "We borrow money from the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis. That is not a winning strategy for America."}
{"original": "I will get us back to fiscal responsibility. And I will make it clear that the Bush tax cuts on the upper income, those making more than $250,000 a year, will be allowed to expire."}
{"original": "CLINTON: Middle-class tax cuts and support for the middle class, to make college affordable, retirement security possible, health insurance affordable: Those will be my priorities."}
{"original": "And I think it's important that we look at where the money has gone under President Bush -- no-bid contracts, cronyism, outsourcing the government in ways that haven't saved us money and have reduced accountability."}
{"original": "So the larger question is, who really is going to move us toward fiscal responsibility, and I believe that we can get back on the path we were on. It was working well. It was one of the reasons why the economy was booming."}
{"original": "I've got that, you know, clearly in my economic blueprint, which is something that I've published the last few days, because it's part of what we have to do again. And I think that I will be very comfortable and effective in taking on Senator McCain over the fiscal irresponsibility of the Republican Party that he's been a part of."}

{"original": "CLINTON: Well, you know, these are the rules that are followed, and you know, I think that it will sort itself out. I'm not worried about that. We will have a nominee, and we will have a unified Democratic Party, and we will go on to victory in November."}
{"original": "BROWN: Senator Obama, go ahead. Do you have a response to Senator Clinton?"}

{"original": "... the will of the voters, expressed in this long election process, is what ultimately will determine who our next nominee is going to be."}
{"original": "OBAMA: But understand what I think is most important to the voters, and that is that we have a government that is listening to them again. They feel as if they've been shut out."}
{"original": "You know, when I meet mothers who are trying to figure out how to get health care for their kids, it's not just the desperation of that single mom. It's also that when they try to find some help, oftentimes they're hitting a brick wall."}
{"original": "And they don't get a sense that the debates that are happening in Washington right now relate to them at all. And what they believe is that people are trying to get on TV and they're trying to score points and they're trying to win elections, and that they're not interested in knocking down the barriers that stand between the American people and their dreams."}
{"original": "And I have no doubt that the Democratic Party at its best can summon a sense of common purpose again and higher purpose for the American people."}
{"original": "OBAMA: And I think that the next nominee going into the November election is going to have a lot to talk about because the American people are tired of politics that is dominated by the powerful, by the connected. They want their government back, and that's what I intend to provide them when I'm nominated for president of the United States."}
{"original": "BROWN: We have time for just one final question, and we thought we would sort of end on a more philosophical question. You've both spent a lot of time talking about leadership, about who's ready and who has the right judgment to lead if elected president."}
{"original": "A leader's judgment is most tested at times of crisis. I'm wondering if both of you will describe what was the moment that tested you the most, that moment of crisis."}
{"original": "OBAMA: Well, you know, I wouldn't point to a single moment. But what I look at is the trajectory of my life because, you know, I was raised by a single mom. My father left when I was two, and I was raised by my mother and my grandparents."}
{"original": "And, you know, there were rocky periods during my youth, when I made mistakes and was off course. And what was most important, in my life, was learning to take responsibility for my own actions, learning to take responsibility for not only my own actions but how I can bring people together to actually have an impact on the world."}
{"original": "And so, working as a community organizer on the streets of Chicago, with ordinary people, bringing them together and organizing them to provide jobs and health care, economic security to people who didn't have it, then working as a civil rights attorney and rejecting the jobs on Wall Street to fight for those who were being discriminated against on the job -- that cumulative experience, I think, is the judgment that I now bring."}
{"original": "OBAMA: It's the reason that I have the capacity to bring people together, and it's the reason why I am determined to make sure that the American people get a government that is worthy of their decency and their generosity."}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, I think everybody here knows I've lived through some crises and some challenging moments in my life. And..."}
{"original": "And I am grateful for the support and the prayers of countless Americans."}
{"original": "But people often ask me, How do you do it? You know, How do you keep going? And I just have to shake my head in wonderment, because with all of the challenges that I've had, they are nothing compared to what I see happening in the lives of Americans every single day. along with Senator McCain, as the only two elected officials, to speak at the opening at the Intrepid Center at Brooke Medical Center in San Antonio, a center designed to take care of and provide rehabilitation for our brave young men and women who have been injured in war."}
{"original": "And I remember sitting up there and watching them come in. Those who could walk were walking. Those who had lost limbs were trying with great courage to get themselves in without the help of others. Some were in wheelchairs and some were on gurneys. And the speaker representing these wounded warriors had had most of his face disfigured by the results of fire from a roadside bomb."}
{"original": "CLINTON: You know, the hits I've taken in life are nothing compared to what goes on every single day in the lives of people across our country."}
{"original": "And I resolved at a very young age that I'd been blessed and that I was called by my faith and by my upbringing to do what I could to give others the same opportunities and blessings that I took for granted."}
{"original": "That's what gets me up in the morning. That's what motivates me in this campaign."}
{"original": "And, you know, no matter what happens in this contest -- and I am honored, I am honored to be here with Barack Obama. I am absolutely honored."}
{"original": "CLINTON: Whatever happens, we're going to be fine. You know, we have strong support from our families and our friends. I just hope that we'll be able to say the same thing about the American people, and that's what this election should be about."}

{"original": "But Joe Biden's inauguration on Wednesday will be a day of dispossession for millions more Americans who saw Trump as a lone leader who voiced their fear that the modern world scorns their religion, culture, livelihoods and patriotism."}
{"original": "When people look at Trump and say, This is not America, they are wrong. His presidency personified a gap between America's liberal, urban, multiracial citizens and their White, rural, conservative counterparts. And his great sin as President was that he didn't try to build common bonds and language between an internally estranged people. Instead, he exploited the divide."}
{"original": "These facts are indisputable: Trump destroyed millions of people's faith in the US political system by refusing to accept his election defeat and inciting an insurrection against Congress. He inspired radical, far right White nationalists. He lied every day. His beautiful health care plan was a sick myth. He torched America's global reputation. And he incessantly exploited his job to boost his business, reversing President John Kennedy's admonition, Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country."}
{"original": "Trump did often raise questions that conventional politicians dodged: Shouldn't the US be tougher on an increasingly hostile China? When will someone actually help ghost towns in the Midwest and the South where industries died at the hands of elite free traders? Why don't prosperous Europeans pay more for their own defense? What is the sense in sending heartland Americans to die in the Middle East?"}

But since his supporters sacked Congress, the guest list for his early morning farewell at Joint Base Andrews may no longer be a hot ticket.

{"original": "It's a bittersweet milestone for GM (GM) because it means that a $7,500 government tax credit for its customers will soon expire."}
{"original": "The government designed the tax credit to phase out over the course of a year after an automaker has sold that many plug-in cars to US buyers."}
{"original": "The credit starts to phase out three months after the end of the quarter in which an automaker hits that mark. That means Chevrolet Bolt or Volt buyers will be out of luck starting in April because GM hit the mark in the fourth quarter."}
{"original": "Tesla (TSLA) became the first automaker to cross the milestone in July. On January 1, its buyers began getting only half the tax credit, or $3,750. In six months the tax credit will fall another 50% to $1,875. The credit goes away completely a year after the phase-out begins."}
{"original": "GM has said it wants the government to stop the tax credit from phasing out. Plug-in sales could be tougher once it expires."}
{"original": "GM already reported lower sales for its plug-in cars in the fourth quarter and for the year. Sales of the Bolt, an all-electric car, fell 23% in 2018. Sales of the Volt, which has both an electric motor and a gasoline engine, fell 10%."}
{"original": "Unlike Tesla, which responded to the phase-out by cutting the price of its cars by $2,000, GM has indicated no plans to subsidize the purchase price for its customers."}

There was : This is just not true -- even leaving aside the fact that insurrectionists near the Capitol could have listened to Trump's speech on their phones or could have been inspired by Trump's previous rhetoric. There was more than enough time for people to walk about a mile and a half from The Ellipse park, where Trump gave a speech that ended before 1:15 p.m. ET, to the Capitol, where rioters were still present more than three hours after Trump concluded. In fact, the FBI alleges that some insurrection participants did make this walk , including one who allegedly went from the Trump speech to her hotel and then into the Capitol."}
{"original": "Abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America tweeted the following about the insurrection: Anti-choice extremists, white supremacists, and violent misogynists all converged this week to attack our country. But the thing is, these groups already have a lot of overlap. What we saw was horrifying and devastating. But it wasn't surprising."}
{"original": "Greene responded that the Capitol attack was terrible and shouldn't have happened -- but then added that all of the people who died as a result of the insurrection were White, so I'm not sure where your white supremacy bs is coming from."}
{"original": "Facts First: According to the FBI, it is true, not bs, that White supremacists were involved in the insurrection. (Also, the fact that people killed at the Capitol were White obviously does not mean White supremacists could not have been among the perpetrators. Some of the people killed had been participants in the insurrection. And White supremacists sometimes kill other White people.)"}
{"original": "The FBI alleges that Bryan Betancur, who has been charged for alleged involvement in the insurrection, is is a self-professed White supremacist who has made statements to law enforcement officers that he is a member of several white supremacy organizations.

{"original": "Facts First: This is, again, just false. There is no evidence of mass voter fraud -- as Republican : This is, again, just false.

{"original": "Facts First: All three claims are false. Biden won the election, fairly and legally. There is no evidence to suggest otherwise. Trump's various claims about supposed fraud and supposed election-rigging have been rejected in court and debunked at length by officials and fact checkers."}
{"original": "Greene criticized Gabriel Sterling , a senior official in the office of Georgia's top elections official, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.

{"original": "Facts First: Nobody crushed the First Amendment on January 8. Greene didn't explicitly say she was talking about Twitter's decision to suspend Trump's account, but if she was, she was clearly inaccurate. The First Amendment prohibits the government from silencing citizens, but it does not require corporations, including social media companies like Twitter, to allow citizens to speak freely."}

{"original": "When we think of the countless Americans who are forced to live paycheck to paycheck, we tend to picture low to middle earners with little wiggle room for unplanned expenses. But apparently, it's not just those with limited income who can't seem to bank any money at month's end."}
{"original": "In fact, one in 10 Americans earning over $100,000 a year is living paycheck to paycheck, according to data from CreditLoan."}
{"original": "Why are higher earners struggling so? Often, it's a matter of taking on too many expenses and not having adequate reserves. It's estimated that 57% of the adult population has less than $1,000 in immediate savings, while 39% of Americans have no savings at all. Clearly, higher earners are included in this sample set, as evidenced by the fact that so many have a hard time making ends meet."}
{"original": "If you're earning upward of $100,000 a year yet are trapped in the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle, it's on you to take steps to change your habits. Otherwise, you risk not only falling deep into debt, but also ruining your finances irreparably the moment an unexpected bill falls in your lap."}
{"original": "If you're tired of living paycheck to paycheck, then the first thing you need to do is create a budget that maps out your various expenses. Simply list your recurring bills, factor in less frequent expenses -- like that once-a-year insurance premium you pay -- and compare what you typically spend to the amount of post-tax income you bring home. If the numbers don't align -- meaning you find that you're spending down your entire paycheck, and then some -- then you'll need to start cutting back. Immediately."}
{"original": "In an ideal world, we'd all be able to live the lifestyle we want without having to compromise. In reality, however, life's luxuries cost money, and if your earnings -- no matter how high they happen to be -- don't support them, then you'll need to start making changes."}
{"original": "Once you have that budget in place, examine it to determine which current expenses you're willing to slash. Keep in mind that there's no right or wrong answer. Rather, your goal should be to free up as much cash as possible in your budget while causing yourself and your family the least amount of unhappiness in the process."}
{"original": "So think about what sounds worse: living in a smaller home, or giving up the restaurant food you typically enjoy three nights a week or more. Similarly, would you rather not take vacation, or drive a less impressive-looking car? The choice is ultimately yours, but you'll need to commit to some changes if you're tired of counting down the days till your next paycheck arrives so you can pay the bills."}
{"original": "The fact that you're a relatively high earner with little to no savings probably means that setting money aside on the regular isn't your strong suit. So don't give yourself the option to overspend. Rather, arrange for a portion of each paycheck to filter directly into savings, and forget it exists. You can set up an automatic transfer with your bank so that part of your earnings land in a savings account."}
{"original": "Once you've established a near-term safety net, it's time to focus on the future. If your employer offers a 401(k), you're in luck, because all you need to do to participate is decide how much of each paycheck you wish to contribute, and that amount will automatically get deducted (pre-tax) from your earnings. It's as simple as that."}
{"original": "If you don't have a 401(k) through work, you can open an IRA that offers an automatic savings option as well. The point is to take savings matters out of your own hands if you feel you can't be trusted to make the right choices. Even if you are looking to change your ways, it still pays to go the automatic route for the sake of convenience."}

And all of those were big events, and we did notice a spike in business, but nothing on the order of what we are seeing right now."}
{"original": "Weapons dealers in much of the United States are reporting sharply higher sales since Barack Obama won the presidency a week ago."}

{"original": "According to FBI figures for the week of November 3 to 9, the bureau received more than 374,000 requests for background checks on gun purchasers -- a nearly 49 percent increase over the same period in 2007. Conatser said his store, Virginia Arms Company, has run out of some models -- such as the AR-15 rifle, the civilian version of the military's M-16 -- and is running low on others."}

{"original": "But Peter Hamm, a spokesman for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, called the buying spree goofy. He said widespread talk of banning guns is a sales pitch."}
{"original": "With the glacial speed that we make progress on sensible gun laws, savvy gun consumers should know better than to think they have to rush out and buy guns, Hamm said. Similar surges accompanied the election of Bill Clinton, the last Democratic president, he added."}
{"original": "Dealers in Colorado, Ohio, Connecticut and New Hampshire also reported seeing major increases."}
{"original": "It's a fact that the liberal Democrats that now control all three branches of our government do not like guns. They want us out of business, Connecticut resident Scott Hoffman said. They don't want the average American to have a right to defend themselves."}
{"original": "And New Hampshire gun owner Lloyd Clement said, I think there's going to be an attack to some degree on the gun owners."}
{"original": "The Clinton administration imposed a ban on several types of military-style semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity magazines in 1994, but that ban was allowed to lapse in 2004. Obama has proposed restoring the ban, requiring background checks for buyers at gun shows, and other common-sense measures."}
{"original": "He has said he supports the rights of local governments to set their own gun laws, but believes the Second Amendment to the Constitution protects individual gun rights."}
{"original": "I believe the Second Amendment means something. I do think it speaks to an individual right, Obama said in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in February."}
{"original": "With the U.S. economy in a tailspin, however, the president-elect's advisers say gun legislation is not a high priority."}
{"original": "What people do is their own business, and if they decide to go out and buy guns they'll go out and buy guns, assuming that they are eligible to buy guns, John Podesta, the co-chairman of Obama's transition team, told reporters Sunday. But I think that President-elect Obama has been clear in his campaign that what he wants to focus on is the economy, trying to get jobs growing again, dealing with the health care crisis, and dealing with our dependence on foreign oil."}
{"original": "Some customers are stocking up specifically on ammunition and point to concerns raised by the National Rifle Association, which ran anti-Obama ads during the campaign."}
{"original": "The NRA said Obama would support a huge new tax on my guns and ammo, referencing a 1999 article in a Chicago newspaper saying the then-Illinois state senator promoted a plan to increase federal taxes by 500 percent on the sales of firearms and ammunition."}
{"original": "But as a state legislator, Obama would not have had any control over federal taxes. And as a U.S. senator and presidential candidate, he has not introduced or promoted such a proposal."}

{"original": "When people talk about the oppressed, they usually refer to groups like racial minorities or gays and lesbians. But a new book shows how corporations successfully staged their own freedom movement by employing tactics associated with civil rights struggles: civil disobedience, test court cases and portraying themselves as victims of political persecution."}
{"original": "In We The Corporations: How American Businesses Won Their Civil Rights, UCLA law professor Adam Winkler details how corporations waged a two century-long campaign to win nearly the same rights as ordinary people: freedom of speech, religious liberty and personhood – the notion former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney alluded to when he said, Corporations are people, my friend."}

{"original": "That decision was widely criticized, but questions over corporate power in politics persist. Facebook has been accused of swaying a presidential election.

{"original": "They successfully argued that their equal rights were being violated by unwanted regulations and taxes. And they engaged in civil disobedience by refusing to pay what they considered unlawful taxes, deliberately breaking the law to send test cases to court."}
{"original": "We think of the Supreme Court as a bulwark to protect minorities, Winkler says, but it's used that power much more often to protect the rich and powerful."}
{"original": "In one of the most astonishing sections in the book, Winkler recounts how the corporations and the court transformed the 14th Amendment – designed to protect the basic rights of freed slaves after the Civil War – into a weapon to boost corporate power."}
{"original": "The 14th Amendment was converted from a shield for the rights of racial minorities – who found little protection from the Supreme Court for the next half-century – into a weapon for corporations to use against state laws regulating business activity."}
{"original": "Winkler recently sat down with CNN to talk about the book. This interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity:"}
{"original": "Q: A lot of people complain about the growing power of corporate money in politics, particularly after the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision. You say that it's difficult for courts to control the power of corporations in politics. Why is that?"}
{"original": "A: We think of the courts as being a place of equal justice, of Lady Justice being blind to the relative finances of the parties. But the court system is also uniquely designed for those with money to take advantage. And corporations, unlike civil rights organizations, have had the resources to hire the best, most creative and most experienced lawyers in the country to represent their interests in court."}
{"original": "Corporations have the resources and the willingness to think of litigation as just the cost of doing business. They fight over and over again to challenge nearly any law in court that regulates their activities in ways they don't like. It takes money to bring lawsuits, and they have the money to bring the lawsuits."}
{"original": "Q: How did the 14th Amendment become this weapon to benefit the powerful?"}
{"original": "A: It's one of the most remarkable turnarounds in constitutional law. Corporations have been able to turn progressive reforms into reforms that help business and capital."}
{"original": "PHOTO: Getty Images Lawyers successfully argued that corporations, like slaves, were victims of oppression."}
{"original": "The perfect example is the 14th Amendment, adopted after the Civil War to protect the rights of the newly freed slaves. But the Southern Pacific Railroad company 15 years later went to the Supreme Court and said this provision protects corporations, too. And eventually the Supreme Court would agree."}
{"original": "In 1913, there was a study of Supreme Court cases under the 14th Amendment, and it discovered that the Supreme Court had, over the past half a century, heard 28 14th Amendment cases on the rights of African-Americans – most of them ruling against African-Americans. And at the same time the court heard 312 cases on the right of business corporations, with corporations winning many of those cases."}
{"original": "The 14th Amendment was adopted for the dispossessed and the outcast. But it was used more vigorously and successfully by the forces of capital."}
{"original": "Q: Why was the court so deferential to corporate power and less vigorous enforcing the rights of African-Americans?"}
{"original": "A: Part of the reason is that we misunderstand the Supreme Court. We think of it in terms of left vs. right – are they conservative or liberal. But what's united the justices over the course of American history is that they've generally been pro-business, whether they are liberal or conservative. I think that reflects our political process, the influence that corporations have in getting their presidents elected and presidents who support business."}
{"original": "And let's face it, in a capitalist system businesses will always be powerful and influential because they bring the material wealth that everyone depends on. That's why we see cities throwing money and tax breaks at corporations to come move there even when the economic benefits are not really crystal clear. So corporations are by necessity pretty powerful."}
{"original": "Q: What are the potential consequences in America if corporate power continues to grow unchecked?"}
{"original": "A: We have such a complicated relationship with corporate politics. We criticize corporations for spending money on elections in the wake of Citizens United. At the same time, we celebrate Dick's Sporting Goods when they announce they're not going to sell guns to people under the age of 21. Or we complement a private company that says we won't do business with North Carolina because they're discriminating against transgender people."}
{"original": "We have a complicated relationship with business and politics. On the one hand, we don't want business to take over our politics. On the other hand, we as consumers often recognize that business can sometimes be more responsive to our demands than elected officials are; especially in this era of partisan gerrymandering when we don't have much influence over who gets elected to office, we do have some choice about what we can do with our spending dollars."}
{"original": "Q: Is it naïve, though, to expect corporations to be a consistent force for social good? You talk in the book about corporations' primary duty, which is to their shareholders."}
{"original": "A: I think it's true that corporations can be a vehicle for public good, but it'll only happen when that public good corresponds with the business interests of that corporation. And so that's the warning sign you have to watch out for."}
{"original": "PHOTO: Joe Raedle/Getty Images In its 2014 Hobby Lobby decision, the Supreme Court for the first time explicitly recognized that corporations have religious freedom, author Adam Winkler says."}
{"original": "The same corporate power that can lead a state to say we're not going to pass a transgender bathroom bill because we're afraid of corporate boycotts can lead to a Trump tax bill, which provides massive tax breaks to corporations and hurts ordinary individuals. It's a real problem."}
{"original": "Corporations get involved in politics and assert constitutional rights not because they're seeking dignity and the kind of freedom we're looking for. They're doing it so that they can pursue profit. And profit only. We have to remember when corporations are empowered that they are always going to be directed by that profit motive."}
{"original": "Q: You talk about a time when the courts were more suspicious of corporate power in politics. What's the difference between that time and today? What was happening?"}
{"original": "A: There was a huge scandal between 1905 and 1907. It was known as The Great Wall Street Scandal. It showed that Teddy Roosevelt, who had created this public image as a trust buster who was going against corporations, was really in the pocket of big business."}
{"original": "He had won an election in 1904 with a vast majority of financing coming from corporations. This led to a huge scandal. There were investigations into how corporations were getting involved in politics. People asked, how could we stop corporations from exerting this kind of power. And we saw the rise of campaign finance laws in response to this scandal."}
{"original": "So there was the attitude that people recognized that corporations were important, but that they were important for business and making money. But they didn't have the same rights of personal liberty and personal conscience that people have. It's a lesson that today's Supreme Court has seemed to have forgotten."}
{"original": "Q: You make an interesting point near the end of the book when you talk about the Supreme Court's 1976 Buckley v. Valeo decision and the principle of equality that is basic in law."}
{"original": "A: One reason why campaign finance laws keep getting struck down by the Supreme Court is because it says there is no legitimate government interest to promote equality in the political process."}
{"original": "PHOTO: Bettmann Archive/Getty Images Roscoe Conkling, a 19th-pcentury lawyer, used deception to win for corporations rights that were added to the Constitution for freed slaves, author Adam Winkler says."}
{"original": "This is a very odd statement about politics. Equality is such an important principle in American politics. Everyone gets one vote. You don't get two votes. It's not like corporate America where shareholders can get as many votes as they can get shares for."}
{"original": "Even the contest of speech around elections, we have a principle of equality. If we have a debate we have two candidates – they get equal time to argue their positions. For a long time we even had equal time rules for the big three broadcasters. Even in oral arguments in the Supreme Court, each side gets equal time."}
{"original": "Q: If corporate power keeps expanding, where does America end up? I hear people already saying we're not a democracy but a corporatocracy. Is that hyperbole?"}
{"original": "A: I can't tell you. It's complicated. Corporations don't rule everything. But they rule in a lot of things. Political scientists often show that in issues of high public salience, like abortion or gun rights, those are issues that are not going to be affected that much by big business because people's views on those are really locked in personally."}
{"original": "But where corporations are most powerful are on regulatory issues and environmental laws, little things that people aren't paying attention to. In those issues, like the [Trump] tax bill, corporations do really well."}
{"original": "I do think we are moving into a world where corporations are gaining more power, and gaining more rights that are troublesome: rights of political speech, rights of religious liberty to give them exemption from generally applicable laws. At the same time, we are seeing people trying to use corporations to do good."}
{"original": "Ultimately, if we are going to make our society a better and more just society, we're not going to end up getting rid of corporations. We have to make corporations serve us better."}

At the time, many within his own party felt reaching out to the Soviets was a sign of willingness to negotiate with an evil dictator."}
{"original": "What made Reagan different from many of his fellow conservatives -- and different, too, from liberals who looked upon the Cold War as an eternal condition -- was that he really wanted to negotiate and thought he had learned the art of doing so by bargaining with movie producers when he was president of the Screen Actors Guild, Lou Cannon, author of several books on Reagan, wrote in a commentary for AOL News."}
{"original": "Journalist Will Bunch, author of the book Tear Down This Myth, pointed out in an interview with National Public Radio on Thursday that many forget that Reagan was divisive and had virtually zero support from African-Americans."}
{"original": "The Reagan myth is pretty simple, said Bunch, a senior writer for the Philadelphia Daily News. Basically, people want Ronald Reagan remembered as the man who won the Cold War and as the man who turned the economy around ... this idea that Reagan brought down the Berlin Wall and that he cut taxes and saved the American economy."}
{"original": "He noted that conservatives also fail to mention that Reagan raised taxes throughout his presidency and was willing to work across the aisle with Democrats on major policies such as Social Security."}
{"original": "When he had to govern, he was actually kind of a great compromiser. He was willing to make compromises to get things done. You almost never hear about the fact he reached a deal with Democrats on Social Security, Bunch said. He signed off on some sort of tax increase every year of his presidency after 1982, including one that was at the time the largest tax increase in American history to undo the fact that the '81 tax cut went too far."}
{"original": "Brinkley said conservatives forget that he was actually influenced by President Franklin D.

{"original": "The praise for his economic policies, though, is somewhat inflated, Cannon argued."}
{"original": "His greatest domestic accomplishment -- breaking the back of inflation that terrified the nation in the late 1970s -- was a product not of 'supply side' economics ballyhooed by conservatives, but of the drastic tightening of interest rates by Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, Cannon wrote. Volcker later became the chairman of President Obama's Economic Recovery Advisory Board."}
{"original": "For all the criticism of the myths surrounding Reagan, his supporters point out his enormous success in restoring Americans' faith in their country through his personality, charm and effective speaking."}
{"original": "His greatest single quality was his self-deprecating humor, which came naturally to him and was honed into an effective political weapon, said Cannon, who covered the Reagan White House for The Washington Post. He made fun of his age, his work habits, his vanities, his ideology, his alleged lack of intelligence and his supposed domination by his wife [Nancy]."}
{"original": "Brinkley added: Reagan had a healthy smelling-salts effect on the economy. Somehow, by talking about the power of the corporation again and why business was good for America, he was able to instill confidence in the market and also kind of do some things that were beneficial for America's trade policy. So it's not just a claim of this percentage or that percent but some of Reagan's leadership and tone and tenor."}
{"original": "That tone also reached the ears of Democrats frustrated by Jimmy Carter's presidency. A new band of Reagan Democrats sprang up -- something championed today by conservatives and Democrats looking to invoke Reagan as a guidepost for a successful presidency."}
{"original": "One of those Democrats appears to be Obama, who has praised Reagan and defended him against liberal critics. During Obama's December vacation in Hawaii, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs tweeted that the president was reading one of Cannon's Reagan biographies."}
{"original": "No matter what political disagreements you may have had with President Reagan -- and I certainly had my share -- there is no denying his leadership in the world, or his gift for communicating his vision for America, Obama wrote in an op-ed for USA Today."}
{"original": "Observers argue that Obama is looking to Reagan to find out how to turn around a bad economy, reach out to the other side of the aisle and restore faith in the American spirit."}
{"original": "And Obama, like Reagan, has come under fire from Republicans for negotiating with the Russians on a new nuclear arms treaty reducing missiles in both countries."}
{"original": "It was a precursor to other agreements, the most recent signed by Barack Obama, which made deeper reductions in nuclear arsenals, Rollins said. Today, U.S. and Russian specialists inspect nuclear weapons on each other's soil, an action that would have been seen as unbelievably utopian when Reagan became president."}

{"original": "That could be just a coincidence, but it's clear that after more than a month of no paycheck, government workers who keep up the country's national infrastructure were beginning to fray. Additionally, the US economy lost at least $6 billion during the shutdown, according to an estimate from S&P Global Economics."}

{"original": "The Environmental Protection Agency, which has more than 14,000 employees, has an extremely broad portfolio: protecting the environment.

{"original": "Washington (CNN) His reelection bid accelerating, President Donald Trump has again seized credit for an economic turnaround , claimed record job creation and accused his predecessor of a con job on the subject."}
{"original": "His claims make sense as a matter of bombastic Trumpian politics. All presidential incumbents surf positive economic developments on their watch in asking voters for another term. But as a matter of economics, the President's words ring as empty as his musings on North Korean denuclearization or his still non-existent proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act . Each of Trump's core economic claims lacks merit."}
{"original": "This latest contretemps got underway after former President Barack Obama sent a tweet commemorating the 11th anniversary of the Recovery Act he signed in the depths of the Great Recession he had inherited. Obama linked that $787-billion stimulus measure with the decade of economic growth, and record-long streak of job creation, that followed."}
{"original": "Those are unremarkable statements of fact. National Bureau of Economic Research analysis shows that the recession, which began in December 2007 under President George W. Bush, ended five months after the Recovery Act took effect in Obama's first year."}
{"original": "The following year, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows, American businesses definitively stopped shedding jobs. The overall economy and private sector payrolls have grown non-stop ever since."}
{"original": "He also claimed the United States would have faced big economic (Depression?) had Democrats held the presidency in the last election. That claim lacks any basis whatsoever."}
{"original": "During Obama's second term, annual economic growth rose from 1.8% in 2013, to 2.5% in 2014, to 2.9% in 2015. In his final year, growth receded to 1.6%."}
{"original": "But in August 2016, with Hillary Clinton favored to keep the White House in Democratic hands by beating Trump that November, the Congressional Budget Office forecast another acceleration. The nonpartisan office predicted the economy would grow 2.4% in 2017 before gradually settling back to a 1.9% rate in the following decade."}
{"original": "The growth rate during Trump's first year in office: precisely the 2.4% rate the Congressional Budget Office had predicted before he won."}
{"original": "Growth revved up again in 2018 after Trump and congressional Republicans enacted their own stimulus in the form of tax cuts and spending increases. It didn't reach the 3+% levels the White House had predicted, but at least it matched Obama's 2.9% mark from three years earlier."}
{"original": "Now the economy has slowed again. In its latest long-term forecast last month, the Congressional Budget Office envisions growth of 1.7% per year -- slightly lower than before Trump's presidency began."}
{"original": "Fundamental economic conditions shape the outlook for growth more than the policies of any president. But economists from both parties and Wall Street alike agree that Trump's start-and-stop trade conflicts have sapped national output by raising prices and dampening business investment. One other notable shift: the federal budget deficit has risen sharply from the levels Obama handed him."}
{"original": "So the Trump economy remains on essentially the same path as the one Obama bequeathed to him. Contrary to his claims, Trump did not steer the economy away from looming disaster toward an unlikely boom."}
{"original": "The high-profile indicators Trump loves to cite also confirm the pattern."}
{"original": "Trump's tweetstorm claimed the best jobs numbers ever. But average monthly job growth has declined from 224,000 during Obama's last three years to 182,000 during Trump's first three."}

{"original": "Lowering your tax bill is always a joy. For most taxpayers, it's fairly easy to trim down your tax liability without breaking the rules (and therefore inviting some truly nasty penalties down the road)."}
{"original": "The simplest way to manage this feat is to reduce your taxable income. That doesn't mean asking your boss for a pay cut -- rather, the idea is to make part of your income exempt from taxation. This strategy really shines when it can drop you into a lower tax bracket, because not only will you pay less in taxes, but you'll also reduce your tax rate for part of your income."}
{"original": "You've probably seen those tax charts with the income ranges on one side and a series of percentages -- 10%, 15%, 25%, etc. -- on the other side. Many people jump to the conclusion that having an income in a particular range means all of their income is taxed at that bracket's rate. Actually, tax brackets are marginal, rather than absolute. That means only the part of your income within each range is taxed at the corresponding tax rate."}
{"original": "Take a look at this 2017 tax bracket report to get an idea of what that means. If your filing status is single, and you made $50,000 in 2017, then the first $9,325 of your income would be taxed at a 10% rate (in other words, you'd owe $932.50 in taxes on that chunk of income). Your income between $9,325 and $37,950 would be taxed at a 15% rate, and the rest of your income for the year would be taxed at a 25% rate."}
{"original": "In this example, the income that the IRS hits the hardest is the bit above $37,950. But if you could turn all your income above $37,950 into nontaxable income, then the IRS would keep its hands off everything in the 25% tax bracket, and your top tax rate for the year would be 15% -- a much nicer number."}
{"original": "So if you wanted to drop into a lower tax bracket, your goal for 2017 would be to get at least $12,050 (that's $50,000 minus $37,950) of your income declared off-limits for tax purposes."}
{"original": "The IRS actually provides quite a few ways to transform taxable income into nontaxable income. They're called deductions. Yes, that's what a deduction really is -- a way to flag a piece of income as nontaxable. It's how the federal government rewards you for spending money in ways that it deems beneficial to society. The trick to maximizing your deductions is planning them out in advance so that you can be sure to reach your goal ($12,050 in this example)."}
{"original": "1. Contributing to a retirement account."}
{"original": "If your employer offers you a 401(k) account, then use it -- the contributions will typically come out of pre-tax income, so they automagically lower your taxable income without any extra work required on your part."}
{"original": "No 401(k) available? No problem. Practically any bank or brokerage firm will happily set up an individual retirement account (IRA) for you, often with low or no fees. Any contributions you make to an IRA are fully deductible (as long as your income falls below a certain threshold )."}
{"original": "Note that if you're trying to reduce your taxable income now, you'll want a traditional IRA, not a Roth IRA, which is funded with after-tax money. For 2017, you can contribute up to $18,000 into a 401(k) or up to $5,500 into an IRA. If you're aged 50 or older, the maximums go up to $24,000 and $6,500, respectively."}
{"original": "If you have a high-deductible health insurance plan, then you may qualify to open an HSA, and any contributions you make are deductible. For that matter, distributions from the HSA (when used to pay for medical expenses) are also tax-free. HSAs are definitely a taxpayer's friend. For 2017, the annual contribution limit for HSAs is $3,400 if you're on an individual health insurance plan or $6,750 if you're on a family plan."}
{"original": "3. Pay (the right kind of) interest."}
{"original": "The interest you pay on certain kinds of debt is deductible. This includes mortgage interest, student loan interest, interest on debt used to purchase investments, and interest on business debt. There is one catch, though: You can only claim interest deductions if you itemize, rather than taking the standard deduction (excepting student loan interest -- you don't have to itemize to take that one)."}
{"original": "Retirement account and HSA contributions, on the other hand, can be deducted regardless of whether you itemize. If you have a lot of itemized deductions to claim, it's probably worth your while to do so."}
{"original": "The state and local taxes that you pay, including real estate taxes, qualify as an itemized deduction. This can help push you into the itemizing makes sense category if you're close but not quite there. Note that you can deduct either state income tax or state sales tax, but not both; usually, it makes more sense to deduct the state income tax, but if your state has low or no income tax, then deducting your sales tax is the way to go."}
{"original": "Charitable contributions of up to 50% of your adjusted gross income are also deductible if you itemize. The contributions must go to a qualified charity, and both cash and property donations can be deducted (property is generally deducted at the fair market value). This is a great way to do well by doing good. If you're approaching the end of the year and you don't have quite enough itemized deductions to make itemizing worthwhile, then consider clearing out the attic and making a big donation."}

{"original": "If the year's already over and you didn't quite manage to drop into a lower tax bracket, then you have one last chance: IRA contributions made up until the deadline for the previous year's tax return can count as deductions for the previous year (usually April 15, unless that date falls on a weekend). This will only work if you're eligible to deduct IRA contributions and you haven't already maxed them out for the year, but if you meet those requirements it's a perfect last-minute save for your tax bill."}
{"original": "Atlanta (CNN) Nsenga Burton grew up in a military family that liked to travel and went everywhere from New York City and Washington, D.C., to the Caribbean."}
{"original": "There was one place, though, that her mother dreaded visiting: the Deep South."}
{"original": "Her mother saw it as a forbidding land of lynch mobs and Whites Only signs, where Black people went missing just for trying to vote.

{"original": "My mother sent me out of the country before she sent me to the Deep South, Burton says."}
{"original": "Burton, who is 48, just got a little payback. After moving to Atlanta from Maryland six years ago, she became part of a crucial bloc of Black voters who helped Democrats seize control of the US Senate. They mobilized in record numbers to elect the Rev. Raphael Warnock, a Black man from Savannah, and Jon Ossoff, a Jewish man from Atlanta."}

The descendants of the people who were pushed out of the South, who had no power, who knew they could go missing if they tried to vote, have returned and they're making it work for them. It's been a long time coming."}
{"original": "The stunning election results in Georgia have rightly been attributed to the relentless work of voting-rights organizers such as Stacey Abrams, the former gubernatorial candidate whose group, Fair Fight , is credited with registering 800,000 new voters in Georgia."}
{"original": "But those victories also happened because of a series of personal decisions made years ago by little-known transplants like Burton. They are part of what's called  The New Great Migration, and without them, Warnock and Ossoff wouldn't have stood a chance."}
{"original": "The unsung Black transplants changing the South"}
{"original": "More than a million Black people have moved to Georgia and other Southern states in the last 30 years. Many have started to flex political powers that were denied to their ancestors. They're not just winning local races for mayor and city council, they're shaping national politics."}
{"original": "What happened in Georgia this week is a culmination of this trend. Some trace the shift to President Obama's successful 2008 presidential run, when he won Virginia and North Carolina. Others cite a multiracial progressive movement called Moral Mondays that turned North Carolina from a red state into a political battleground."}
{"original": "Rev. William Barber II of North Carolina speaks during a Democratic Presidential Committee (DNC) summer meeting on August 23, 2019 in San Francisco."}
{"original": "The Rev. William Barber II, an activist and author, is credited with helping transform North Carolina into a place where the GOP cannot take victory for granted. The state now has a Democratic governor."}
{"original": "Barber, 57, says the Democratic victories in Georgia can spread throughout the South if candidates are not afraid to run on an unabashedly progressive platform, as Warnock and Ossoff did, that champions the working class."}
{"original": "Georgia doesn't have to be an anomaly, says Barber, whose parents moved to North Carolina from Indiana. Georgia literally shows what's possible when you put messaging, mobilization, and the investment of money in there."}
{"original": "He points out, though, that the newfound Black political clout in Georgia is not unprecedented. It's a return to what he calls fusion politics -- a late 19th-century movement that saw Blacks and progressive Whites change politics throughout the South."}
{"original": "Much of this progress occurred during Reconstruction, that period when Black and White voters in the South sent two Black senators to the US Senate and elected more than 2,000 Black congressmen, judges, sheriffs and tax collectors."}
{"original": "A superficial political analysis will say that the Black vote elected Warnock and Ossoff, but a serious political analysis will say that Black, White and Latino voters elected them, Barber says."}
{"original": "Atlanta is key to the New Great Migration"}
{"original": "Any serious political analysis of the Democrats' victories in Georgia must also examine Atlanta's mythical hold on Black America. The New Great Migration gave Ossoff and Warnock a more level playing field, because Atlanta has long been a top destination for Black transplants from around the country."}
{"original": "In the 1970s, Ebony and Jet magazines promoted Atlanta as the Black Mecca of the South because of its vibrant middle class, renowned Black colleges like Morehouse and Spelman, and its string of popular Black mayors like Maynard Jackson and Andrew Young. It's also been called the cradle of the civil rights movement as the birthplace of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who used the city as a home base to change the nation."}
{"original": "People pray together during a Juneteenth event at Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta on June 19, 2020."}

In 2019, 43% of eligible Black voters in Georgia were born outside of the state, according to the Pew Research Center . In the Atlanta metro area, 76% of eligible Black voters were born outside of Georgia."}
{"original": "Many of these Black transplants came because they didn't have the same fear of the South as their parents. They got active in politics and civic affairs and become what Burton calls supervoters: people who vote in local, state and national elections."}
{"original": "If there's an election for a dog catcher, supervoters are going to vote in it, Burton says."}
{"original": "They're people like Charles M. Blow, the New York Times columnist, who moved to Atlanta from New York City a year ago."}
{"original": "I chose Atlanta because many of my friends were already there, having moved to the 'hot' Southern city after college, and because I saw Georgia as on the cusp of transformational change, Blow wrote in a recent column . I say to Black people: Return to the South, cast down your anchor and create an environment in which racial oppression has no place."}
{"original": "People wait to register to vote in Macon, Georgia, in 1962. Voting rights were denied many African Americans until 1965."}
{"original": "But across the South, Black political power outside of Georgia is still uneven. Black voters in South Carolina helped send Biden to the White House when they threw their support behind his then-floundering campaign during the Democratic primaries. But they have not changed the White Republican dominance of their state."}
{"original": "Mississippi is a textbook example of why a large Black populace doesn't necessarily translate into political power. It has the highest percentage of Black people in any state -- about 38% -- but they are virtually locked out the state's political power. It doesn't have Georgia's booming economy or its influx of multiracial, college-educated transplants who tend to be progressive voters. White Republicans have dominated state politics in Mississippi since the late 19th century."}
{"original": "Some fled the South for the 'warmth of other suns'"}
{"original": "The segregated nature of Mississippi's politics is partly what led to the first Great Migration. Much of the South was an apartheid state where Blacks could lose their jobs or get killed for trying to vote. They could even be killed for whims such as reckless eyeballing -- looking at a White person the wrong way."}
{"original": "That fear stayed with many Blacks long after they left the Deep South."}
{"original": "My mom still doesn't come here now, and she's from Virginia, says Burton, who lives in a suburb of Atlanta."}
{"original": "An estimated six million Blacks left the South for the North between 1915 to 1970. They hopped on railway cars from states like Mississippi and Louisiana to head for factory jobs in cities like Chicago and Detroit. This epic migration was captured most memorably in a 2010 book by Isabel Wilkerson, The Warmth of Other Suns."}
{"original": "A group of African Americans who took part in the Great Migration to the north, in Chicago in 1918."}
{"original": "Wilkerson's book title is based on a poem by the Black author Richard Wright, who moved from the South to Chicago and wrote he was taking a part of the South to transplant in alien soil, to bend in strange winds, respond to the warmth of other suns and, perhaps, to bloom."}
{"original": "For many Black people in Georgia, part of the thrill of this week's victories is that they are finally seeing the political winds bend in their direction."}

{"original": "But Burton says Black voters in Georgia won't turn back now. They have a taste of national political power. Many are already gearing up for what they expect to be the next big contest: Abrams running for Georgia governor in 2022 in a potential rematch with Gov.

{"original": "What's next? Stacey in the governor's mansion, Burton says. We're not going to let up."}
{"original": "Burton and other Black voters will have plenty of company. As more Black Americans return to cities like Atlanta, they will continue to reshape politics in the South. They will join people like Burton who no longer need to go North, like their ancestors, to feel the warmth of other suns."}

{"original": "(CNN) President-elect Joe Biden on Friday outlined a plan to administer Covid-19 vaccines to the US population that includes opening up eligibility to get more people vaccinated, creating more vaccination sites and taking measures to increase the supply and distribution of the vaccines."}
{"original": "His plan includes mobilizing more personnel to support the vaccination effort, launching a public education campaign to address those hesitant to take the vaccine and focuses on ensuring equitable access to the vaccine across the country."}
{"original": "Our plan is as clear as it is bold: Get more people vaccinated for free. Create more places for them to get vaccinated. Mobilize more medical teams to get the shots in people's arms. Increase supply and get it out the door as soon as possible, Biden said during an event in Wilmington, Delaware."}
{"original": "Biden described the vaccine rollout in the United States under President Donald Trump as a dismal failure thus far."}
{"original": "If you were to ask most people today, they couldn't tell you who exactly is getting vaccinated. What they do know is there are tens of millions of doses of vaccine sitting unused in freezers around the country, while people who want and need the vaccine can't get it, Biden said."}
{"original": "The President-elect continued: We'll fix the problem by encouraging states to allow more people to get vaccinated beyond health care workers and move through those groups as quickly as they think we can."}
{"original": "Biden cautioned that things will get worse before they get better, and said that any policy changes implemented by his administration are going to take time to show up in the Covid statistics."}
{"original": "But the President-elect said he was convinced that his administration could meet his goal of administering 100 million vaccine shots in his first 100 days in office."}
{"original": "This is a time to set big goals to pursue them with courage and conviction, because the health of the nation is literally at stake, Biden said."}
{"original": "While Biden has set out ambitious goals for ramping up the supply of vaccine and the speed of vaccinations, he has offered few of the nitty-gritty details on how his administration intends to achieve them."}
{"original": "For instance, it's still unclear how Biden might use the Defense Production Act in a way that could ramp up vaccine supply, rather than the production of ancillary supplies like syringes."}
{"original": "His transition team has not provided a target number for federalized vaccination sites, except to say that thousands will be set up. And Biden's team has offered few details on how it plans to track states' progress to ensure Americans are being vaccinated at a pace that keeps up with Biden's goal of 100 million vaccine shots in 100 days."}
{"original": "A fact sheet provided by his transition team says Biden's plan encourages states to open up eligibility beyond healthcare workers and long-term care facility residents and staff, to include frontline essential workers like teachers, first responders, grocery store employees, and anyone who is 65 and older."}
{"original": "Health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities are the first in line for the coronavirus vaccines, as recommended by vaccine advisers to the CDC. Next in line are older adults, ages 75 and older, and frontline essential workers, including first responders, the advisers recommended."}
{"original": "The President-elect will use federal funds to create new community vaccination centers across the country and launch mobile vaccination clinics and provider partnerships to reach under-served urban areas and rural communities."}
{"original": "His plan will make vaccines available in pharmacies and increase the capacity at chain and independent pharmacies across the nation. As Biden has pledged in the past, he will use the Defense Production Act to maximize the manufacturing of the vaccine and increase the supply."}
{"original": "President-elect Biden's plan will release the vast majority of the vaccines when they are available, so more people can get vaccinated quickly, while still retaining a small reserve for any unforeseen shortages or delays, the fact sheet reads."}
{"original": "Biden will aim to release nearly every available dose of the coronavirus vaccine when he takes office, CNN previously reported . The Trump administration's strategy originally was to hold back half of US vaccine production to ensure second doses are available, but it has since reversed course and said it would distribute reserved second doses immediately, effectively adopting Biden's approach after disparaging it."}
{"original": "Biden's plan will increase the public health workforce to support the vaccination effort, which includes allowing for additional professionals to administer vaccines and encouraging states to expand the scope of practice laws and waive licensing requirements where appropriate. The President-elect will also mobilize a public health jobs program to support the response to the pandemic."}
{"original": "The President-elect's plan would reimburse state deployments of the National Guard to support vaccinations, and would provide a cost match for state and local emergency costs through the Federal Emergency Management Agency."}
{"original": "Biden has said his first priority when he takes office next week is to vaccinate Americans against the virus as the pandemic continues to devastate the nation."}
{"original": "The President-elect on Thursday outlined a $1.9 trillion emergency legislative package to fund his nationwide vaccination effort and provide direct economic relief to Americans who are struggling amid the coronavirus pandemic."}
{"original": "The American Rescue Plan calls for investing $20 billion in a national vaccination program, including launching community vaccination centers around the country and mobile units in difficult-to-reach areas. It would also increase federal support to vaccinate Medicaid enrollees."}
{"original": "The proposal also includes $1,400 stimulus checks, more aid for the unemployed, those facing food shortages and those facing eviction. It includes more money for child care and child tax credits, additional support for small businesses, state and local governments, and increased funding for vaccinations and testing."}
{"original": "The President-elect on Thursday did not detail how he plans to move this massive proposal through Congress, in which Democrats will have narrow House and Senate majorities, but both congressional Democratic leaders voiced support for the proposal and pledged to help turn it into law."}
{"original": "Biden's presidential transition team on Friday announced that Dr. David Kessler, a former head of the US Food and Drug Administration, would lead federal Covid-19 vaccine efforts for the incoming administration. Kessler will help lead Operation Warp Speed, the federal government's vaccine program that began under Trump, to speed up vaccine development and distribution."}
{"original": "The current Operation Warp Speed team under Trump has also encouraged states to broaden their vaccination guidelines beyond what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended. Only about 40% of doses of vaccine distributed have made it into people's arms, according to the latest CDC data released Friday."}
{"original": "More than 390,600 Americans have died from the virus as of Friday afternoon, according to Johns Hopkins University. On Friday, the CDC reported 31 million doses of vaccine have been distributed and 12 million doses have been given to people."}
{"original": "The President-elect has received both doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, and was administered both shots live on camera while reassuring the American public of its safety. He received the second dose earlier this week."}
{"original": "Vice President-elect Kamala Harris has received the first dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, and also did so on camera."}
{"original": "As Britain's political impasse sharpens ahead of its March 29 withdrawal date from the European Union, an idea has gained traction among some Brexiteers – that Britain should become a low tax, low regulation and low public spending paradise in the same mold of the tiny Southeast Asian city state of Singapore."}
{"original": "Singapore's admirers include Britain's most vociferous of Brexiteers, like Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Conservative MP Owen Paterson, and entrepreneur James Dyson. The Singapore model was lauded by Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt on his recent visit to the island nation, which is smaller in size than New York City. Britain can draw encouragement from how Singapore's separation from the Peninsula did not make it more insular but more open, he said during a news conference."}
{"original": "Even some Remainers are advocating for it. Former advertising guru Martin Sorrell told Sky News at Davos this week that Singapore's independence was not dissimilar to some of the things you hear around Brexit…[Singapore's founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew] took Singapore to a level that people never anticipated and made it extremely successful on a much smaller scale – 5 million people as opposed to 60 million people in Britain."}
{"original": "But the lessons are there, he added."}
{"original": "At face value, it is easy to see why. Singapore was among the world's poorest nations in 1965, when it became independent of Malaysia. Although it has limited natural resources, the country has become one of the world's most advanced, ranking higher in 2017 than the UK for GDP per capita (at $57,714 versus $39,720), according to the World Bank; and ranking near or at the top of global indexes for health efficiency, education and competitiveness – to name but a few."}
{"original": "PHOTO: ROSLAN RAHMAN/AFP/AFP/Getty Images The buildings of foreign multinationals loom high on Singapore's skyline."}
{"original": "While flattered by the new-found attention, Singaporean policy-makers seem baffled by the comparisons between two countries with wholly different demographics, population size, histories and regional locations."}
{"original": "The top tax rate for earners in the UK is 45%, compared to 22% in Singapore. Slashing tax, be it corporate or personal, in Britain will incur a number of knock-on effects to its state spending model, explained Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in an interview with Bloomberg's editor in chief at the New Economy Forum in November."}
{"original": "Britain has developed a system of state welfare, of government role in the system where the government accounts for 40 to 45 percent of the GDP, he said."}
{"original": "The Singapore government accounts for 16% of the GDP, maybe 17%. So to say that you're going to be like Singapore, are you going to give up two-thirds of your government spending, state pensions and national health?"}
{"original": "And Singapore's successes go much deeper than just a low tax rate. For foreign multinationals, whose buildings loom high on the country's skyline, the tax rate is one very small plank in a giant raft of attractive things about the country, Singaporean author, and Economist contributor, Sudhir Thomas Vadaketh told CNN."}
{"original": "Singapore straddles one of the busiest commercial shipping routes in the world. Its geographical location is what drew British colonialists to it in the 19th century. Two centuries on, it has become a major global maritime and financial hub; and an integral part of the Asian supply chain."}
{"original": "While the UK is also an important hub itself, what it lacks is Singapore's strategic advantage of drawing in companies and investment due to its strong rule of law in an otherwise unstable region. There are not many places in Southeast Asia that can offer that much stability and a well educated, working population, Vadaketh said."}
{"original": "Looking towards its neighbors has played a major part of Singapore's success, Kishore Mahbubani, Singapore's former ambassador to the UN and professor of public policy at the National University of Singapore, told CNN."}
{"original": "The country is one of the founding members of ASEAN, which is now a trading bloc of 10 member states, and no Singaporean government would contemplate [leaving ASEAN] because that would be suicidal, he said. The ASEAN ecosystem is very important for Singapore's economy and to leave a peaceful and prosperous neighborhood is not what you want to do."}
{"original": "The UK meanwhile will find it hard to compete against the EU, which, even amid the current populist surge, is arguably the world's most stable and largest economic bloc."}
{"original": "Singapore's small population size, of about 3.5 million Singaporean citizens, has led to a reliance on about 1.6 million foreign nationals (equating to close to 36% of the 5.6 million strong population). Something the British government will struggle to sell to the 17.4 million people, nearly 52% of those who voted to leave the EU, many of whom cited immigration concerns as their motivation."}
{"original": "Nor is Singapore some small-state nirvana. Its government has taken a highly interventionist approach to its economy, investing deeply in its nascent industries. Much of Singapore's land is nationalized and more than 80% of the population lives in well-built, state subsidized public housing that has ethnic quotas, which are rigidly enforced – something that will be hard to swallow in democratic polities. It has a level of intrusiveness that doesn't come comfortably to the liberal mind, Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam told the BBC in 2015."}
{"original": "But some say the high level of social cohesion in Singapore has come at a price for freedom of expression. Human Rights Watch has accused the government of curtailing political speech, launching defamation suits, enforcing draconian limits on public protest and prosecuting critics of Singapore's judiciary under the country's broad contempt of court law."}
{"original": "That approach has raised the hackles of Britain's opposition. Singapore is a country where basic freedoms of peaceful assembly, free speech and even sexuality are not respected but criminalized, and where the rule of law routinely means the brutal use of the cane, Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, told The Times of London."}
{"original": "The Singaporean government rejected this criticism in a statement to CNN. We fully respect the fundamental human rights enshrined in the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a spokesman for Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Those rights are achieved through our laws and judicial process which are internationally respected."}
{"original": "Singapore's constitution guarantees the right to freedom of speech and expression, but the spokesman said the right has constitutional restrictions. Given that Singapore is a multi-racial and multi-religious society, an individual's freedom of speech must be exercised with mutual respect and accord with the need to preserve a harmonious society."}
{"original": "Singapore's authoritarian-lite system has allowed its ruling party to stay in power since independence and see through long-term policies rather than the short-termism seen in democratic countries."}
{"original": "Why did the IBMs of the world come here very early on? Vadaketh said. Part of the reason is we offered them [multinationals] lots of transparency and tax incentives, but we also gave them clarity, Vadaketh added. Singapore said, 'hey, we are not going to have a change in government in five years… some nationalists are not going to come in and steal your assets.'"}
{"original": "But at the same time one could argue that the government has prevented reasonable and rational discourse in the public arena, which makes it not conducive for the kinds of jobs and industries they are trying to promote here – from basic start-ups to pharmaceutical research and development, he said."}
{"original": "That aside, companies are looking to Singapore as the technological center of gravity shifts to Asia. This week, Dyson's eponymous business, which makes vacuum cleaners and hair dryers, announced the relocation of its headquarters to Singapore."}
{"original": "For all the talk of Britain becoming the Singapore of the West, the proponents of that dream are choosing the real Singapore instead."}
{"original": "Chris Reining isn't your average retiree. He said goodbye to his working years at 37, and is now financially independent, living his life on his own terms."}
{"original": "Growing up in a middle-class family in Illinois, Reining says he did well in school, earned scholarships, and attended the school that paid him most. Unlike many other young people, he graduated with only $4,500 debt, which he quickly dispatched once he started working."}
{"original": "Eventually he found a well-paying job working in cyber-security, took out a mortgage and bought a condo, and financed a BMW."}
{"original": "But then he started to wonder: is this all there is?"}
{"original": "I finally said, 'I can't do this for 40 years,' recalls Reining."}
{"original": "In his late 20s, Reining started searching for alternatives. He read the book, Your Money or Your Life, by Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin. It helped me realize there's a way to arrange your life so you don't have to sit in this cubicle for 40 years and the idea of becoming financially independent became real."}
{"original": "By 35 he felt he had enough to live the rest of his life on his savings and investments without having to work again. It took two more years of showing up at the cubicle for him to be sure. Then, at 37, he finally walked away."}
{"original": "People who have reached financial independence can make it look easy."}
{"original": "But Reining is blunt about the prospects of making it to what he and others in the early retirement community call financial independence, retire early or FIRE."}
{"original": "It's not possible for everyone, he says. If you're tapped out by your expenses, it isn't realistic."}
{"original": "Also, he says, getting to FIRE isn't a sometimes thing."}
{"original": "It takes commitment, he said. The people who are most successful at it have compelling reasons for why they want it. The people who aren't going to get there, even though by the numbers they could, are the ones who don't have a compelling enough reason to make the hard decisions."}
{"original": "Related: How to retire early? Make the right moves for your age"}
{"original": "Retired for the past two years, Reining spends his time writing about financial independence on his website."}
{"original": "It does take a lot of small daily habits that you need to practice, day after day, Reining says."}
{"original": "Here are his strategies for how to earn more, save more and invest better en route to financial independence."}
{"original": "You've heard it all before about cutting back on dinners out and lattes."}
{"original": "But even with common sense rules about spending, many people succumb to lifestyle inflation, says Reining."}
{"original": "The more money you make, the more money you spend, and you'll save nothing, he says. Unless you establish a lifestyle level you want to maintain and remain there."}
{"original": "Where people get into trouble with saving is that they think they have to use reusable toilet paper and eat broth, says Reining. Be real. Basically, you'll never spend zero dollars. Find a level of living that you're comfortable with then work on earning more without increasing your expenses."}
{"original": "Your actual job is only part of your work. In order to earn the kind of money where you can live on only half or less of your salary (so you can sock the rest away) you need to focus on your career."}
{"original": "If you don't work on your career, says Reining, you're leaving money on the table."}
{"original": "This career boosting work can include earning advanced degrees or certifications that will qualify you for higher paying positions, raising your hand at every opportunity for a promotion or finding mentors."}
{"original": "It is important to understand your weak areas, says Reining. I found mentors, someone a few years ahead of me, who could be outside eyes and ears and help me see my options."}
{"original": "His mentors helped him be strategic in his career, which led to a more lucrative job doing consulting."}
{"original": "Side hustles, while readily available and hip right now, can be attractive for extra cash. But Reining suggests caution."}
{"original": "You have to think about the time spent and the money earned, he says. Is it better to spend time teaching yoga or walking a dog for $25 an hour or is that time better spent studying or networking so that you can get a $10,000 or $20,000 raise?"}
{"original": "And in the pursuit of a hot hustle, people often overlook the costs: I love doing yoga, but I'm not going to spend $4,000 to get a certification to teach it."}
{"original": "Many people already have one of the most powerful mechanisms for investment built right into their job: their employer sponsored 401(k)."}
{"original": "Contributing at the level where you get the employer match is a must, otherwise your walking away from free money, says Reining. But to get the biggest benefit, you'll need to contribute the maximum."}
{"original": "In 2018 the maximum contribution increased to $18,500, up from the $18,000 allowed in 2017. If you qualify, you may also be able to contribute to a Roth IRA, a retirement account for after-tax contributions up to $5,500. Both earnings on the account and withdrawals after age 59½ are tax-free."}
{"original": "Your investments don't have to be super complicated, they just need to grow. Reining's entire net worth is a 401(k), a taxable account, a condo and a checking account."}
{"original": "I like to keep it simple, says Reining. I have my 401(k) for when I'm in my 60's. It's just sitting there compounding for the next 20-some years. The rest of my money went into a taxable investment account."}

{"original": "It's hard to believe that Prince -- who was famously meticulous about maintaining control over his name and music -- may have died without a will."}
{"original": "That leaves open the question of who will inherit his millions, his record label and his unreleased songs."}
{"original": "So what happens to someone's estate if they didn't make their wishes known in writing?"}
{"original": "[A will] is your voice and lets you decide where things go and who you want to carry these things out, said David DuFault, an estate planning attorney at Sodoma Law in Charlotte, North Carolina."}
{"original": "If you die without one, you cede control to the state where you lived. Its laws will determine who your heirs will be and the state will choose the executor of your estate."}
{"original": "While inheritance laws differ from state to state, they generally favor spouses, registered domestic partners and blood relatives as heirs."}
{"original": "Unmarried partners, friends, and charities get nothing, according to legal guide publisher NOLO."}
{"original": "In Prince's case, he was divorced and he didn't have any surviving children. Plus, both his parents had already died. So under Minnesota law, unless someone finds a will or a trust that he created, his estate will go to his sister and his half-siblings."}
{"original": "Related: Special administrator appointed for Prince's estate"}
{"original": "There are, however, some assets that pass to people of your choosing even if you don't leave a will. If you had a life insurance policy with designated beneficiaries, those people will get those proceeds without state interference, DuFault noted. The same is usually true with your retirement accounts."}
{"original": "But if you don't designate beneficiaries, all proceeds will roll into your estate and be distributed according to state rules."}
{"original": "A will is also extremely important for parents, because it's the primary instrument by which you name the guardian of your minor children, and otherwise provide protections for them when you're gone, said estate planning attorney Jeffrey Molever of JUX law firm in Minneapolis."}
{"original": "Without a will, the court will appoint their guardian. The judge will gather as much information as possible about the children, their family circumstances, and the deceased parents' wishes and try to make a good decision. The primary rule is that the judge must always act in the best interests of the children, according to NOLO."}
{"original": "Still that doesn't mean the court will pick the person you would want to care for your kids."}
{"original": "The good news is most Americans will not be hit by the federal estate tax, since the first $5.45 million of an estate is exempt. The remainder would be taxed at rates up to 40%."}
{"original": "Related: Money essentials on wills and trusts"}
{"original": "But many states have their own estate tax. And typically their exemption levels are much lower than Uncle Sam's. In Minnesota, for instance, any estate worth more than $1.6 million this year will be taxed at rates as high as 16%."}
{"original": "Without a will, you could lose out on important tax benefits, such as the marital deduction, which lets your surviving spouse inherit your whole estate tax-free."}
{"original": "In North Carolina, for instance, if you die without a will, your estate will be divided by your spouse and your kids according to a state formula, DuFault said. That could subject portions of your estate to taxes."}
{"original": "So if you think you'll have a taxable estate, a will is especially important."}

{"original": "A prominent figure in France's gilets jaunes, or yellow vest, movement was seriously wounded during a protest in Paris on Saturday."}
{"original": "Jerome Rodrigues, a self-described pacifist, was injured in his right eye by a projectile hurled towards him, allegedly by police."}
{"original": "In an interview with French broadcaster LCI on Sunday, Rodrigues said that he had stayed in Paris' Place de la Bastille to encourage fellow yellow vest demonstrators to leave the area as skirmishes between the Black Bloc – another group of protesters often associated with anarchy and violent skirmishes – and the police, escalated."}
{"original": "Rodrigues' lawyer Philippe de Veulle told CNN affiliate BFM TV that he believes that a flash ball – a controversial less lethal hand-held weapon launcher deployed by French police in riots – injured him."}
{"original": "French police said the watchdog agency the General Inspectorate of National Police (IGPN) had launched an investigation into the case of an injured man rescued on Bastille Square."}
{"original": "Rodrigues's lawyer said he had evidence to give the IGPN."}
{"original": "I have material elements in the sense that it's a Flash Ball shot. The Flash Ball will be handed over to the IGPN Divisional Commissioner, who contacted my client's sister last night, de Veulle told BFM TV."}
{"original": "Flash Ball is a French-made trademarked projectile whose manufacturer, Verney-Carron Security, calls it a non-lethal 44mm-gauge weapon… versatile, adaptable, but always effective."}
{"original": "The incident was captured by Rodrigues, as he was livestreaming the protest, on his Facebook page. The video has been watched over 1.4M times and shared by 67,000 users."}
{"original": "Shortly after the incident, Rodrigues posted a photo to his Facebook account that said: I am going to lose my eye, fam."}
{"original": "The protests – named after the yellow high-visibility jackets French motorists must carry in their vehicles – started November 17 in reaction to an eco-tax on gas but have since morphed into broader demonstrations against President Emmanuel Macron and his government."}
{"original": "Last month, a pressurized Macron pledged to increase the minimum wage and get rid of new pension taxes. But the move has done little to appease the anger felt by some hard-core protesters."}
{"original": "Saturday marked the 11th consecutive week of the demonstrations. A French Interior Ministry spokesperson told CNN that approximately 69,000 people marched on Saturday in solidarity with the yellow vest movement, including 4,000 protesters in Paris."}
{"original": "I am a hyper pacifist, I do not want anyone to get hurt, Rodrigues said. I was there to make sure my little yellow guys could get out of this hell."}
{"original": "Rodrigues gave further details on the incident, saying that that he had been to the hospital and awaits further guidance from doctors regarding his injury."}
{"original": "It's very painful. I'm waiting for the doctors to come and tell me what it is. It's my right eye, and I think I stayed in the operating room for seven or eight hours, Rodrigues said."}
{"original": "Rodrigues is planning on filing a complaint to the police, LCI reported."}
{"original": "I was deliberately targeted. I am a figure of the movement, at least in the Paris protests, and police pointed their fingers at me many times during previous demonstrations, so I think they knew very well who they were shooting at, Rodrigues told BFM TV Sunday."}
{"original": "Ten people have died in connection with the protests, with most deaths taking place in traffic accidents related to blockades in November and December."}
{"original": "On Sunday, 10,500 people marched in the French capital for the so-called foulards rouges or red scarfs protest, in opposition to the ongoing yellow vest demonstrations, according to the Paris Police Department."}

{"original": "The market is creeping its way higher as it awaits increases in earnings estimates, said Sam Stovall, US equity strategist at CFRA Research, on the CNN Business digital live show Markets Now."}
{"original": "Besides earnings expectations, investors will also turn their attention to the possibility of another tax cut, Stovall said."}
{"original": "As stocks look for further gains in 2020, investors are keeping an eye on the presidential race. According to Stovall's research, if the S&P 500 rises between July 31 and October 31 in an election year, the incumbent candidate wins 80% of the time. If stocks fall, the incumbent loses 88% of the time. Investors don't like uncertainty, and a new regime injects uncertainty, he said."}
{"original": "Aside from the election, the major headwind for 2020 is the possibility that inflation starts to pick up as the economy improves, as unemployment remains really low, Stovall said."}
{"original": "That said, this week's inflation data, which was on the lower side, has assuaged these worries for now."}

{"original": "Our Committee is the primary investigative body in Congress, and we will address the issues that affect the American people every day while we root out waste, fraud, and abuse, Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings of Maryland said in a statement announcing the members."}

{"original": "Tlaib, the first Palestinian female member of Congress and one of two Muslim women members of Congress, drew attention recently for her comments the night of her swearing-in when she used an expletive to push for Trump's impeachment, a position she's stated repeatedly. More than a year before she ran for her seat, Tlaib was in the news when she was thrown out of an event in Michigan, where Trump was speaking after interrupting the then-Republican presidential nominee in protest."}
{"original": "Ocasio-Cortez is arguably the most famous member of the freshman class, and since her swearing-in has made a steady stream of headlines over her nascent career on Capitol Hill. Ocasio-Cortez has so far given lessons to her Democratic colleagues on how to use Twitter – one of her accounts has more than 2.5 million followers – as well as advocated for progressive policy goals, including a suggestion to tax the wealthy as high as 70% to fund a climate change plan. She's been a lightning rod for conservative critics, as well as irritating some in her own party."}

{"original": "The congressional testimony of President Donald Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen is already set to be one of the most highly anticipated moments of the new Democratic-controlled House, but those expecting significant public insights into the Russia investigation could be disappointed."}
{"original": "Cohen is not expected to answer questions about any topics related to that investigation when he appears before the House Oversight Committee next month because special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is ongoing. He consulted with the special counsel before agreeing to appear at the hearing, two sources told CNN."}
{"original": "That doesn't mean Cohen's testimony won't have dramatic reveals."}
{"original": "Cohen is prepared to discuss topics related to hush money payments and aspects of the Trump Organization, including the roles of the President and his children, according to a source familiar with the matter."}
{"original": "Cohen is willing to detail – if asked – then-candidate Trump's role in directing payments to two women who have claimed they had affairs with Trump and how his election played a role in that, according to the source. Trump has denied affairs with the women. Cohen may also talk about how he thinks his incarceration for tax evasion is unfair, the source said."}
{"original": "Cohen's testimony has raised questions about what he can say publicly given that the Mueller probe continues."}
{"original": "House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings said his staff has been consulting with Mueller about Cohen's appearance and will continue to do so ahead of his February 7 hearing."}
{"original": "We will not interfere with the Mueller investigation, the Maryland Democrat said Friday. Those discussions (with the special counsel) may very well go on until the day before … because Mueller is ongoing."}
{"original": "Cohen is appearing before Congress next month after he pleaded guilty in December to multiple charges and was sentenced to three years in prison. Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance crimes that included payments during the campaign to silence the women alleging affairs – crimes that prosecutors say Trump directed Cohen to commit. Trump has denied he directed Cohen to make the payments."}
{"original": "Cohen also pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about how long the proposed Trump Tower Moscow project discussions extended into the 2016 campaign when he testified before the congressional intelligence committees in 2017."}
{"original": "It's not yet clear what specific topics might be off limits. Cummings declined to say, for example, whether Cohen would be allowed to talk about Trump Tower Moscow."}
{"original": "Asked if hush money payments would be part of the hearing, Cummings said his committee was in search of the truth."}
{"original": "The American people will have an opportunity to hear from him, Mr. Cohen, Cummings said. And their representatives, that is representatives on the Republican side and the Democratic side, will have an opportunity to ask him questions, and I think the American people would see that it did matter, their votes did matter, and we opened it up for transparency."}
{"original": "One Democratic member of the panel cautioned fellow Democrats not to give Republicans what they want – turning the hearing into a circus by asking intimate questions about Trump's alleged affairs."}
{"original": "Cohen's testimony before the oversight panel is public, so he won't talk about the Russia investigation there, but he could have those discussions with Congress behind closed doors before other panels. Both the House and Senate intelligence panels are seeking to bring back Cohen before he reports to prison in March."}
{"original": "It's my understanding that he doesn't intend to address the Russia investigation in his open testimony. He is going to need to answer questions about it and we're in contact with the attorney, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff of California told CNN on Thursday. We hope that he will come in voluntarily to testify before the Intel Committee in closed session."}
{"original": "According to a source familiar with the matter, Cohen has not yet committed to testify to either of the intelligence committees."}
{"original": "Even if Mueller does not want Cohen answering questions that touch on the Russia investigation, that doesn't mean they won't be asked at his public hearing. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the oversight committee, didn't rule out pressing Cohen on questions related to any topic."}
{"original": "It seems to me if he comes in there, we should be able to ask him about whatever we want to ask him about, Jordan said Friday."}
{"original": "On Friday, Jordan sent a letter to Cummings asking him to include Republican staffers in discussions with Cohen's lawyers and Mueller's team about Cohen's testimony. Jordan also asked Cummings to seek a host of records from the Justice Department and the FBI about Cohen, including notes of their interviews with Cohen, investigative reports and cooperation agreements."}
{"original": "I hope you will work with me and the minority members to avoid an unproductive and chaotic hearing, Jordan wrote. If you are going to provide a platform for this convicted felon and perjurer, we ought to ensure we have the necessary information to prepare to question him."}
{"original": "Jordan was frequently frustrated when Republicans were investigating FBI and Justice Department conduct in 2016 that his questions about the origins of the Russia investigation and a foreign intelligence surveillance warrant were rebuffed by DOJ lawyers."}
{"original": "I've tried to ask all kinds of questions in every one of these depositions and I've had like 15 lawyers sitting in there telling the witness they couldn't answer the question, he said."}
{"original": "For a year and a half (the Democrats) said we don't want to do anything to disrupt the Mueller investigation, but we're going to bring in their star witness before the Mueller investigation is done."}
{"original": "Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the House Freedom Caucus chairman and a close GOP ally of Trump on the oversight panel, hinted at the acrimony Cohen should expect from the Republican questioners."}
{"original": "I think it's strange that the very first big hearing, the witness is a convicted felon who's going to prison because he lied to Congress, Meadows said."}
{"original": "Cohen could use his willingness to testify as a way to appeal for a more reduced sentence, though there is no agreement with prosecutors to consider that. He is due to start his three-year sentence on March 6."}

{"original": "In just a couple of months' time, those three females and four other ponies were euthanized after a fungus-like disease produced ghastly lesions and other problems that proved too difficult to defeat. The last were put down near the end of December."}
{"original": "The losses have wounded a community fascinated and inspired by the famous wild Chincoteague ponies, which have grazed on a Virginia barrier island for centuries. No one's sure how they got there: Legend and a famous children's book suggest they survived shipwrecks; others say settlers loosed them on Assateague Island to feed."}
{"original": "The Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company, which manages the herd, brought in veterinarians to combat the disease, sometimes called swamp cancer."}
{"original": "Supporters are pinning their long-term hopes on a prevention vaccine under development, along with enhanced treatment for ponies in the grips of the infection."}
{"original": "PHOTO: courtesy Amanda Geci Shadow, right, with Rainbow Warrior. Shadow was euthanized in the last days of 2018."}
{"original": "The real secret is catching it early, said Darcy Cole, a photographer who spends 300 days a year studying the creatures. She spotted a few of the ill ponies and notified caregivers."}
{"original": "While observers say the herd of about 150 wild ponies appears now to be healthy, there is concern of a re-emergence of the infection next summer, when warmer temperatures return."}
{"original": "Outside of saving lives and properties these ponies are our No. 1 priority, said Denise Bowden, spokeswoman for the fire company. We are animal lovers, too."}
{"original": "The herd is a huge tourist draw and likenesses of them are ubiquitous on Chincoteague Island; sports teams for the high school are called the Ponies."}
{"original": "The animals roam Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge on Assateague Island, just across the channel from Chincoteague Island."}
{"original": "Amanda Geci, an Alabama resident who owns a Chincoteague pony, keeps a searchable pedigree database. She remembers seeing Essie, then a baby, during a visit."}
{"original": "The losses of the seven ponies and a few others in previous years are heartbreaking."}
{"original": "'By then, it is too late'"}
{"original": "According to reports, sores on a few ponies' legs were first noticed a couple of years ago."}
{"original": "Veterinarians determined they were suffering from pythiosis, a disease that traditionally has been associated with Latin America and Gulf states in the United States."}
{"original": "The organism typically grows on dead or dying grass and plants and is present near water, said Dr. Richard Hansen, a researcher whose Oklahoma company is doing work on a vaccine and enhanced immunotherapy to combat the infection."}
{"original": "Zoospores are attracted to a ponies' hair or cuts. It's attracted to a wound, maybe even a tiny one."}
{"original": "From there, the disease can create lesions and it compromises the animal's immune system."}
{"original": "Local veterinarians assisted the fire company in treating the infected animals. Pony supporters said doctors and fire company volunteers did all they could – using a variety of treatments, including immunotherapy – to save the animals."}
{"original": "Dr. George Marble of Eastern Shore Animal Hospital said he tried an antifungal treatment, and for a while it seemed the ponies were improving. But the pythiosis came back with a vengeance, he said."}
{"original": "PHOTO: Matt McClain/The Washington Post/Getty Images Wild ponies stand at the water's edge last month on Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge."}
{"original": "I think the efforts need to be in prevention, said Dr. Allison Dotzel, a large-animal veterinarian. It is a notoriously difficult disease to treat."}
{"original": "Hansen's company at some point will seek approval from the US Department of Agriculture to experimentally use a product to quell this outbreak."}
{"original": "Making a rapid diagnosis is crucial for the animal's survival, experts say. But that can be a challenge."}
{"original": "I might see one today and they may go into the woods, Bowden said. You may not see them for two weeks. By then, it is too late."}
{"original": "Ponies are on the top of the chain on this island"}
{"original": "PHOTO: Mark Wilson/Getty Images/FILE Every July, wild ponies swim across a channel from Assateague to Chincoteague, where foals are sold."}
{"original": "You may recognize Chincoteague ponies from the famous five-minute swim they make every July."}
{"original": "About 35,000 visitors see the entire herd (minus newborns and pregnant mares) paddle the channel that separates the islands. Many more tourists come during the year to see the horses, shop or stay in motels on Chincoteague Island."}
{"original": "Long known as a fishing village, Chincoteague Island became synonymous with the ponies after the book Misty of Chincoteague and a later movie. One-hundred and fifty head of ponies control the purse strings of the entire island, said Bowden."}
{"original": "We call it the 'Misty' mystique, said Kendy Allen, who has owned about 100 of the breed over the years and operates the Chincoteague Pony Drill Team. Allen, who calls Chincoteague ponies a unique breed, said the animals are very smart. When domesticated, they can be used for all disciplines of riding, including jumping."}
{"original": "The volunteer fire company annually auctions off numerous foals – typically for about $3,800 – to raise money for firefighting equipment and costs. Our citizens do not pay a fire tax, said Bowden."}
{"original": "Allen said prospective buyers should understand their pet is not like a puppy or kitten; the foals are young and were not touched by humans before the July swim. They are used to drinking from the ground. When you take one home, you need to put the bucket on the ground."}
{"original": "Dotzel, a veterinarian in north-central Pennsylvania, bought Finn at a 2015 auction. He likes to be challenged. He is not lazy at all. I think that is part of the breed. She is trying to get him accustomed to a saddle."}
{"original": "PHOTO: courtesy Allison Dotzel Allison Dotzel of Pennsylvania says her pony, Finn, is very inquisitive."}
{"original": "Dotzel said there are online and other resources to help owners with training and care."}
{"original": "The fire company also chooses six to eight foals each year to serve as buybacks, a form of sponsorship that allows the bidder to buy and name the animal before it is returned to Assateague Island."}
{"original": "There's another reason for the auction: controlling the pony population on Assateague."}
{"original": "The ponies owned by the volunteer fire company are on the Virginia portion of the island. Animals on the Maryland side are on land managed by a different federal agency. Birth control darts have been used there to control their numbers. A barrier keeps the two populations apart. It's not known whether any of the 80 estimated ponies on the Maryland side have become ill."}
{"original": "The Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Department deworms, vaccinates and checks the teeth and hooves of its herd."}
{"original": "For now, there's hope that the disease can be effectively treated should it reappear. We know we need to be more vigilant on every part of this in the coming year, said Bowden. Hansen said he expects his immunotherapy products will complement other treatments."}
{"original": "Cole, who makes regular trips to Assateague Island, likes to check in on the 15 bands that make up the herd. Each family has about 10 ponies and their own grazing territory. They are a sight to behold."}
{"original": "They are an American treasure, Cole said."}

{"original": "If your car is getting old -- I mean more than eight years old -- now is a good time to unload it."}
{"original": "While there are plenty of relatively new pre-owned cars on the market, auto dealers and their less well-heeled customers are having a hard time finding more affordable used cars."}
{"original": "So prices that dealers are willing to pay for older cars and SUVs are rising."}
{"original": "The reasons are two-fold. For one thing, people are keeping their older cars and SUVs even when they buy a new one, said Ivan Drury, an industry analyst with the automotive Web site Edmunds.com. That's thanks to an improving economy and cars that are more reliable."}
{"original": "Related: GM's Bolt EV ready to take on Tesla"}
{"original": "Additionally, there's a particularly low supply of vehicles about eight or nine years old because, starting in 2008, the United States suffered an historic recession that crushed new car sales, said Larry Dixon, a used car market analyst with J.D. Power and Associates."}
{"original": "Fewer new cars sales back then means there are fewer used cars to sell now."}
{"original": "There's is also a short term bump in demand for used cars around this time every year, said Dixon. This is when folks start to get their tax refunds and many of them put that money toward a new -- for them, at least -- used car."}
{"original": "The average price paid for a used car went up 3.4% between 2015 and last year, according to data from Edmunds.com, a trend that has been fairly consistent since the recession."}
{"original": "But, during that same year, prices for 9-year-old used cars rose 8.4%. Increases are even sharper for SUVs and crossovers around that age."}
{"original": "The real opportunity for car dealers lies in vehicles that are in good condition that can be sold for less for less that $10,000, said Rob Smith, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-area Fitzgerald Auto Mall dealer group."}
{"original": "I have 165 cars in that range to divide up among 15 stores, he said. That's not enough."}
{"original": "Even older cars that can sell for around $5,000 are particularly desirable, Smith said. Vehicles like that never stay on his used car lots for long because there are always customers who just want something -- almost anything -- they can drive."}
{"original": "Related: I rented a guy's $145,000 Tesla Model X"}

{"original": "The upshot: If you have an older car in good shape you should expect to hear from your neighborhood car dealer."}
{"original": "He'll want to buy your car because he probably already has customers looking for something just like it."}
{"original": "Particularly if it's well-maintained, if it's been cared for and the mileage is reasonable, said Dixon, Those are the type of vehicles dealers will pay top dollar for."}

{"original": "(CNN) Some of the most sweeping and ambitious bail reform legislation in New York state history became codified into law on the first of the year. Criminal justice activists predictably hailed the massive restructuring of the cash bail system -- which was designed to level the playing field for accused who are bail-eligible but may not possess the financial means to secure it."}
{"original": "But the reformed laws prohibit judges from setting a cash bail requirement for a lengthy list of misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies -- to include stalking assaults that do not result in serious injury and even certain incidents related to arson and robbery. Early returns are now in, providing numerous examples -- not abstractions -- of dangerous unintended consequences."}
{"original": "The actual architect of bail-reform initiatives may have been the tragic case of Kalief Browder, who was arrested when he was 16 in 2010 for allegedly stealing a backpack, and subsequently remanded to Rikers Island. A prior vehicle-theft conviction as a minor, along with his indigent family's inability to immediately produce the $900 necessary for bond, resulted in his incomprehensible pretrial detention of three years -- before the charges were ultimately dismissed for lack of evidence. Browder, the subject of a Netflix documentary, struggled to assimilate upon returning home, following long months of solitary confinement and brutalization by some prison guards and fellow inmates. He tragically took his own life on June 6, 2015. He was 22."}
{"original": "Browder's case became a cause célèbre for bail reform efforts , as it encapsulated the issue of cash bail's fundamental unfairness. Wealthy defendants -- who could also pose potential threats to society -- were positioned to essentially buy pretrial release unavailable to those of lesser means. But caution should be urged when considering reflexive overhauls that could be due to outliers -- extreme cases with complex causalities -- which may not be reflective of the system as a whole."}
{"original": "The legitimate concern over the lessons of the Browder case unfortunately devolved into a sweeping change that is far too permissive and dangerous to society."}
{"original": "New York's bail-reform initiative essentially restricts judges and magistrates; limiting discernment and judgment from the bench. A USA Today Network New York survey of the state's 62 counties revealed that the new law would result in an immediate release of 3,800 people held in county jails."}
{"original": "Republican lawmakers and police organizations have ominously warned about the effects of essentially emptying the jails of accused misdemeanor offenders during the pretrial process, as some may continue to pose a danger to the community. The president of the New York City Police Department Patrolmen's Benevolent Association (NYC PBA), Patrick Lynch, told me that [t]he stories of dangerous criminals being released to reoffend are not 'malfunctions' of the new system -- they are the new system working as designed."}
{"original": "Former NYPD and LAPD Commissioner Bill Bratton professed strong condemnation for the reforms referring to them in a radio interview as  a disgrace."}
{"original": "Some view this as overwrought law enforcement scare tactics. PolitiFact elected to fact-check one of the NYC PBA's more ominous warnings: Defendants charged with producing, directing or promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child will be arraigned & set free. The claim rated mostly true, with noted allowances for limited instances whereby bail may be set."}
{"original": "Released January 1 with an appearance ticket for interfering with his court-ordered ignition interlock device, Jordan Randolph already had three prior DWI convictions before his latest alleged drunken-driving episode led to a fatal crash on Sunday that killed Jonathan Flores-Maldonado, a recent SUNY-Buffalo graduate. Maldonado's stepfather, Phillip Beyernheimer, said [w]e just identified him and his remains, so that he can be released to be cremated and that's all because of a bail reform law, according to CBS2."}
{"original": "As New York state grapples with recent spate of anti-Semitic hate crimes attacks on Orthodox Jews, a Brooklyn woman who was arrested for allegedly slapping three Orthodox women, was released, and then arrested the very next day for allegedly assaulting yet another person. The judge in the case acknowledged that she had to comply with the coming bail reform legislation, and freed Harris in advance of the laws' enactment, saying ...I'm releasing her on consent and also because it will be required under the statute in just a few days."}
{"original": "In Albany, a man originally charged with second degree manslaughter -- no longer an offense that is eligible for bail -- was released earlier this month. Days later, after more evidence was analyzed, he was indicted on a second-degree murder charge for the same death. He has pleaded not guilty to murder charges and was remanded to jail on Wednesday."}
{"original": "In Seneca County, a 34-year-old man was arrested during the law's initial first days on charges of predatory sex assault, rape in the first degree, and endangering the welfare of a child, according to a Seneca County Sheriff's Office press release. The victim was under the age of 13. The press release said the man's release with supervised electronic home monitoring was in compliance with the new bail reform laws as the least restrictive non-monetary condition imposed by the court."}
{"original": "In the wake of these incidents, the man who signed the bail reform legislation into law, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, acknowledged the laws needed to be revisited"}
{"original": "James Skoufis, a Democratic state senator representing New York's 39th district since 2019, voted for the bail reform law, but has publicly acknowledged the laws' frailties. He has become an outspoken advocate for amending the law, attempting to build a coalition in the state senate to debate a complicated amendment to address some of the glitches. When I asked him why he had been a signatory to a bill so obviously fraught with inadequacies, Skoufis highlighted one of the major impediments to voting clean, single-item bills in legislative bodies: The vote [was] more complicated. There was no up or down vote on bail reform. It was in an enormous budget bill. In the same bill was all school funding, the property tax cap, STAR [New York State School Tax Relief Program], and lots and lots of other stuff. If the bill was voted down, government would've effectively shut down."}
{"original": "Skoufis highlights the stark choices lawmakers face when voting on omnibus legislation. Any opportunity to push back on obvious areas of concern related to bail reform would have crippled the operating effectiveness of innumerable areas of state and local governments in New York."}
{"original": "There is no doubt that rational reforms should have been a priority in Albany -- and around the nation, as well. But there needs to be additional consultation with police, prosecutors and judges on these alarming results. Consideration needs be given to afford judicial discretion, as applied to each individual case before the bench -- bereft of blanket mandates that leave judges helpless but to comply with some risky restrictions."}

{"original": "But can tweaking the flawed laws make a difference? Rafael A. Mangual, the deputy director of legal policy at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, argued in an op-ed that New Jersey has enacted similar reforms, but with a bit more prudence. He highlighted one important distinction where prosecutors in New Jersey can move to revoke a defendant's release if that defendant is rearrested for a new offense, or if he fails to appear in court. Garden State judges granted more than 1,000 such motions in 2018. But even while crediting New Jersey for a more effective reformation, Mangual notes it remains less than ideal, acknowledging that [t]he most recent report issued by the state's judiciary shows a not-insignificant increase in the percentage of defendants charged with new offenses while awaiting trial."}
{"original": "Recent criminal justice reform efforts have appeared to enjoy bipartisan agreement. In our current fractious nation, could it be possible to envision a bipartisan consensus amongst lawmakers regarding the immediate need to reform the reforms? The new laws are just over two weeks old. We don't need any additional head-scratching -- or fatal -- examples to make the case."}
{"original": "New York Governor Andrew Cuomo says the federal government just lobbed an economic missile at New York by limiting tax filers' state and local tax deduction."}
{"original": "And he urged the state's lawmakers Tuesday to take action now to avoid it."}
{"original": "Change our tax code in a way that thwarts that attack, Cuomo said Tuesday in his 2018 budget address."}
{"original": "The purpose of the attack, in his view, is to subsidize the trillions in tax cuts contained in the new federal tax overhaul passed in December."}
{"original": "Cuomo noted that New York already sends $48 billion more every year to the federal government than the state gets back. Capping the SALT deduction at $10,000 will add another $14 billion to that, his office estimates."}
{"original": "But, Cuomo said, two structural changes to New York's tax code might mitigate the impact of the cap on New York taxpayers. The governor's office estimates the SALT cap will increase New York middle class families' property and state income tax burden by 20% to 25%."}
{"original": "Cuomo has directed his Department of Taxation and Finance to outline options for creating a state payroll tax to replace the income tax on wages."}
{"original": "The payroll tax would be paid by employers based on the wages they pay their workers. And the employers may still deduct those payroll taxes on their federal return."}
{"original": "Employees, meanwhile, would not pay any state tax directly on their wages. Instead, their wages likely would be a bit lower to reflect the cost of the new tax to their employer."}
{"original": "Cuomo explained it this way: Say you paid $5 to the state in income taxes for every $100 you earned last year. Under the new system, that $5 would be paid by your employer. But your income likely would be $5 less as a result. You'd still end up with the same $95 either way. And your employer's costs would still be $100 but your company could deduct the $5, since the payroll tax is a deductible employer expense."}
{"original": "At the end of the transaction, it costs business nothing and the employee is held harmless from ... the loss of (state and local tax) deductibility, Cuomo said."}
{"original": "He acknowledged such a switch would be dramatic as well as complicated, since the state also would maintain its income tax for non-wage income."}
{"original": "But the idea of a new payroll tax may not sit well with all businesses."}
{"original": "One upstate business advocacy group worries that it could create more administrative burden and higher costs for employers."}
{"original": "Simply shifting New York's ever-increasing tax burden onto employers -- rather than reducing state spending or reforming property taxes -- will likely exacerbate New York's already well-established economic challenges and population decline, said Greg Biryla, executive director of Unshackle Upstate."}
{"original": "Offer state tax credits for charitable contributions"}
{"original": "To help offset the limitation on people's property tax deductions at the federal level, Cuomo has also asked his tax department to outline options to let New York state residents make a charitable contribution to the state through local government funds that might help finance education or health programs."}
{"original": "In exchange for the charitable contribution, the state would issue the resident a tax credit, although it's not likely to be dollar for dollar, Cuomo said. In addition the resident could deduct his charitable contribution on his federal tax return, since the new federal tax law does not curb charitable deductions."}
{"original": "A similar proposal has already been introduced in California, which is another high-tax state worried about the SALT deduction cap's impact on its residents."}
{"original": "More details on both proposals are expected later this week when the New York Department of Taxation and Finance is expected to put out its preliminary report."}

Eventually, the IRS wants its cut -- and it's best either to be prepared for the consequences or to take steps early on to avoid the problem in the first place."}
{"original": "Millions of Americans have tax time bombs lurking among their assets. Often, it's a smart strategy to put these investments to good use, as long as you don't forget about their potential downsides."}
{"original": "Here are three of the most common tax time bombs that you'll find and what you can do to keep them from doing irreparable damage to your finances."}
{"original": "1. Traditional IRAs and qualified retirement plan accounts"}
{"original": "Perhaps the largest ticking time bomb from a tax perspective comes from the money that Americans have in IRAs, 401(k) plans, and other qualified retirement plans. 401(k)s have about $5.3 trillion in assets, according to the Investment Company Institute, and total retirement assets amount to $27.2 trillion. That second number includes annuities and traditional pensions, and both figures consist of both traditional and Roth-style IRAs and 401(k) plans. Nevertheless, it's fair to assume that there's somewhere between $10 trillion and $20 trillion in pre-tax assets held in retirement plans."}
{"original": "The problem with traditional IRAs, 401(k)s, and similar retirement accounts is that when you withdraw money from them, you have to pay income tax on what you pull out, and that reduces the size of your effective after-tax nest egg."}
{"original": "Even if you don't want to withdraw your pre-tax retirement money, these accounts are almost universally subject to required minimum distribution rules that kick in at age 70 1/2. Once you reach that age, you have no choice: You must start withdrawing a portion of your account and paying taxes on it."}
{"original": "What's more, the withdrawals you have to include in taxable income can subject other sources of income to tax. The most common example is Social Security, where benefits become taxable if your outside income lifts you over certain threshold amounts."}
{"original": "One solution is to make greater use of Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k) plan options. Roth accounts let you save after-tax money, with distributions being tax-free in retirement. Not all employers offer Roth 401(k)s, but conversions of existing traditional retirement assets to Roths are generally available."}
{"original": "Many people own savings bonds without even knowing it. As popular gifts from older generations to children, savings bonds differ from most bonds in that they accumulate interest on a tax-deferred basis. You don't have to pay taxes on the income that they generate each year."}
{"original": "The price you'll pay, though, is that you have to pay tax when you cash in your bonds. Because currently issued savings bonds stop earning interest after 30 years, you either have to cash them in and suffer the tax consequences or allow them to sit without earning any interest at all after their final maturity date."}
{"original": "Fortunately, one solution is to take the money from maturing bonds and transfer it into a 529 college savings plan account. Doing so lets you exclude the accumulated interest from taxation. Otherwise, you'll have to pay tax on the entire increase in value from what you paid for the bond and what you received when you cashed it in."}
{"original": "Finally, your personal residence can be a ticking tax time bomb. Most homeowners get the benefit of one of the most lucrative tax breaks on the books: the capital gains exclusion of up to $250,000 for singles or $500,000 for joint filers. What that means is that if a couple saw their home rise in value from $300,000 to $800,000 over their lifetimes, they can sell it and pay no tax at all."}
{"original": "So how is this a tax trap? The potential problem is that the exclusion is available only for property that's been used as your principal residence during at least two of the five years preceding the sale. There are special rules that reduce that requirement to just one year if you need to leave your home for long-term care in a nursing home or other institution, but failing to meet the requirement can eliminate the exclusion entirely. Moreover, if you decide to change the nature of the home to a nonqualified use -- such as renting it out -- then capital gain that's attributed to the period of nonqualified use can be taxable."}
{"original": "The solution is to sell your home long before there's any danger of losing the personal residence exclusion. Otherwise, you could turn the most profitable investment of your life into a major tax hassle."}

{"original": "Where should I go to college? Where should I work?"}
{"original": "Instinctively, these questions are answered with the name of a dream college or well-liked company. But the geographic dimension — the where? — often depends on a person's financial situation and ability to relocate."}
{"original": "The overwhelming majority of public four-year college students currently attend a school within 100 miles of home — and more than half stay within 50 miles, according to our research at The Hamilton Project."}
{"original": "In other words, for most students, the decision of where to go to college is determined largely by where they live."}
{"original": "But for many others, attending college nearby is simply not an option: There are no two- or four-year degree-granting institutions in as many as 58% of US counties, our research found. Limited college access is an issue that impacts students from a wide variety of backgrounds, including those from both rural and urban communities."}
{"original": "Related: This college tax credit saved the typical American family $2,277"}
{"original": "America's financial aid system is designed to help students pay for the direct costs of college, including commuting costs. But the costs of a long distance move often exceed the direct moving and travel expenses that aid helps cover. For students in counties without local college access, this may mean the difference between attending college or not."}
{"original": "Another potential barrier arises when students prepare to graduate from college and ask, Where should I work?"}
{"original": "Unfortunately, the financial burden of both relocation and student loan debt can interfere with a graduate's ability to start their careers off right. Graduates need to begin paying off student loans immediately, and thus may feel pressured to take the first job that comes along."}
{"original": "They may settle for easy-to-get jobs near their university or in a well-known big city, rather than seek their best career match somewhere else."}
{"original": "Previous generations of young adults were much more likely to move for career opportunities. Among 20- to 24- year-olds, moves across state or county lines declined from 16% in 1965 to about 8% in 2016, according to our research."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, employment and earnings opportunities continue to diverge across US localities. For example, labor force participation in rural counties has fallen sharply since the recession, while it has been flat or modestly falling in metropolitan counties."}
{"original": "Related: College tuition is still getting more expensive"}
{"original": "But cities with more educated workers have been growing faster and paying higher wages for decades. This has contributed to a rising concentration of skilled workers in larger cities."}
{"original": "Combined, these factors mean that recent college graduates face a more difficult path to finding a first job that is best for them."}
{"original": "In order to level the playing field for all students, we need to remove geographic barriers to college access and careers."}
{"original": "One solution is to create large supplements to the Pell Grant to help students without local college access."}
{"original": "An annual supplement of up to $5,000 for students from counties without a degree-granting college within their borders could help these students afford the high cost of relocating, according to our policy research."}
{"original": "Another strategy is to offer an automatic, full-year student loan grace period for graduating college students if they are working or seeking work in a job market outside of their commuting zone or county."}
{"original": "Related: When does it make financial sense to get a graduate degree?"}
{"original": "Deferring loan repayment for students who choose to start their post-college careers after relocating would allow them to seek opportunities in distant job markets, alleviating the pressure to start quickly earning income to meet their repayment obligations."}
{"original": "Given that greater mobility when graduating from college can help workers improve their early career job matches, this is critical for achieving higher lifetime earnings."}
{"original": "College attendance plays an incredibly important role in increasing lifetime earnings, and early career conditions can have persistent effects on those earnings."}

{"original": "(CNN) President-elect Joe Biden is inheriting a national crisis that has built up over 40 years. On January 20, 1981, former President Ronald Reagan took the US on a radical course when he declared in his inaugural address , In the present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. He set out to weaken the federal government by slashing taxes on the rich, dismantling regulations , cutting back on public programs and turning many of the nation's problems back to the states."}
{"original": "President Donald Trump continued this approach -- passing massive tax cuts in 2017, and then when calamity hit with Covid-19 in 2020, placing the burden of response on the states. It is Biden's historic task to reverse Reagan's -- and Trump's -- reckless radicalism."}
{"original": "Reagan won the presidency in 1980, in part, because of two actions by Democratic presidents that had brought an end to the national consensus in favor of activist government that began with Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal of the 1930s and lasted through the 1960s."}
{"original": "The first action that ended the consensus was profoundly moral. Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson both backed the Civil Rights Movement's call to dismantle America's racist policies, including the segregation of housing, schools and places of public accommodation, and the systemic denial of voting rights to African Americans, which had prevailed since the end of Reconstruction. They did so in the face of intense opposition by segregationist Southern Democrats -- and knowing that their actions could split their own party."}
{"original": "The result was a furious backlash of White working-class voters that swept Richard Nixon into office in 1968 with the help of the  Southern Strategy,  a new Republican strategy to court disgruntled Southern White voters. These White voters thereafter strongly supported politicians like Nixon and Reagan who promised to cutback the enforcement powers of the federal government and stop federal programs on jobs, housing and community development that would undermine continued segregation at the local level."}
{"original": "The Path to Recovery The Path to Recovery, a new CNN Opinion series, aims to help readers understand the nation's economic crisis that has been building for decades and the role that the federal government should play in solving it."}
{"original": "The second action was profoundly immoral. Johnson escalated the Vietnam War even though he knew the war was conducted on the basis of lies and deception . Johnson's decision was also politically disastrous because the war spending ramped up inflation and bitterly divided the nation. During his first term, Nixon further escalated the war and the inflation and unleashed years of monetary instability that lasted through the presidency of Jimmy Carter. When inflation reach 13.5% in 1980, Carter was defeated by Reagan in November that year."}
{"original": "Reagan claimed that he wanted to stop deficit spending, but his 1981 tax cuts increased the deficits (from 2.5% of GDP in 1981 to 5.9% of GDP in 1983), as did the 2001 tax cut under former President George W. Bush and the 2017 tax cut under Trump. Over time, the various tax cuts were not matched by offsetting spending cuts, since broad areas of federal spending were -- and continue to be -- very strongly backed by the public. In fact, according to the Pew Research Center, in 2019, there were strong majorities supporting increased government spending on many domestic priorities, including education, infrastructure and the environment."}
{"original": "The result has been a massive buildup of federal government debt, which was also stoked by the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. The federal debt owed to the public was 25% of GDP when Reagan took office. It was around 98% of GDP at the end of 2020, and will likely soar further because of further urgent spending related to Covid-19."}
{"original": "The bottom line is that the US has very low taxation as a share of GDP (in fact, the lowest among all high-income countries in the OECD except Ireland), insufficient public services, decrepit infrastructure, and massive debts and deficits -- all at the same time!"}
{"original": "The states are not able to step in by providing more local services and infrastructure neglected by the federal government. States compete with each other by slashing taxes to attract investments away from other states. Only the federal government has the power to raise adequate tax revenues to meet the public's needs for healthcare, education, job training, research and development, infrastructure and other needs."}
{"original": "As the federal debt has grown -- and many states have struggled -- one part of American society has laughed all the way to the bank. The wealthy funders of both parties -- Wall Street financiers, big oilmen, Silicon Valley gurus, real estate developers, private-prison owners, etc. -- couldn't believe their good fortunes in receiving repeated tax breaks and even the deregulation of their polluting activities. The rich got richer year after year, while working class Whites and African Americans, social conservatives and social liberals, evangelicals and atheists, waged the pitched battle for the nation's soul."}
{"original": "Reagan's failed radicalism has now run its course, and the United States, while culturally as divided as ever, is at an economic and environmental precipice. Real hourly wages for the median male worker (at the 50th percentile of the earnings distribution) fell 3% between 1979 and 2019. Student debts are $1.68 trillion , owed by an astounding 44.7 million borrowers. And climate change has plunged the nation into crises of mega-forest fires, coastal flooding, extreme storms, droughts and heatwaves. The year 2020 tied for the world's warmest on record, an astounding 1.25° Celsius above the pre-industrial temperature -- with worse to come."}
{"original": "Even during the Covid-19 pandemic, the rich have gotten much richer. Over 150 of the richest Americans , who number among the world's richest 500 people, now have a combined wealth of $3 trillion, which is up by over $600 billion from the start of 2020. With Covid-19, the very richest Americans hit the jackpot, with their wealth soaring as the result of Federal Reserve liquidity, huge budget outlays and their ownership of the digital platform monopolies on which much of the economy now operates."}
{"original": "The Biden administration must now find a recovery path out of the wreckage of four decades of Reagan radicalism and the politics it created. Reagan got us stuck on the ideas that government is the problem, cuts in federal tax cuts are necessary, environmental regulations are problematic and major national problems can be left to the states and cities. These ideas, alas, are wrong, even though they are widely believed and were politically convenient for those who disliked the federal government's policies to end racial segregation."}

{"original": "But the real test will come when Democrats, suddenly backed by a narrow majority in the US Senate, push raising corporate tax rates and introduce new regulation."}
{"original": "Companies that have raced to the sidelines may feel compelled to turn the spigots back on to influence major legislation that impacts their bottom lines. And that may include donating to some Republicans who objected to the Electoral College votes but also object to higher taxes and more red tape."}
{"original": "Corporate executives are genuinely appalled. Last week changed everything, said Greg Valliere, chief US policy strategist at AGF Investments. Many business leaders felt a need to shame the Republicans who refused to accept the election results."}
{"original": "Valliere predicted that Republican Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, who led the Senate effort to overturn the election, will be pariahs for the rest of their careers."}
{"original": "However, the debate is likely to shift later this year to how to pay for the trillions of dollars of new spending Biden is proposing to repair the US economy. And that may include a modest increase in the corporate tax rate -- a step that would eat into corporate profits and share prices."}

{"original": "We are waiting to see what we can do, waiting for what the President tells us, he said. There is no work."}

{"original": "(CNN) Donald Trump's presidency has largely been defined by his disregard for political norms and his historic two impeachments ."}
{"original": "Trump purposefully sought to upend conventional domestic and foreign policy, fundamentally altering America's role in the world. And he disrupted the status quo in Washington, recalibrating the federal government's role in everyday American life in ways both temporary and for a longer term effect."}
{"original": "Some of Trump's most consequential decisions, such as his judicial appointments , will dictate the ideological make-up of the courts for decades. And the physical reminder of his immigration and border security policies, in the form of a US-Mexico border wall, will likely remain etched into America's landscape well past his presidency."}
{"original": "Other actions, including many issued through the use of executive authority, can be undone through the regulatory process or with the flick of Joe Biden's pen once he's president. Still, those actions will have sometimes had a years long impact on American lives, affecting everything from their jobs to their schools to the kinds of lightbulbs they can buy."}
{"original": "Here are some of the most significant ways Trump's policies and actions changed the country:"}
{"original": "Medical personnel move a deceased patient to a refrigerated truck serving as make shift morgues at Brooklyn Hospital Center on April 9, 2020 in New York City."}
{"original": "The federal response to the coronavirus pandemic was the Trump administration's biggest focus during the President's final year in office -- and its biggest failure."}
{"original": "Trump made apparent political calculations that put optics ahead of the health of Americans. He held large rallies in the final months of the election filled with throngs of unmasked crowds as the pandemic was hitting a new peak, he declined to wear a mask or social distance in front of cameras and he publicly downplayed the seriousness of the virus while privately knowing its deadliness"}
{"original": "The US currently boasts more coronavirus cases and deaths than any other country."}
{"original": "The one victory was the quick development of two coronavirus vaccines that were authorized by December. But the rest of the handling on the pandemic was defined by major, and at times arguably fatal, missteps."}
{"original": "There's no good, specific treatment for coronavirus infection and the US efforts to help speed development of new approaches was middle by an early emphasis on drugs that were proven to be completely useless, notably hydroxychloroquine"}
{"original": "Prior to the pandemic, the opioid crisis was Trump's top public health focus. The President declared a public health emergency over the issue and signed Congressional legislation into law that increased funding for the epidemic."}
{"original": "However, the efforts have had mixed results."}
{"original": "Drug overdose deaths fell slightly in 2018, but there has been a substantial increase in fatal drug overdoses coinciding with the Covid-19 pandemic."}
{"original": "A US Border Patrol officer stands near artwork installed on the Mexican side of the border near Tecate, California."}
{"original": "Trump's immigration policies were always going to be central to his presidency, ever since he announced his candidacy and declared that migrants coming into the US from Mexico were rapists and criminals."}
{"original": "The administration rolled out hundreds of executive actions curtailing both legal and illegal immigration to the United States, starting with one of his first actions as President: the travel ban, which has been derided by critics as an attempt to ban Muslims from the US."}
{"original": "After many legal battles, including some instances where the ban was blocked by courts, the Supreme Court upheld an iteration of the ban in 2018."}
{"original": "Some of the Trump administration's restrictive immigration efforts have been blocked by courts, including an attempt to include an immigration question in the census and end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program."}
{"original": "The Trump administration also separated thousands of families at the US-Mexico border under the controversial zero-tolerance policy and built hundreds of new barriers on the border. Refugee admissions to the US plummeted. And in a pair of White House immigration moves this past spring, the administration suspended much of family-based immigration and a number of guest worker visas through the end of the year, with some exceptions, citing high unemployment caused by the coronavirus pandemic."}
{"original": "On Day 1 of his presidency, Biden is expected to quickly issue executive actions undoing Trump's past immigration orders, reinstating DACA and repealing the travel ban. But ultimately, the administration overhauled the US immigration system to largely bar immigrants from the US through successive changes that will be difficult for Biden to undo."}
{"original": "Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on March 12, 2020."}
{"original": "Though Trump has largely leaned on stock market gains, boosted take-home pay and record low unemployment as major highlights of his presidency, his full record on the economy is mixed at best. Many those economic achievements dissipated when the coronavirus hit."}
{"original": "Nearly 8 million more Americans have joined the ranks of the poor since June , according to researchers from the University of Chicago and University of Notre Dame. The poverty rate jumped to 11.7% in November, up from 9.3% in June. That's nearly double the largest annual increase in poverty since the 1960s. The rise in the poverty rate has most dramatically increased among Black Americans, the research indicates."}
{"original": "And he will have overseen smaller growth in economic output than any of the previous 12 presidents."}
{"original": "The Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have reached record highs during the Trump presidency, even as unemployment increased due to Covid-19, but those market gains have largely been driven by low interest rates set by the Fed."}
{"original": "And while Trump can boast a higher-than-average 3.32% annual gain in real per capita disposable income, that average conceals the extent of those gains that flowed to the affluent, who benefited disproportionately from his tax cuts."}
{"original": "Trump speaks before signing the USMCA on January 29, 2020."}
{"original": "Trump cast himself as a businessman-turned-politician that would not allow the US to be taken advantage of by the rest of the world. That nationalist mindset manifested itself in several ways, but especially on trade -- impacting the cost of goods from around the world and altering the US labor market."}
{"original": "cheese, wine and whiskey. Trump exited the Trans-Pacific Partnership during his first month in office. His administration waged a steel and aluminum tariff war against key US trading partners, causing prices of many products made with the metals to rise. His administration also threatened to issue and, sometimes, followed through with tariffs against a range of European products -- including cars"}
{"original": "His administration renegotiated the NAFTA agreement with Canada and Mexico, renaming it USMCA. The administration also struck a trade agreement with China, but after phase one of the deal was agreed upon earlier this year, relations with China were put on ice, largely due to fallout from the coronavirus pandemic."}
{"original": "The reasoning behind much of Trump's trade moves, he and his allies asserted, was to bring back jobs from overseas. But tacking on tariffs, relaxing economic regulations and lowering taxes could have a limited effect on the repatriation of job opportunities for Americans lost to cheaper labor abroad, and foreign direct investment in the US declined significantly during the first two years of Trump's tenure."}
{"original": "The President seemed to acknowledge that his trade war hurt farmers, and that to offset their struggles, he celebrated the implementation of subsidizing tactics that ran counter to the anti-socialist principles he said he believes in."}
{"original": "The pandemic set off new crises for the industry, including damage to supply chains. Farm bankruptcies before and during the pandemic soared."}
{"original": "Despite Trump's efforts to repatriate US companies' production to the US, American auto plants closed . And in 2020, major US car companies shifted into survival mode because new car sales entered a steep decline and production halted."}
{"original": "The judiciary and the Justice Department"}
{"original": "Trump applauds Judge Amy Coney Barrett after she was sworn in as a US Supreme Court Associate Justice."}
{"original": "Of all the President's policy legacies, his judiciary appointments promise to be the most enduring: He successfully appointed hundreds of federal judges and three Supreme Court justices, ensuring a strong conservative influence for decades."}
{"original": "But Trump's approach to the Justice Department, a federal agency traditionally understood to work independently from the President, can best be understood by the fact that he has said he sees himself as the country's chief law enforcement officer. Still, he's made history as the first US president to be impeached twice."}
{"original": "Throughout his presidency, Trump was vocal about his distrust of the Justice Department and fundamentally misunderstood its mission."}
{"original": "He refused to accept losing the 2020 presidential election for months, directing a storm of Trump campaign lawsuits that largely failed in court and fomenting so much distrust in the democratic process among his supporters that it led to deadly violence at the US Capitol."}
{"original": "Trump fired FBI Director James Comey and publicly railed against his successor, Chris Wray . He fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions and late last year, his successor, Trump loyalist Bill Barr, resigned less than two months before the end of the presidential term after publicly splitting with the President on several high-profile issues."}
{"original": "And the President essentially adopted a pardoning policy that put his friends, former associates and individuals with connections to the administration before other formal petitioners."}
{"original": "The Trump administration announced in July 2019 that it was reinstating the federal death penalty. Thirteen federal death row inmates have been executed in the six months since it has been reinstated."}
{"original": "Trump faced an arguably unprecedented mountain of lawsuits challenging his policies, his business practices and his own personal behavior. Many of those legal fights will follow him once he's out of office."}
{"original": "Trump holds up the Federal Commission on School Safety report while Betsy DeVos, U.S. secretary of education, right, listens."}
{"original": "Trump's efforts around education largely revolved around school choice and symbolic efforts appealing to culture war issues."}
{"original": "The administration had a few small-term successes on school choice, including the increase in annual fund for charter expansion and allowing 529 savings plans to be used for K-12 education. Adding to those victories, Trump also signed legislation passed in Congress that secured Historically Black Colleges and Universities with permanent funding."}
{"original": "In the wake of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Florida in 2018, Trump established a school safety commission that led to the rescinding of Obama-era guidance meant to address racial disparities in how students are disciplined. Two years after the shooting, the commission rolled out SchoolSafety.gov, a federal clearinghouse of information to help schools. Trump and the White House also proposed arming teachers."}
{"original": "On another culture war front, the administration also withdrew Obama-era protections for transgender students in public schools. And in his final year in office, as Black Americans protested police brutality in widespread protests, Trump issued a salvo against attempts to more accurately portray racism and slavery in school history including creating the 1776 Commission to promote patriotic education. But with Trump's presidency coming to an end, it's unlikely to have an impact on future US curriculums."}
{"original": "The bathroom guidance and executive orders can easily be reversed by Biden."}
{"original": "The buildings of downtown Los Angeles are partially obscured at midday on November 5, 2019."}
{"original": "Trump announced in his first year in office that he intended to exit the Paris Climate Agreement. He said during the announcement, which was aimed at curbing climate change, that the accord placed draconian financial burdens on the American people. It's one of many instances of Trump exiting an international agreement where he felt the US was treated unfairly."}
{"original": "Biden has said he plans to have the US rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on his first day in office. The US is about halfway toward achieving the accord's goal to cut emissions, but not on track to meet it, according to the New York Times."}
{"original": "Besides Trump's decision to pull out of the accord, the Trump administration's record on energy and the environment was largely headlined by efforts to roll back a slew of environmental protections in favor of perceived economic opportunity. Much like Trump reversed many of Obama's environmental policy achieved through executive order, Biden is expected to do much the same of Trump's."}
{"original": "The Republican's administration targeted 50-year-old Clean Air Act protections, carbon emissions caps, methane regulations, energy efficient light bulb requirements, the length of environmental impact studies for infrastructure projects and gas pipelines, animal protections, herbicide limits and limits for auto emissions."}
{"original": "They've downsized major protected lands and proposed allowing logging in the nation's largest national forest. In Trump's final year in office, the administration has pushed forward regulatory changes that would remove penalties for killing birds, loosen water efficiency standards for showerheads, and loosen energy conservation standards for washers and dryers."}
{"original": "The President has frequently touted that the US has the cleanest air and cleanest water in the world, but the US ranks 16th in air quality in the world and the US ranks 26th in quality of sanitation and drinking water, according to the Environmental Performance Index."}
{"original": "However, one analysis shows that after rising sharply in 2018, US greenhouse gas emissions reversed course and dropped an estimated 2.1% in 2019. But that drop is largely due to drops in coal power generation -- an industry the Trump administration has attempted to revive."}

{"original": "This photo, released by the Iraqi Prime Minister Press Office, shows a burning vehicle at the Baghdad International Airport following the US airstrike that killed Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force, on January 3."}
{"original": "Trump's defense strategy was headlined by efforts to push the US to exit foreign wars. And his foreign affairs strategy was dominated by his belief that the US was being taken advantage of by other nations, including allies."}
{"original": "He approached foreign relations much like his businesses, leaning on loyalists outside official diplomatic and military channels to push his most controversial efforts while insisting that he alone had the deal making prowess to deliver wins with dictators such as Kim Jong Un. Still, those efforts consistently fell short."}
{"original": "Germany, Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq. While Trump was in office, the United States withdrew troops from Syria"}
{"original": "The US and the Taliban signed a historic agreement setting into motion the potential full withdrawal of US forces in Afghanistan."}
{"original": "Trump increasingly isolated Iran, pulling the US out of the Iran Nuclear Deal and ordering the killing of top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani."}
{"original": "His administration brokered Middle East peace agreements and moved the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem."}
{"original": "The administration also put many of President Barack Obama's attempts to warm relations with Cuba on ice, with the US recently naming the country a state sponsor of terrorism . His administration also targeted Nicolas Maduro's regime in Venezuela."}
{"original": "Despite his repeated calls for the US not to serve as the world's policemen, he also successfully sought increases to military spending. And when Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act into law in 2019, he created the the newest military service and the first new service since the US Air Force came into being in 1947 -- the United States Space Force. His administration also repeatedly attempted to slash foreign aid."}
{"original": "He also went over the heads of military commanders to institute controversial policies, blindsiding the US Joint Chiefs when he announced via Twitter that he would institute a blanket ban prohibiting transgender people from serving in the military. The ban went into effect in 2019, prohibiting transgender people from joining the military. It's likely to be reversed by the Biden administration."}
{"original": "Another hallmark of his foreign policy was his approach to Russia -- namely, his hesitation to single out Russian aggression and, at times, embrace its leader, Vladimir Putin, against his allies' and advisers' warnings."}
{"original": "He declined to condemn Putin or his government over their role in foreign election interference and spreading misinformation, hacking federal agencies, the poisoning of dissidents, and the reported bounties on the heads of US troops in Afghanistan."}
{"original": "Protesters hold signs and shout at lawmakers walking out of the US Capitol."}
{"original": "Trump's health care efforts were largely motivated by attempting to undo his predecessor's landmark law -- the Affordable Care Act. He also implemented a slew of regulations aimed at appeasing his evangelical base, such as religious freedom objections. In apparent efforts to appeal to seniors and his longtime nationalist focus -- fighting for the US not to get ripped off -- he also pursued policies aimed at price transparency and matching the prescription costs in other countries."}
{"original": "The Trump administration did many things to weaken Obamacare -- including cutting the open enrollment period in half to six weeks, slashing the advertising budget by 90% and severely cutting funding for enrollment assistance. Also in 2017, the President eliminated federal payments that help reduce deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for low-income participants, prompting insurers to raise premiums to cover the loss of these cost-sharing subsidies."}
{"original": "Sign-ups on the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, slipped in the first three years of the Trump administration before rising amid the pandemic in 2020. After the President's tumultuous first year in office, premiums edged down for three years straight and the number of participating insurers grew."}
{"original": "Most notably, the administration is supporting a coalition of Republican-led attorneys general who are seeking to overturn the landmark health reform law. They argue that Congress' reducing the penalty for not having insurance to zero invalidated the individual mandate, and the entire law must fall. The challenge is currently before the Supreme Court"}
{"original": "The Trump administration released a 44-page blueprint of how the President would reduce drug prices in 2018, but few of the measures have taken effect or made a dent in prices. Some were blocked by courts, including his recent rule to tie Medicare's reimbursement of certain drugs to their cost in other countries and an attempt a few years ago to require drug makers to include list prices in television ads."}
{"original": "The Trump administration also waged a multi-front battle looking to chip away at abortion access throughout the President's tenure."}
{"original": "In 2019, the administration introduced a rule barring federally funded health care providers in the Title X family planning program, which provides taxpayer funds to health clinics that offer sexual health services, from referring patients for abortions."}
{"original": "Trump reinstated and expanded the so-called Mexico City Policy , a ban on funding for foreign nonprofits that perform or promote abortions, during his tenure."}
{"original": "The Trump administration also reversed a directive which ordered that states cannot bar Medicaid funds from going to qualified providers that separately provide abortions, such as Planned Parenthood"}
{"original": "Trump frequently celebrated signing a Right to Try bill passed by Congress into law, which was aimed at helping terminally ill patients access drug treatments that have not been fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration."}
{"original": "People wait in their cars for the San Antonio Food Bank to begin distributing food on April 9, 2020."}
{"original": "The Trump administration sought to remove millions of people from public assistance programs over the last four years, but in many cases, these efforts failed to be finalized before the end of the President's tenure or failed to hold up in court."}
{"original": "Prior to the pandemic, Trump saw poverty decline during his time in office, but as the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic have continued to ravage the US, hunger and poverty have surged."}
{"original": "In 2019, the US Department of Agriculture proposed three rules that could strip an estimated 3.7 million people of their food stamp benefits."}
{"original": "Like its efforts with food stamps, the Trump administration in 2018 also began allowing states to institute work requirements in their Medicaid programs , but federal courts struck down several of the approvals. The Supreme Court agreed last month to review the issue."}
{"original": "Separately, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently granted Tennessee's request to turn its federal Medicaid funding arrangement into a so-called modified block grant. It is the first state to receive such permission to receive a lump sum of federal support in exchange for increased flexibility in administering its Medicaid program and an opportunity to share in any savings with the federal government."}
{"original": "The Department of Housing and Urban Development also sought to strip protections for transgender Americans seeking housing in federally funded homeless shelters. The department argued that the change would better accommodate religious beliefs of shelter providers, as well as other practical concerns, but it came during the coronavirus pandemic, worrying advocates who feared that it could leave some transgender Americans without housing in the middle of a public health crisis. The rule has yet to be finalized and Biden will likely seek to keep the existing rule in place."}

{"original": "Thousands of people with misdemeanor marijuana possession convictions will be pardoned in Washington state, Gov. Jay Inslee said."}
{"original": "Washington voters approved legalizing marijuana as a tax revenue measure in 2012. Initiative 502 legalized and regulated the production, possession and distribution of cannabis for people ages 21 and older."}
{"original": "Now, Inslee has announced the Marijuana Justice Initiative, a plan to expedite record clearances for thousands of citizens who were convicted of small-time possession charges before the law came into effect. About 3,500 people could be pardoned by the Marijuana Justice Initiative, according to the governor's office."}
{"original": "Inslee said he hopes the change will alleviate undue burden on those previously convicted."}
{"original": "We shouldn't be punishing people for something that is no longer illegal in Washington state, Inslee said. Forgiving these convictions can help lessen their impact and allow people to move on with their lives. It's a small step, but one that moves us in the direction of correcting these injustices."}
{"original": "These misdemeanor convictions can be over a decade old, but still create barriers to housing, employment, student loans, credit scores and even the ability to participate in a child or grandchild's school field trip."}
{"original": "Carrying around misdemeanors for something that is no longer considered illegal is unfair, and they disproportionately affect communities of color the governor said."}
{"original": "Only people with a single conviction on their record will be eligible for the pardon, according to the statement. That person must also have been convicted between January 1, 1998 and December 5, 2012 for misdemeanor marijuana possession as an adult. That prosecution must have occurred under state law in Washington."}
{"original": "Those who have an adult misdemeanor marijuana possession and believe they qualify for a pardon can submit a petition online, the statement said. Once the Office of the Governor reviews the case and confirms they are eligible, Inslee will pardon the conviction and ask Washington State Patrol to remove the offense from the criminal history report that is available to the public."}

{"original": "(CNN) The Treasury Department is cooperating with a Senate Republican investigation into Hunter Biden's activities in Ukraine, according to a top Democrat on one of the committees."}
{"original": "Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, criticized the Treasury Department for sending over information after it had stonewalled the House's impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine."}
{"original": "Wyden's office is not saying what documents were turned over and whether they specifically involve Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden. Three Republican chairmen -- Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina -- have sent letters in recent months seeking information and interviews related to the Bidens, the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma and uncorroborated allegations about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election. Trump and his allies have repeatedly made unfounded and false claims to allege that the Bidens acted corruptly in Ukraine."}
{"original": "For its part, the Trump administration refused to comply with all Democratic requests for documents and witnesses associated with impeachment. Applying a blatant double standard, Trump administration agencies like the Treasury Department are rapidly complying with Senate Republican requests -- no subpoenas necessary -- and producing 'evidence' of questionable origin, Wyden spokeswoman Ashley Schapitl said in a statement. The administration told House Democrats to go pound sand when their oversight authority was mandatory while voluntarily cooperating with the Senate Republicans' sideshow at lightning speed."}
{"original": "A Treasury spokesman did not respond to a request for comment."}
{"original": "Grassley spokesman Taylor Foy said, As a matter of routine, we don't discuss sensitive third-party material during ongoing investigations. It's unfortunate that Democrats whom we've kept in the loop on our investigations would recklessly seek to interfere with legitimate government oversight."}
{"original": "The Senate Republican investigation into the Bidens, which is being led primarily by Grassley and Johnson, is a sign that while impeachment has ended, the investigations related to Ukraine have not. House Democrats too are still pursuing probes and court cases post-impeachment, and many Democrats want the House to subpoena former national security adviser John Bolton, who was not called in the Senate trial, after senators voted not to hear from witnesses."}
{"original": "It is not clear what Treasury has provided to the Senate committees, which was first reported by Yahoo News . Grassley and Johnson sent a letter dated November 15, 2019 to the director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Ken Blanco, requesting information related to their investigation into potentially improper actions by the Obama administration with respect to Burisma Holdings and Ukraine. Johnson and Grassley requested all Suspicious Activity Reports -- which financial institutions are required to file when they spot suspicious activity, though the reports don't necessarily indicate wrongdoing occurred -- that were filed related to 11 individuals or entities including Hunter Biden and Burisma Holdings by December 5, 2019."}
{"original": "In addition to the Treasury letter, the Senate Republicans chairmen requested information late last year related to Ukraine from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General William Barr. In a sign they are still expanding their probe, they sent a new letter on Wednesday to the Secret Service seeking travel information on Hunter Biden."}
{"original": "During the impeachment trial, Trump's lawyers and congressional Republicans defended the President's actions by saying he had legitimate reasons to worry about corruption Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, the latter of whom who worked for Burisma. Multiple witnesses in the impeachment inquiry testified that Biden's actions in Ukraine were consistent with official US government policy, backed by European allies and both Republicans and Democrats in Congress, including Johnson."}
{"original": "In the House, Democrats are still weighing their next steps following the end of the Senate impeachment trial. They never received documents from the Trump administration related to Ukraine, some of which have been released in the weeks since the President was impeached in December thanks to Freedom of Information Act lawsuits. There's also the question of Bolton, who indicated he was willing to testify in the Senate but has not said the same about the House."}
{"original": "House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, said Wednesday that it was likely the House would subpoena Bolton, but House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff has not committed to doing so. We really haven't made any decisions yet, the California Democrat said Thursday when asked about the House's next steps."}
{"original": "In addition to Ukraine threads, House Democrats still have active court cases in their efforts to obtain the President's tax returns , financial and accounting information and the testimony of former White House counsel Don McGahn . Democrats said they expect those investigations into the President to continue, regardless of having already impeached him -- and the committees will continue aggressive oversight of the federal agencies."}
{"original": "No one thinks that the Senate's act of jury nullification gives the President any immunity from the Congress' oversight power, said Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat on the Oversight and Judiciary committees. So we will not let up for one second in ferreting out the corruption and the criminality that have overtaken the administration. I believe our oversight power is as necessary as ever, if not more so now. This President appears to be emboldened by the robotic behavior of Republican senators with the notable exception of Mitt Romney."}
{"original": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday noted the ongoing court cases but didn't suggest the Democrats were about to make a new push for testimony from Bolton or others."}

{"original": "When I think of the word unity, I think of Queen Latifah bellowing U-N-I-T-YYYYY, in a sing-songy tone with a touch of Newark twang. When I think of unity, I think about the way Black women endearingly call each other sis, and how Black men greet each other by throwing a nod from across the way. However, one thing that notably does not come to mind is a vision of our 50 states."}
{"original": "In the spirit of truth, honesty, and fairness -- principles inherently foreign to a country that could declare all men are created equal while stealing indigenous land and trading slaves -- a brief walk down memory lane will show you that my view of unity as antithetical to America is not truly my fault; it's America's. Growing up Black in this country, you learn from an early age just how divided these United States actually are."}
{"original": "You see, I was still in elementary school, pledging my allegiance to our flag each morning, when I first heard the divisive N-word used as a racial slur. In middle school, when I was taught about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his admirable dream for a unified America through non-violence, I had already been educated outside of school about his broader legacy and the activism that made him a target. So, when white teachers, on the verge of tears, hailed him a hero after reading a few cherry-picked quotes, it wasn't lost on me that it was the government of these purported United States who relentlessly surveilled him and a White man in these United States who murdered him"}

{"original": "Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow citizens:"}
{"original": "Three years ago, we launched the great American comeback. Tonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results. Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again! America's enemies are on the run, America's fortunes are on the rise, and America's future is blazing bright."}
{"original": "The years of economic decay are over. The days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us. Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige."}
{"original": "In just 3 short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline, and we have rejected the downsizing of America's destiny. We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never going back!"}
{"original": "I am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been. Our military is completely rebuilt, with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world -- and it is not even close. Our borders are secure. Our families are flourishing. Our values are renewed. Our pride is restored. And for all these reasons, I say to the people of our great country, and to the Members of Congress before me: The State of our Union is stronger than ever before!"}
{"original": "The vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world's most prosperous and inclusive society -- one where every citizen can join in America's unparalleled success, and where every community can take part in America's extraordinary rise."}
{"original": "From the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the United States economy -- slashing a record number of job-killing regulations, enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements. Our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth, and, most of all, pro-American. We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting high our citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed."}
{"original": "Since my election, we have created 7 million new jobs -- 5 million more than Government experts projected during the previous administration."}
{"original": "The unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century."}
{"original": "Incredibly, the average unemployment rate under my Administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country. If we had not reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witness to America's great economic success."}
{"original": "The unemployment rates for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans have reached the lowest levels in history. African-American youth unemployment has reached an all-time low."}
{"original": "African-American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded."}
{"original": "The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years -- and last year, women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added."}
{"original": "The veterans' unemployment rate dropped to a record low."}
{"original": "The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low."}
{"original": "Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in United States history."}
{"original": "A record number of young Americans are now employed."}
{"original": "Under the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls. Under my Administration, 7 million Americans have come off of food stamps, and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare."}
{"original": "In 8 years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age people dropped out of the workforce. In just 3 years of my Administration, 3.5 million working-age people have joined the workforce."}
{"original": "Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage-earners has increased by 47 percent -- 3 times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent. After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast -- and, wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers, who have seen a 16 percent pay-increase since my election. This is a blue collar boom."}
{"original": "Real median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded!"}
{"original": "Since my election, United States stock markets have soared 70 percent, adding more than $12 trillion to our Nation's wealth, transcending anything anyone believed was possible -- this, as other countries are not doing well. Consumer confidence has reached amazing new heights."}
{"original": "All of those millions of people with 401(k)s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60, 70, 80, 90, and even 100 percent."}
{"original": "Jobs and investment are pouring into 9,000 previously-neglected neighborhoods thanks to Opportunity Zones, a plan spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott as part of our great Republican tax cuts. In other words, wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that have not seen investment in many decades, creating jobs, energy, and excitement. This is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this. It is all working!"}
{"original": "Opportunity Zones are helping Americans like Army Veteran Tony Rankins from Cincinnati, Ohio. After struggling with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, his house, and his family -- he was homeless. But then Tony found a construction company that invests in Opportunity Zones. He is now a top tradesman, drug-free, reunited with his family, and he is here tonight. Tony: Keep up the great work."}
{"original": "Our roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start. This second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark Criminal Justice Reform into law. Everybody said that Criminal Justice Reform could not be done, but I got it done, and the people in this room got it done."}
{"original": "Thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world, by far. With the tremendous progress we have made over the past 3 years, America is now energy independent, and energy jobs, like so many elements of our country, are at a record high. We are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just 3 years ago."}
{"original": "Likewise, we are restoring our Nation's manufacturing might, even though predictions were that this could never be done. After losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my Administration with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or built. We have created over half a million new manufacturing jobs. Companies are not leaving; they are coming back. Everybody wants to be where the action is, and the United States of America is, indeed, where the action is."}
{"original": "One of the single biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal. In fact, unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for President. Following NAFTA's adoption, our Nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs. Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA -- only to do absolutely nothing. But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises. Six days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed the brand new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law."}
{"original": "The USMCA will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs, and massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers. It will also bring trade with Mexico and Canada to a much higher degree, but also to a much greater level of fairness and reciprocity. This is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America's labor unions."}
{"original": "I also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China's massive theft of American jobs. Our strategy worked. Days ago, we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions of dollars into our treasury, and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the United States of America. For decades, China has taken advantage of the United States, now we have changed that but, at the same time, we have perhaps the best relationship we have ever had with China, including with President Xi. They respect what we have done because, quite frankly, they could never believe what they were able to get away with year after year, decade after decade, without someone in our country stepping up and saying: Enough. Now, we want to rebuild our country, and that is what we are doing."}
{"original": "As we restore American leadership throughout the world, we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere. That is why my Administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba. We are supporting the hopes of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans to restore democracy. The United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people. But Maduro's grip of tyranny will be smashed and broken. Here this evening is a man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans. Joining us in the gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó. Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland. All Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom! Socialism destroys nations. But always remember, freedom unifies the soul."}
{"original": "To safeguard American Liberty, we have invested a record-breaking $2.2 trillion in the United States Military. We have purchased the finest planes, missiles, rockets, ships, and every other form of military equipment -- all made in the United States of America. We are also finally getting our allies to help pay their fair share. I have raised contributions from the other NATO members by more than $400 billion, and the number of allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled."}
{"original": "And just weeks ago, for the first time since President Truman established the Air Force more than 70 years earlier, we created a new branch of the United States Armed Forces, the Space Force."}
{"original": "In the gallery tonight, we have one of the Space Force's youngest potential recruits: 13-year-old Iain Lanphier, an eighth grader from Arizona. Iain has always dreamed of going to space. He was first in his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy. He aspires to go to the Air Force Academy, and then, he has his eye on the Space Force. As Iain says, most people look up at space, I want to look down on the world."}
{"original": "Sitting beside Iain tonight is his great hero. Charles McGee was born in Cleveland, Ohio, one century ago. Charles is one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen -- the first black fighter pilots -- and he also happens to be Iain's great-grandfather. After more than 130 combat missions in World War II, he came back to a country still struggling for Civil Rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam. On December 7th, Charles celebrated his 100th birthday. A few weeks ago, I signed a bill promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General. And earlier today, I pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office. General McGee: Our Nation salutes you."}
{"original": "From the pilgrims to our Founders, from the soldiers at Valley Forge to the marchers at Selma, and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Americans have always rejected limits on our children's future."}
{"original": "Members of Congress, we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people. The people are the heart of our country, their dreams are the soul of our country, and their love is what powers and sustains our country. We must always remember that our job is to put America first!"}
{"original": "The next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. Yet, for too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools. To rescue these students, 18 States have created school choice in the form of Opportunity Scholarships. The programs are so popular, that tens of thousands of students remain on waiting lists. One of those students is Janiyah Davis, a fourth grader from Philadelphia. Janiyah's mom Stephanie is a single parent. She would do anything to give her daughter a better future. But last year, that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania's Governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice for 50,000 children."}
{"original": "Janiyah and Stephanie are in the gallery this evening. But there is more to their story. Janiyah, I am pleased to inform you that your long wait is over. I can proudly announce tonight that an Opportunity Scholarship has become available, it is going to you, and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice!"}
{"original": "Now, I call on the Congress to give 1 million American children the same opportunity Janiyah has just received. Pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act -- because no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school."}
{"original": "Every young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and grow. For this reason, our magnificent First Lady has launched the Be Best initiative -- to advance a safe, healthy, supportive, and drug-free life for the next generation, online, in school, and in our communities. Thank you, Melania, for your extraordinary love and profound care for America's children."}
{"original": "My Administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background. Through our Pledge to American Workers, over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million Americans."}
{"original": "My Budget also contains an exciting vision for our Nation's high schools. Tonight, I ask the Congress to support our students and back my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in America."}
{"original": "To expand equal opportunity, I am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our Nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities."}
{"original": "A good life for American families also requires the most affordable, innovative, and high-quality healthcare system on Earth. Before I took office, health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just 5 years. I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives. Our new plans are up to 60 percent less expensive. I have also made an ironclad pledge to American families: We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions -- that is a guarantee. And we will always protect your Medicare and your Social Security."}
{"original": "The American patient should never be blindsided by medical bills. That is why I signed an Executive Order requiring price transparency. Many experts believe that transparency, which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year, will be even bigger than healthcare reform. It will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care."}
{"original": "But as we work to improve Americans' healthcare, there are those who want to take away your healthcare, take away your doctor, and abolish private insurance entirely. One hundred thirty-two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our healthcare system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million Americans. To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare!"}
{"original": "Over 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our Nation by providing free taxpayer-funded healthcare to millions of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders. These proposals would raid the Medicare benefits our seniors depend on, while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration. This is what is happening in California and other States -- their systems are totally out of control, costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money. If forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left. But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free Government healthcare for illegal aliens!"}
{"original": "This will be a tremendous boon to our already very-strongly guarded southern border where, as we speak, a long, tall, and very powerful wall is being built. We have now completed over 100 miles and will have over 500 miles fully completed by early next year."}
{"original": "My Administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies. We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs, and medicines are being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before. I was pleased to announce last year that, for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs actually went down."}
{"original": "And working together, the Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels. I have been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in the Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done, and done properly. I am calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices. Get a bill to my desk, and I will sign it into law without delay."}
{"original": "With unyielding commitment, we are curbing the opioid epidemic -- drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years. Among the States hardest hit, Ohio is down 22 percent, Pennsylvania is down 18 percent, Wisconsin is down 10 percent -- and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all."}
{"original": "Protecting Americans' health also means fighting infectious diseases. We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the Coronavirus outbreak in China. My Administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat."}
{"original": "We have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care for Americans with kidney disease, Alzheimer's, and those struggling with mental health challenges. And because the Congress funded my request, we are pursuing new cures for childhood cancer, and we will eradicate the AIDS epidemic in America by the end of the decade."}
{"original": "Almost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness. Here tonight is a special man, someone beloved by millions of Americans who just received a Stage 4 advanced cancer diagnosis. This is not good news, but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet. Rush Limbaugh: Thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country. Rush, in recognition of all that you have done for our Nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and inspire, and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity, I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I will now ask the First Lady of the United States to please stand and present you with the honor. Rush, Kathryn, congratulations!"}
{"original": "As we pray for all who are sick, we know that America is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs. In 2017, doctors at St. Luke's hospital in Kansas City delivered one of the earliest premature babies ever to survive. Born at just 21 weeks and 6 days, and weighing less than a pound, Ellie Schneider was born a fighter. Through the skill of her doctors -- and the prayers of her parents -- little Ellie kept on winning the battle for life. Today, Ellie is a strong, healthy 2-year-old girl sitting with her amazing mother Robin in the gallery. Ellie and Robin: We are so glad you are here."}
{"original": "Ellie reminds us that every child is a miracle of life. Thanks to modern medical wonders, 50 percent of very premature babies delivered at the hospital where Ellie was born now survive. Our goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like Ellie. That is why I am asking the Congress to provide an additional $50 million to fund neo-natal research for America's youngest patients. That is also why I am calling upon the Members of Congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late-term abortion of babies."}
{"original": "Whether we are Republican, Democrat, or Independent, surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God!"}
{"original": "As we support America's moms and dads, I was recently proud to sign the law providing new parents in the Federal workforce paid family leave, serving as a model for the rest of the country. Now, I call on the Congress to pass the bipartisan Advancing Support for Working Families Act, extending family leave to mothers and fathers all across the Nation."}
{"original": "Forty million American families have an average $2,200 extra thanks to our child tax credit. I have also overseen historic funding increases for high-quality child care, enabling 17 States to serve more children, many of which have reduced or eliminated their waitlists altogether. And I sent the Congress a plan with a vision to further expand access to high-quality childcare and urge you to act immediately."}
{"original": "To protect the environment, days ago, I announced that the United States will join the One Trillion Trees Initiative, an ambitious effort to bring together Government and the private sector to plant new trees in America and around the world."}
{"original": "We must also rebuild America's infrastructure. I ask you to pass Senator Barrasso's highway bill -- to invest in new roads, bridges, and tunnels across our land."}
{"original": "I am also committed to ensuring that every citizen can have access to high-speed internet, including rural America."}
{"original": "A better tomorrow for all Americans also requires us to keep America safe. That means supporting the men and women of law enforcement at every level, including our Nation's heroic ICE officers."}
{"original": "Last year, our brave ICE officers arrested more than 120,000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries, 5,000 sexual assaults, 45,000 violent assaults, and 2,000 murders."}
{"original": "Tragically, there are many cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens. In Sanctuary Cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public, instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed."}
{"original": "Just 29 days ago, a criminal alien freed by the Sanctuary City of New York was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92-year-old woman. The killer had been previously arrested for assault, but under New York's sanctuary policies, he was set free. If the city had honored ICE's detainer request, his victim would be alive today."}
{"original": "The State of California passed an outrageous law declaring their whole State to be a sanctuary for criminal illegal immigrants -- with catastrophic results."}
{"original": "Here is just one tragic example. In December 2018, California police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests, including convictions for robbery and assault. But as required by California's Sanctuary Law, local authorities released him."}
{"original": "Days later, the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence. He viciously shot one man going about his daily work; he approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and the chest. He walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon. He hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles, critically injuring innocent victims. One of the victims of his bloody rampage was a 51-year-old American named Rocky Jones. Rocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range, murdering him in cold blood. Rocky left behind a devoted family, including his brothers who loved him more than anything. One of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight. Jody, would you please stand? Jody, our hearts weep for your loss -- and we will not rest until you have justice."}
{"original": "Senator Thom Tillis has introduced legislation to allow Americans like Jody to sue Sanctuary Cities and States when a loved one is hurt or killed as a result of these deadly policies. I ask the Congress to pass the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act immediately. The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans -- not criminal aliens!"}
{"original": "In the last 3 years, ICE has arrested over 5,000 wicked human traffickers -- and I have signed 9 pieces of legislation to stamp out the menace of human trafficking, domestically and around the globe."}
{"original": "My Administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the southern border of the United States."}
{"original": "Before I came into office, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again. My Administration has ended Catch-and-Release. If you come illegally, you will now be promptly removed. We entered into historic cooperation agreements with the Governments of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. As a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75 percent since May -- dropping 8 straight months in a row. And as the wall goes up, drug seizures rise, and border crossings go down."}
{"original": "Last year, I traveled to the border in Texas and met Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz. Over the last 24 months, Agent Ortiz and his team have seized more than 200,000 pounds of poisonous narcotics, arrested more than 3,000 human smugglers, and rescued more than 2,000 migrants. Days ago, Agent Ortiz was promoted to Deputy Chief of Border Patrol -- and he joins us tonight. Chief Ortiz: Please stand -- a grateful Nation thanks you and all the heroes of Border Patrol."}
{"original": "To build on these historic gains, we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit, welcoming those who follow the rules, contribute to our economy, support themselves financially, and uphold our values."}
{"original": "With every action, my Administration is restoring the rule of law and re-asserting the culture of American freedom. Working with Senate Majority Leader McConnell and his colleagues in the Senate, we have confirmed a record number of 187 new Federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written. This includes two brilliant new Supreme Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh."}
{"original": "My Administration is also defending religious liberty, and that includes the Constitutional right to pray in public schools. In America, we do not punish prayer. We do not tear down crosses. We do not ban symbols of faith. We do not muzzle preachers and pastors. In America, we celebrate faith. We cherish religion. We lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the Glory of God!"}
{"original": "Just as we believe in the First Amendment, we also believe in another Constitutional right that is under siege all across our country. So long as I am President I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms."}
{"original": "In reaffirming our heritage as a free Nation, we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation. Now we must embrace the next frontier, America's manifest destiny in the stars. I am asking the Congress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the moon will be American astronauts -- using this as a launching pad to ensure that America is the first nation to plant its flag on Mars."}
{"original": "My Administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical Islamic terrorism. Last week, I announced a groundbreaking plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Recognizing that all past attempts have failed, we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the change to realize a better future."}
{"original": "Three years ago, the barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria. Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS -- the bloodthirsty killer Al‑Baghdadi -- is dead!"}
{"original": "We are joined this evening by Carl and Marsha Mueller. After graduating from college, their beautiful daughter Kayla became a humanitarian aid worker. Kayla once wrote, Some people find God in church. Some people find God in nature. Some people find God in love; I find God in suffering. I've known for some time what my life's work is, using my hands as tools to relieve suffering. In 2013, while caring for suffering civilians in Syria, Kayla was kidnapped, tortured, and enslaved by ISIS, and kept as a prisoner of Al-Baghdadi himself. After more than 500 horrifying days of captivity, Al-Baghdadi murdered young Kayla. She was just 26 years old."}
{"original": "On the night that United States Special Forces Operators ended Al‑Baghdadi's miserable life, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, received a call in the Situation Room. He was told that the brave men of the elite Special Forces team, that so perfectly carried out the operation, had given their mission a name -- Task Force 8-14. It was a reference to a special day: August 14th -- Kayla's birthday. Carl and Marsha, America's warriors never forgot Kayla -- and neither will we."}
{"original": "Every day, America's men and women in uniform demonstrate the infinite depths of love that dwells in the human heart."}
{"original": "One of these American heroes was Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake. On his second deployment to Iraq in 2008, Sergeant Hake wrote a letter to his 1-year-old son, Gage: I will be with you again, he wrote to Gage. I will teach you to ride your first bike, build your first sand box, watch you play sports and see you have kids also. I love you son, take care of your mother. I am always with you. Dad. On Easter Sunday of 2008, Chris was out on patrol in Baghdad when his Bradley Fighting Vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb. That night, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal glory in Arlington, and his wife Kelli is in the gallery tonight, joined by their son, who is now 13 years old. To Kelli and Gage: Chris will live in our hearts forever."}
{"original": "The terrorist responsible for killing Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani, who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chris's life. Soleimani was the Iranian Regime's most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq. As the world's top terrorist, Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women, and children. He directed the December assault on United States Forces in Iraq, and was actively planning new attacks. That is why, last month, at my direction, the United States Military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever."}
{"original": "Our message to the terrorists is clear: You will never escape American justice. If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life!"}
{"original": "In recent months, we have seen proud Iranians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers. The Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons, stop spreading terror, death, and destruction, and start working for the good of its own people. Because of our powerful sanctions, the Iranian economy is doing very poorly. We can help them make it very good in a short period of time, but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help. We are here. Let's see which road they choose. It is totally up to them."}
{"original": "As we defend American lives, we are working to end America's wars in the Middle East."}
{"original": "In Afghanistan, the determination and valor of our warfighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress, and peace talks are underway. I am not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan, many of them innocent. It is also not our function to serve other nations as a law enforcement agency. These are warfighters, the best in the world, and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all. We are working to finally end America's longest war and bring our troops back home!"}
{"original": "War places a heavy burden on our Nation's extraordinary military families, especially spouses like Amy Williams from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and her 2 children -- 6-year-old Elliana and 3-year-old Rowan. Amy works full time, and volunteers countless hours helping other military families. For the past 7 months, she has done it all while her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, is in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment to the Middle East. Amy's kids have not seen their father's face in many months. Amy, your family's sacrifice makes it possible for all of our families to live in safety and peace -- we thank you."}
{"original": "As the world bears witness tonight, America is a land of heroes. This is the place where greatness is born, where destinies are forged, and where legends come to life. This is the home of Thomas Edison and Teddy Roosevelt, of many great Generals, including Washington, Pershing, Patton, and MacArthur. This is the home of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers, Neil Armstrong, and so many more. This is the country where children learn names like Wyatt Earp, Davy Crockett, and Annie Oakley. This is the place where the pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas patriots made their last stand at the Alamo."}
{"original": "The American Nation was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest, strongest, fiercest, and most determined men and women ever to walk the face of the Earth. Our ancestors braved the unknown; tamed the wilderness; settled the Wild West; lifted millions from poverty, disease, and hunger; vanquished tyranny and fascism; ushered the world to new heights of science and medicine; laid down the railroads, dug out canals, raised up the skyscrapers -- and, ladies and gentlemen, our ancestors built the most exceptional Republic ever to exist in all of human history. And we are making it greater than ever before!"}
{"original": "This is our glorious and magnificent inheritance."}

{"original": "London (CNN Business) European stocks had their worst day in history Thursday as fears mounted over economic fallout from the novel coronavirus and measures taken by the European Central Bank to cushion the blow from the crisis failed to impress investors."}
{"original": "The ECB said it would ramp up bond purchases to help support the economy, joining policymakers around the world in a rush to contain the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic."}
{"original": "But the central bank, which also took steps to boost liquidity, did not push interest rates deeper into negative territory, a move that some investors had been expecting. That fed a freefall in European stocks, which were also hit by President Donald Trump's decision to ban travel from more than two dozen countries on the continent."}
{"original": "Europe's Stoxx 600 fell 11%, the index's worst day on record. Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 both plunged over 12%."}

{"original": "As part of its package, the ECB said it would offer more generous loans to banks so they can keep lending to small businesses. And it will buy €120 billion ($134.8 billion) in additional bonds this year, supplementing €20 billion in existing monthly purchases ($22.5 billion)."}
{"original": "The announcement, which was made following a scheduled meeting in Frankfurt, comes after the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England both slashed interest rates by half a percentage point in emergency sessions, citing the risks the coronavirus poses to economic activity."}
{"original": "The moves have done little to placate nervous investors, who have kept selling risky assets at a rapid clip as panic grows."}
{"original": "Years of low interest rates and bond buying have left central banks with limited ammunition to deploy, restraining what policymakers can do should the crisis deepen and increasing pressure on individual governments to boost spending."}

{"original": "While these measures are pretty substantial, we do not think the ECB will be able to change investor sentiment any more than the Fed could last week, said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics. What matters for the economy is the trajectory of the virus itself and the measures which national authorities take to contain it."}
{"original": "Economists increasingly predict that Europe will tip into a recession in the first half of the year as a result of the virus, which has sparked a partial shutdown in Italy and is spreading quickly in other countries."}
{"original": "Lagarde said that the economy should bounce back once the coronavirus outbreak is brought under control. But it's difficult to assess how long that will take."}
{"original": "The best thing to say is that there will be a rebound, Lagarde said. To time it precisely is uncertain. Any recovery, she said, will depend on the enactment of the right set of policy measures from all players."}

{"original": "The Russian lawyer who attended a 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with members of the Trump campaign was charged by federal prosecutors in New York with obstruction of justice in connection with a money-laundering case, according to an indictment unsealed Tuesday that highlighted her ties to the Russian government."}
{"original": "Natalya Veselnitskaya, who gained prominence as a result of a meeting with Donald Trump Jr. and other members of the Trump campaign after he had been promised damaging intelligence on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, was charged by the Manhattan US Attorney's Office, which had handled the money-laundering case involving a Cyprus-based investment firm and its Russian owner."}
{"original": "As that case proceeded, Veselnitskaya, a member of the defense team in that matter, gave a false declaration to the federal court in New York about a response by the Russian government in that case, concealing from the court that she had participated in drafting those supposed independent investigative findings in secret cooperation with a senior Russian prosecutor, according to the indictment."}
{"original": "Her false assertion caused the court to make a ruling she sought, denying the US government's motion for partial summary judgment in the money-laundering case, and was used by the investment firm as the basis for multiple court filings during the litigation, prosecutors said Tuesday."}
{"original": "There is little expectation, however, that Veselnitskaya will face the obstruction charge in a US courtroom. A 43-year-old Russian citizen and resident, she is not in the US, and it's unlikely that she'll ever be taken into custody unless she leaves Russia."}
{"original": "Reached by phone Tuesday, she told CNN that she would defend her professional honor in the case and declined to comment further about the matter, saying she just learned of the news. She added that she was frustrated by US and international media coverage of her."}
{"original": "In announcing the indictment, Manhattan US Attorney Geoffrey Berman said in a statement, We take seriously our responsibility to protect the integrity of the judicial proceedings in this District, and we will not stand idly by while outside influences seek to corrupt and pervert that process."}
{"original": "After seeing Veselnitskaya's comment, Berman told CNN, The proper forum for Ms. Veselnitskaya to contest the charge is the federal court in Manhattan where her criminal case is pending."}
{"original": "Though the obstruction charge Tuesday had no apparent link to the Trump Tower matter, the indictment further solidified the ties between Veselnitskaya and the Russian government – a relationship both she and the Kremlin had denied – and may renew questions about whom she was representing when she sat with officials from the Trump campaign."}
{"original": "Emails released by Trump Jr. show that he agreed to the meeting after being told the crown prosecutor of Russia wanted to give the Trump campaign incriminating information about Clinton. Instead, Trump Jr. later said, Veselnitskaya focused on the repeal of the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law that sanctions Russians accused of violating human rights."}
{"original": "Veselnitskaya has said in interviews that she has a working relationship with Russian Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika and that they exchanged information during her lobbying efforts against the Magnitsky Act. She has denied that she has ever worked for the Russian government, and a Kremlin spokesman has said the notion was absurd."}
{"original": "It's unclear if there was any response from the Trump team to the request from Veselnitskaya concerning the Magnitsky Act. The Trump administration has not moved to roll back the Russian sanctions, and, in fact, new sanctions against Russia have been enacted."}
{"original": "Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the Trump Tower meeting as part of his probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The special counsel's office declined to comment on whether it contributed to the Veselnitskaya investigation or referred it to the US attorney's office. The indictment of Veselnitskaya appears to stem directly from the New York case concerning the Cyprus-based investment firm Prevezon Holdings Ltd. and its Russian owner, Denis Katsyv."}
{"original": "Veselnitskaya attended proceedings in the US for the case, including a hearing in Manhattan on the same day of the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting."}
{"original": "Prevezon was accused by federal prosecutors in New York of stealing $1.9 million from the Russian treasury through a $230 million tax-refund fraud scheme. The alleged scheme was uncovered by Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer. Magnitsky was later jailed by the Russian government and later died in a Moscow prison under suspicious circumstances."}
{"original": "According to the indictment unsealed Tuesday, Veselnitskaya submitted the false declaration to the court in November 2015, saying the Russian government had attempted to withhold from her its response to a request by the US government in the Prevezon case for bank records and other materials showing the flow of the Russian treasury fraud's proceeds, and suggesting she had been forced to seek a court order to overturn the refusal by the Russian Prosecutor General's Office to provide it."}
{"original": "Emails obtained by New York prosecutors, however, show that in 2014 she had sent messages to the personal account of a supervisor in the Russian Prosecutor General's Office with drafts of a response to the US government's request, according to the indictment."}
{"original": "Her emails contained numerous tracked changes and comments, the indictment said, plus insertions of at least 31 paragraphs. The Russian prosecutor subsequently sent her a revised draft of the response, along with notes about additional insertions, the indictment said. The final response sent by the Russian government to the US government contained many of Veselnitskaya's insertions, either essentially verbatim, in rephrased form, or with light edits."}
{"original": "The Russian prosecutor then sought to help Veselnitskaya mask their collaboration by secretly assisting her with filing a formal complaint against his office to make it look as though she had had trouble accessing the Russian response to the US, as she later claimed to the US court."}
{"original": "The Prevezon case was settled before it went to trial."}

{"original": "Don't ever touch your retirement savings!"}
{"original": "Thus says the internet. Think of it as the third rail of retirement advice. And, to be clear, the people who are saying it are right in almost all cases."}
{"original": "After all, we're already woefully behind on our retirement savings — according to a recent study by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies, the median Millennial household only has $37,000 in retirement savings, and the median Baby Boomer household only has $164,000. Raiding your 401(k) fund has the effect of making that situation worse."}
{"original": "Nonetheless, every now and then, a situation crops up where taking out a 401(k) loan may be the least worst option. Here are two."}
{"original": "Of the roughly 29% of Americans who report having taken some kind of early withdrawal or loan from their retirement plan, over half report having done so to pay off credit card debt. The average credit card charges a roughly 12.5% annual interest rate, and the average American household has $7,136 in credit card debt."}
{"original": "The average 401(k) loan, by contrast, usually charges an interest rate a percentage point or two above the prime rate — currently at 4.5%, so assume 6% or so. Even though withdrawing the money means you miss out on the potential compounding of that money in the stock market — historically speaking, between 6% and 7% after inflation — you can see that it's basically a wash between slowly chipping away at a credit card at 12.5% APR versus paying it off in one fell swoop with a 401(k) loan. Plus, the interest you pay on your 401(k) loan is deposited into your 401(k) — so at least those interest payments are going to you and not the bank."}
{"original": "Paying off credit card debt with a 401(k) loan still isn't a good option, but if you're caught in a spiral of high-interest credit card debt that you'll struggle to pay off (perhaps a scenario in which you have twice the average household credit card debt), a 401(k) loan could give you the ability to do a needed reset if you aren't able to take advantage of other, better debt consolidation strategies. You would still have to pay all of the money back with after-tax dollars (meaning that you'd lose out on one of the key benefits to the 401(k) — its tax-deferred status), and if you exit your job, you may be forced to pay the entire balance back immediately. Taking out a loan on your 401(k) isn't an attractive strategy, but it may make sense if you're in a tough spot."}
{"original": "The IRS specifies the circumstances under which a 401(k) provider may (but is not required to) allow for hardship withdrawals by noting that they could be allowed when there is an immediate and heavy financial need of the employee — and the amount withdrawn must be necessary to satisfy the financial need. Put a different way, you have to need money quickly, and there must be no other way you can get that money."}
{"original": "To clarify just how up against a wall you have to be to qualify, the IRS further stipulates that you must have already tapped all other currently available distributions and loans under the plan and all other plans maintained by the employer — meaning you have to have already taken out the maximum possible 401(k) loan (which is the lesser of 50% of the vested balance or $50,000)."}
{"original": "This should be the true last resort, and not just because it's required by tax law. The money you withdraw for financial hardship is fully taxed and may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty. The money may also not be paid back to your 401(k) (unlike in the 401(k) loan example above), and you will be barred from contributing to the 401(k) plan for six months. Your 401(k) balance will permanently shrink, and you'll be barred from doing anything to grow it for six months."}
{"original": "Making the best of a bad situation"}
{"original": "The fact that 29% of Americans report having taken some kind of early withdrawal or loan from their 401(k) is just another sign of how close to the edge too many people are living. It's pretty clear that most Americans aren't tapping their 401(k) for fun. It's because they're in emergency situations, strapped for cash, and starved for options."}

{"original": "So if you're in dire financial straits like those described above, consider taking that loan — and if you qualify for the hardship withdrawal, you probably have no choice but to go for it. When times get better, try to build up an emergency fund that will allow you to handle most financial shocks without major consequences — think at least six months of your nonnegotiable expenses. That's the only way to get into a sufficiently stable spot that you (hopefully) won't ever have to raid your retirement savings again."}
{"original": "Nobody likes to pay more in taxes than they absolutely have to. By the time you start preparing your return, it's too late to use some of the smartest tactics to control the size of your tax bill. Instead, you have to plan in advance to make sure your refund is as big as possible."}
{"original": "Below are three things tax-savvy people do to keep their tax bills low. Using these strategies, you can put a dent in your taxes that will be even more favorable as time goes by."}
{"original": "1. Use tax-favored accounts for investing, especially if you trade actively"}
{"original": "There's no better way to reduce your tax bills than to take advantage of all the ways that the federal government lets you set aside savings to grow on a tax-preferred basis. The most common are the individual retirement accounts and 401(k) plans that millions of Americans use to save for retirement; they provide either upfront deductions or eventual tax-free treatment for your income. But you'll also find a host of alternatives in other areas."}
{"original": "For educational costs, vehicles like 529 plans and Coverdell Education Savings Accounts can let your college savings grow tax-deferred until needed; if used for qualified expenses, those earnings become tax-free."}
{"original": "Even better, health savings accounts can give you an up-front deduction for contributions and tax-free treatment when you use funds for qualifying medical expenses. Certain life insurance products also let you earn tax-deferred income."}
{"original": "The value of tax-deferred and tax-free accounts is that you don't have to pay tax on income and gains when you get them, so you can put off paying at least until you make account withdrawals. Over time, that can save you thousands, since waiting till you're in a lower tax bracket allows you to pay less when the Internal Revenue Service comes calling."}
{"original": "2. Be tax-smart about investments you hold in regular brokerage and financial accounts"}
{"original": "Even in accounts that don't have these tax advantages, there are things you can do to cushion the blow of the tax collector. Long-term investors know they don't have to pay capital gains on stock positions until they sell them, providing a lot of control over tax costs. Knowing your holding period on investments is also important, as waiting until a year and a day has passed means the difference between paying ordinary income tax rates of up to 37% versus lower long-term capital gains taxes of 20% or less."}
{"original": "Certain types of investments also offer tax breaks. Qualified dividends on certain stocks carry a lower tax rate than you'll pay on other stocks. Municipal bonds offer income that's federally tax-free. There are trade-offs involved with using these investments as opposed to higher-tax alternatives, but if you really want to cut your tax bill, it's worth running the numbers to see which way you'll come out ahead."}
{"original": "3. Take full advantage of low tax brackets"}
{"original": "Many people have income that's lumpy, with high income in some years and next to none in others. That can be less than ideal for your tax situation: You can end up paying higher tax rates on portions of your income during good years, while not making full use of low tax brackets during bad ones."}
{"original": "There are ways to smooth out your taxable income so that you don't miss out on tax-saving opportunities. When taxable income is high, make greater contributions to retirement accounts that give you deductions. When it's low, consider selling investments at a gain or converting traditional retirement accounts to Roth accounts. Both of these things will raise your taxable income, but when low tax rates prevail, it's often smarter to pay lower tax now rather than higher tax at some point in the future."}

{"original": "• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market"}
{"original": "Finally, understand that taxes are only one element of smart money management. Holding onto a risky stock an extra month in the hope of turning short-term gains into tax-favored long-term gains might sound smart — unless the stock plunges and those gains suddenly turn into losses."}
{"original": "Nevertheless, it's smart to consider the tax ramifications of any investment moves you're planning. By making good use of tax-favored accounts and investments, you can improve your chances of paying less to the IRS."}
{"original": "New York (CNN Business) The most expensive provision in Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion economic recovery plan is his proposal to send an additional $1,400 to most Americans. According to many economists, that's the least effective way to help revive the economy."}
{"original": "The added stimulus is born out of widespread support among Congressional Democrats, and many Republicans, including outgoing President Donald Trump , to increase the direct payments from the most recent Covid-19 economic relief package from $600 to $2,000"}
{"original": "Six hundred dollars is simply not enough if you still have to choose between paying rent and putting food on the table, Biden said when unveiling his economic recovery plan. Even for those who have kept their jobs, these checks are really important."}
{"original": "The problem with the direct payments, according to economists and others critical of the plan, is that much of the stimulus would go to individuals who have not been financially hurt by the Covid-19 pandemic. That means those added dollars may not do much to boost economic activity."}
{"original": "The $1,400 checks would go to most everyone who makes less than $75,000. Taxpayers filing joint returns who earn less than $150,000 would also qualify. Those earning more could qualify for lesser amounts, with a cap of $87,000 for individual tax filers to be eligible."}
{"original": "That money is not well targeted, said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics."}
{"original": "Zandi said the only economic argument for the checks is that they are a politically feasible way to get a lot of cash into the economy fairly quickly."}
{"original": "Politics matter, and speed is more important than to get it exactly right, he said. But I think it's the second or third best policy. It's certainly not the most effective way to help out."}
{"original": "The money could be a lifeline for struggling taxpayers . But one of the biggest problems, according to economists, is many who receive the checks will either put the money into savings or use it to pay down debt, neither of which will do much to increase overall economic activity."}
{"original": "The accepted theory of household behavior is that a one-time payment does little to spur additional spending, said Joel Prakken, Chief US Economist at IHS Markit. People who do spend it will do so on purchases that aren't likely to be repeated. It's getting harder to argue it'll be an immediate stimulus to the economy."}
{"original": "A big part of the challenge with maintaining consumer spending during the pandemic has been that many of the goods and services people spend money on in normal times aren't available because of the crisis."}
{"original": "Given that lots of the hole [in spending] was not from the fact that people don't want to spend, but that they can't spend because they can't take a flight or they can't go to a restaurant, said Larry Summers, in a recent interview on Bloomberg . Summers served as a top economist in the early days of the Obama administration. I don't necessarily think the priority should be on promoting consumer spending beyond where we are now."}
{"original": "Although Summers has been a supporter of direct payments in the past, he is skeptical that the proposal will be effective this time. I'm not even sure I'm that enthusiastic about the $600 checks, he said. And I think taking them to $2,000 would be a pretty serious mistake."}
{"original": "There is a chance that Biden's proposal for the additional $1,400 payments won't be approved."}
{"original": "The additional round of stimulus would cost the government $465 billion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. That's roughly $100 billion more than is proposed for increased unemployment benefits"}
{"original": "Most experts believe that the full $1.9 trillion package has little chance of becoming law, and is likely to be passed in some scaled back form. In addition to bipartisan support for the checks, there is also bipartisan opposition. Among the leading Democratic critics is Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia."}
{"original": "I'm on board helping people that need help. People that can't make it. People that don't have jobs, they can't put food on the table, Manchin told CNN in a recent interview. Sending checks to people who basically already have a check, and who aren't going to spend it, who are putting it in their savings account right now, that's not who we are. We have done an awful lot of that. It's time now to target where that money goes."}
{"original": "Sen. Mitch McConnell, who will be the minority leader in the new Democratic-controlled Senate, said he also opposes another round of stimulus checks despite support from some members of his caucus."}
{"original": "It's no secret that Republicans have a diversity of views on the wisdom of borrowing hundreds of billions more non-targeted money, including to many households that have suffered no loss of income during the crisis, he said in recent remarks in the Senate. It's hardly clear that the federal government's top priority should be sending thousands of dollars to, for example, a childless couple making well into six figures who have been comfortably teleworking all year. Our duty is to get help to the people who need help."}

{"original": "With soccer-style cheering and a shower of confetti on Sunday, Brazil's Congress voted to impeach President Dilma Rousseff. Yet despite the wishful thinking of legislators and financial markets alike, there is a high risk that the country's crisis will still get worse before it gets better."}
{"original": "Rousseff, a 68-year-old leftist who spent three years in prison under a military regime in the 1970s, has vowed not to go quietly. Because of the rules of impeachment in Brazil, she will likely be President for at least another few weeks – and it could be as late as November until she is definitively removed from office."}
{"original": "That's a recipe for political problems, especially since Rousseff's Workers' Party still has a hard core of support from roughly a fifth of Brazilians. Many of them belong to labor unions, social movements and other groups that will decry any future government as the illegitimate product of a coup. These groups have the organizational power to disrupt society with strikes, protests and roadblocks."}
{"original": "The backdrop to all this is Brazil's worst recession in at least 80 years, and maybe ever."}
{"original": "The economy shrank 3.8% in 2015 and is expected to contract another 3.5% this year. Only three months before Rio de Janeiro hosts the Olympics, its state government says it is running out of cash for public salaries and basic services. Even the most optimistic forecasts don't see a true economic recovery starting until mid-2017. It has been a shocking decline for a country that last decade dazzled the world with commodities-driven growth and seemed on a path to achieve a standard of living similar to countries such as Portugal or Croatia."}
{"original": "The good news is that there's really no mystery to fixing what ails Brazil. The government needs to plug its budget deficit (which hit a whopping 10% of GDP last year) back under control, cut red tape, open up at least a bit more to trade, simplify what the World Bank considers the world's most complicated tax code and generally make Brazil an easier place to do business."}
{"original": "The bad news is that all of these steps are politically difficult. And that's where the With Rousseff gone, Brazil will immediately get better theory starts to fall apart."}
{"original": "If all goes as expected, Vice President Michel Temer will assume the presidency next month on an interim basis while Rousseff is put on trial in the Senate. Rousseff has accused Temer, a 75-year-old constitutional lawyer, of being a coupmonger and a traitor."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, because of the rotten economy and multiple corruption scandals under investigation, polls show that Brazilians have lost faith in their political class generally – not just in Rousseff. Only 16% of Brazilians say they expect Temer would be a good president; 58% say Temer should be impeached, too. Several leaders of Temer's party, the PMDB, are themselves charged with severe corruption."}
{"original": "Does that sound like someone with a mandate to make the tough changes needed to turn the economy around?"}
{"original": "To be sure, Temer could turn out to be a positive surprise."}
{"original": "Markets are certainly betting on that – pushing Brazil's stock market up about 35% so far this year. Indeed, Temer is likely to surround himself with talented economic officials who Wall Street knows and respects. He will enjoy the goodwill of a large swathe of Brazil's political and business establishment, many of whom have grown weary of the Workers' Party after 14 years in power."}
{"original": "There is also a good precedent: When Brazil last impeached a president, in 1992, nobody expected much of the inexperienced successor. Yet Itamar Franco recognized his role as a transitional figure, built consensus and laid the groundwork for a successful wave of pro-market reform."}
{"original": "Still, that was then. The Brazil of 2016 is a more polarized country dealing with a far deeper economic slump. Fixing the hole in the budget and streamlining the bureaucracy will in practice mean sizable spending cuts, potential tax increases and the loss of privileges for certain special interest groups.

{"original": "Banks and other financial companies have shifted at least £800 billion ($1 trillion) worth of assets out of the country and into the European Union because of Brexit, EY said in a report published Monday."}
{"original": "Many banks have set up new offices elsewhere in the European Union to safeguard their regional operations after Brexit, which means they also have to move substantial assets there to satisfy EU regulators. Other firms are moving assets to protect clients against market volatility and sudden changes in regulation."}
{"original": "The consultancy said the figure represented roughly 10% of the total assets of the UK banking sector, and was a conservative estimate because some banks have not yet revealed their contingency plans."}
{"original": "Our numbers only reflect the moves that have been announced publicly, said Omar Ali, head of financial services at EY. We know that behind the scenes firms are continuing to plan for a 'no deal' scenario."}

{"original": "The Bank of England said the fallout from that scenario would be worse than the 2008 financial crisis."}
{"original": "For financial institutions, a no-deal Brexit would be a nightmare. The country's agreements with EU regulators would cease to exist and banks would find themselves in a legal vacuum, meaning they would be unable to continue doing some of their business across the bloc."}
{"original": "While the European Union has said it will implement some steps to avoid a complete meltdown, it said its contingency plan is only a short-term solution aimed at protecting its own interests."}
{"original": "Financial services firms have no choice but to continue preparing on the basis of a 'no deal' scenario, Ali said."}
{"original": "EY said that the companies it tracks have already created around 2,000 new jobs elsewhere in the European Union in response to Brexit."}
{"original": "Deutsche Bank (DB), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citi (C) have already moved parts of their business out of the United Kingdom. Dublin, Luxembourg, Frankfurt and Paris were the most popular destinations."}
{"original": "EY said financial companies were likely to move more assets and create more jobs in other European cities over the coming weeks. The closer we get to March 29 without a deal, the more assets will be transferred and headcount hired locally or relocated, Ali added."}

{"original": "(CNN) -- The presidency of the United States hinged on fewer than 1,000 votes in Florida early today, as what may be the closest presidential race in American history kept either Texas Gov. George W. Bush or Vice President Al Gore from declaring victory. The latest CNN vote count gave Bush a lead of only 926 votes in Florida, a margin well within the one-half of one percent that triggers a recount under state law. Gore, meanwhile, led the popular vote nationwide by slightly more than 60,000 votes out of 94 million-plus ballots cast. Shortly after 2 a.m. EST, CNN and other news organizations projected Bush the winner in Florida, with its 25 electoral votes taking his total to 271 -- one more than the 270 needed to win a majority in the Electoral College. But questions about the Florida count prompted the networks to place Florida back in the too close to call category, leaving Bush with only 246. In this story:"}
{"original": "Third parties seek to influence future races"}
{"original": "We hope and believe we have elected the next president of the United States, Bush campaign chairman Don Evans said about 4:30 a.m. EST. The latest count in the state of Florida shows Gov. Bush winning that state by more than 1,200 votes. They're still counting. They're still counting, and I'm confident when all is said and done, we will prevail. Gore was projected to have 249 electoral votes, with at least two states -- Oregon and Wisconsin -- remaining too close to call this morning. CNN's count of the race showed Bush had received 2,905,033 votes in Florida; Gore had 2,904,107. I would caution both candidates not to make any definitive statements, Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth said in a statement issued early today. CNN's Jeff Greenfield reported that Butterworth, a Democrat who served as Gore's campaign chairman in Florida, called Gore and told him to put off a concession speech until a recount could be performed. Butterworth promised the recount would be done in a relatively short period of time, but said county election supervisors should give their poll workers a chance to rest first. We owe this to the people of this country, because we're talkng about one vote for every five or six precincts in this state, he said. With thousands of Gore supporters standing in the predawn rain in Nashville, Tennessee, campaign chairman William Daley announced Gore would not yet concede the race."}
{"original": "Without being certain of the results in Florida, we simply cannot be certain of the results of the national election, Daley announced shortly after 4 a.m. EST. Gore already had called Bush to congratulate him on his win, when the tightening numbers in Florida prompted him to call again and retract those comments. Daley said Gore and his running mate, Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, were prepared to concede and support Bush if he is officially elected. But this race is simply too close to call, and until the recount is concluded and the results in Florida become official, our campaign continues, Daley said as the crowd roared its approval. Daley said about 5,000 votes remained to be counted in Florida in addition to a recount. I've been in politics a long time, and I don't think there's ever been a night like this one, Daley said. Meanwhile, in the nationwide popular vote, with 97 percent of precincts in, Gore led Bush by 49 to 48 percent. Gore had collected 47,744,437 votes across the country, while Bush had 47,480,638, according to CNN's count. The white-knuckle race appeared to lean Gore's way early in the night, as news organizations projected Gore the winner in Florida based on exit polling. Along with Gore victories in Pennsylvania, Michigan, New York and Illinois, that gave the vice president a large lead in the Electoral College count."}
{"original": "But Bush took a lead in early returns in Florida, and the news organizations that had called Florida for Gore -- including CNN -- quickly switched it back to a toss-up. Watching the returns with his wife and parents, former President George Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush, the GOP nominee said he was not prepared to concede major Eastern states that exit polls indicated were leaning to Gore -- including Pennsylvania and Florida. Both states are led by Republican governors, including the nominee's brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The networks are calling this thing awfully early, but the people counting the votes have a different perspective, the Texas governor said. By 1 a.m., it became clear that both men needed to win Florida to claim the White House -- and about two-thirds of the votes remaining to be counted in Florida came from the Democratic bastions of south Florida, in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas. Late into the night, Gore's deputy campaign manager Mark Fabiani still held out hope of a victory. Bush is slightly ahead now, but that's because the Democratic strongholds in the state -- Dade County and Broward County -- have not had their votes counted yet, Fabiani said. Both campaigns had scrambled to turn out the vote, not only in major states in the Electoral College, but in smaller states where the races were expected to be tight."}
{"original": "Heavy turnout in St. Louis, a Democratic stronghold in the battleground state of Missouri, prompted a judge to extend polling there by three hours. He was overruled later by a state appellate judge after Republicans appealed the decision. An official in the New York borough of Manhattan said he was calling in more volunteers to get help because turnout was greater than he had expected. In the Atlanta, Georgia, area, voters waited as long as three hours to enter voting booths. In the Chicago suburb of Lake Forest, Illinois, poll workers reported the turnout was much better than anything we've seen before. Gore's campaign deployed the Rev. Jesse Jackson in Pennsylvania on Tuesday afternoon and called on Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy's organization to send volunteers to New Hampshire for get-out-the-vote efforts there. I believe we have the best ground troops in America knocking on doors, getting on phones for Gore, Donna Brazile, the vice president's campaign manager, said Tuesday evening. The Gore campaign estimated that it put about 50,000 volunteers into the field during the campaign, sent 50 million pieces of direct mail, made 40 million phone calls and sent 30 million pieces of e-mail by the time polls closed Tuesday. Bush strategist Karl Rove said Monday the Bush campaign sent as many as 243,000 volunteers onto the streets in 28 battleground states, making up to 70 million phone calls and sending out 110 million pieces of mail."}
{"original": "The last days Gore wound up a 30-hour final blitz of campaign stops in Florida before flying home to Tennessee early Tuesday. Al and Tipper Gore voted at a school in Elmwood, near their home in Carthage, before the vice president gave fifth-grade students a civics lesson on the importance of voting. I voted for my husband Al Gore and it was a thrill, Tipper Gore said after casting her ballot. It was wonderful. It was very exciting. Bush voted Tuesday in Austin, telling reporters, We had a long day yesterday, but I feel great. I've been making some phone calls this morning, he said. I've called my parents first thing when I woke up to assure them that I'm feeling pretty good about it ... that we've done all we can do, and it's up to the people of the country to make up their mind. Both candidates spent their last day of campaigning hammering home themes they stressed throughout the past year and a half on the stump. Gore cast the election as a referendum on the prosperity of the past few years, warning that Bush's plans for a $1 trillion-plus tax cut would undercut the foundations of the economic boom."}
{"original": "He criticized Bush's proposal to partially privatize Social Security, saying Bush has promised about $1 trillion from the Social Security Trust Fund to two groups of people: younger workers, who would be allowed to privately invest a share of their payroll taxes; and older Americans who need that money to pay current benefits. Gore promised to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, the federal medical insurance program for seniors --- and he has tried to cast doubts upon the Texas governor's ability to handle the complexities of the job. Gore and President Clinton credited their administration's eight-year federal budgeting strategy for turning the recession of the early 1990s into an atmosphere that has brought about the balanced budget agreement, some 22 million new jobs, and low rates of unemployment in most regions of the country. Bush -- whose father was ousted by Clinton in 1992 in the wake of the last national economic downturn -- argues that though the economy has shown improvement since his father left office, the reasons have little -- to nothing at all -- to do with Gore or Clinton. But with voters unlikely to want broad economic reforms, Bush chose instead to focus on other sensitive areas for overhaul. Those include the public education system; the armed forces; the 35-year-old Medicare health insurance program; and Social Security."}
{"original": "Bush also called for a new era of responsibility in Washington and promised to ease the partisan rancor that has characterized much of American politics in recent years, citing his ability to work with legislators on both sides of the aisle in Texas. And he included a call to restore honor to the White House in nearly every campaign appearance -- a not-so-subtle reference to Clinton's affair with a former White House intern, which led to his 1998 impeachment and acquittal by the Senate the following year. Third parties seek to influence future races While Bush and Gore sprinted around the country hoping to secure the winning margin in the upper Midwest and along the East Coast, minor-party candidates Nader and Pat Buchanan vowed their movements would remain active into the next election cycle. Gore had to spend more time and money in some states that normally would be considered reliably Democratic because of Green Party candidate Nader's challenge from his left. Democrats worried a strong turnout for Nader -- he ended up with about 2.4 million votes, or 3 percent nationwide -- could take votes from Gore and throw the election to Bush. The Greens failed to get the 5 percent of the popular vote they need to qualify for federal matching funds in the 2004 presidential race, but Nader declared the night a win for the party anyway. We're coming out of this election with millions of votes -- with the third-largest political party in America, replacing the Reform Party, he said."}
{"original": "We become a viable watchdog party on the two parties, telling them they need to shape up or they're going to lose votes in the future. Meanwhile, Reform Party candidate Buchanan -- who secured $12.6 million in federal matching funds after the party's raucous convention in August -- said Monday he would be around to serve as a conservative watchdog over a Republican administration. Buchanan earned less than 1 percent of the popular vote after inheriting the mantle of Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who won 8 percent in 1996 and 19 percent in 1992. Buchanan had challenged Bush's father in the 1992 Republican primaries. Asked about the likelihood of a Bush win, Buchanan said, If there is another Bush in the White House, there will be another Buchanan watchdog right outside the White House."}
{"original": "If you earn money, whether in the form of wages, interest, or even gambling winnings, among other things, you are required to pay taxes on that money. And there are very few exceptions to those tax laws."}
{"original": "But one particular exception to that rule stands out: The tax treatment of earnings within a Roth IRA. And that special tax treatment leads to four reasons you should love saving for retirement in a Roth account."}
{"original": "In general, when you contribute to a traditional IRA, you do so on a pre-tax basis. Your money then has the advantage of being able to grow tax-deferred. But it's important to remember that when you withdraw that money -- consisting of both principal and earnings -- you will owe ordinary income taxes on your distributions. And when you are in retirement and no longer bringing in income, you will be responsible for paying those taxes either from your retirement accounts or from other sources of funds."}
{"original": "However, with a Roth IRA, the money you contribute into the account has already been taxed. Then, as long as you follow some basic account requirements, including having a Roth account open for at least five years, everything you earn within the account will grow tax-free and remain tax-free even when you take a distribution. So, if you put in $5 and it grows to $10 -- that $5 of growth is yours, tax-free."}
{"original": "No one knows what the tax rates will be in the future, nor do we know what tax bracket we will be in when we retire. What we do know is the current tax rate and our current tax bracket. And if you save in a Roth today, you generally don't need to worry about future taxes. Whatever you have saved in your Roth IRA will be yours, free and clear."}
{"original": "2. You can leave your Roth untouched throughout your lifetime"}
{"original": "In order to encourage individuals to save for retirement, the government allows us to save in tax-favored retirement accounts. But it won't let you avoid paying taxes on your savings forever."}
{"original": "For traditional IRAs and 401(k) accounts, at age 70 1/2, you typically must begin taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your tax-deferred accounts, at which time you will owe ordinary income taxes. And since you are required to begin drawing down your accounts, you are no longer able to continue contributing money into traditional IRAs past age 70 1/2."}
{"original": "However, these requirements do not apply to the Roth IRA. In fact, you are never required to take distributions from your Roth. Also, you can continue contributing to your account as long as you have taxable compensation, even past age 70 1/2. Ultimately, that allows you to keep your account untouched and intact for your entire lifetime. Which leads us to the next point."}
{"original": "3. You can pass tax-free money to heirs"}
{"original": "Another special feature of the Roth IRA is that you can pass the tax-free benefits of the account to your heirs. Like other retirement accounts, if your spouse inherits your Roth IRA, they can treat the account as if it were their own. Therefore, they can continue holding the Roth and are not required to take distributions from it during their lifetime either, thereby allowing it to grow tax-free for even longer if they wish."}
{"original": "If you leave your Roth IRA to someone other than a spouse (and you've had the account open for the required five-year period), then that beneficiary can also enjoy tax-free withdrawals -- however, one note of difference is that they will be required to take minimum distributions."}
{"original": "Because contributions to a Roth IRA are made with money that has already been taxed, of course, original contributions are always accessible on a tax-free and penalty-free basis. (Again, see here to learn about when your earnings will also be tax-free and penalty-free.) Keep in mind, though, that this money should be earmarked for your future retirement and should only be used as a last resort in case of a true emergency."}

{"original": "When it comes to retirement planning, consideration of taxes should be a big part of your overall strategy. But because your retirement might be decades away, it's hard to know what tax laws will be in place at that time. The smart thing might be to diversify your retirement accounts based on their tax treatment, and a Roth IRA, providing tax-free retirement income, may be a great place to start."}

{"original": "In a closed-door meeting Monday night, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin urged GOP senators to get behind the House bill, which had prompted growing Republican concerns in recent days, with top officials warning the economic situation is too precarious and the threat to public health too severe to let the measure hang in limbo for days."}
{"original": "The cost of the new package will be roughly $850 billion, a source briefed on the matter tells CNN, and will include aid to small businesses and airlines."}
{"original": "Mnuchin signaled Tuesday that after conferring further with GOP senators, the Trump administration is looking at sending checks to Americans rather than a payroll tax holiday."}
{"original": "Asked what the Senate would do when it officially receives the House bill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told CNN bluntly: Pass it."}
{"original": "In the meeting, Mnuchin told GOP senators he would present more details during a Tuesday lunch about the Trump administration's proposal for the next economic package. He also told senators to get behind the House-passed measure, which would ensure individuals have access to free testing for the disease and displaced workers have access to paid leave, bolster unemployment insurance benefits, expand food stamps and increase federal funding for Medicaid programs."}
{"original": "The warning, GOP senators suggested: Act now before it's too late."}
{"original": "I don't think we can assume we can keep reconvening the Senate every week, like we did this week, said Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, after the meeting. I think the assumption is going to be, we're going to do something (and) it's going to be big because we can't assume we can just keep coming back here."}
{"original": "At the meeting Monday, Mnuchin did not detail a price tag for the next economic stimulus measure, but earlier in the day, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York proposed $750 billion in the next plan. Republicans did not reject that number out of hand and said that Congress would likely have to act on a subsequent stimulus measure once the next plan is approved. Already, Congress has appropriated $8.3 billion to deal with the crisis."}
{"original": "We have a real focus on urgent action, Eric Ueland, White House legislative director, told reporters after the meeting. I'm hoping there can be swift action on consensus items."}
{"original": "Ueland and Mnuchin told reporters that the House bill, which the treasury secretary negotiated with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, should be passed immediately despite the concerns among some Republicans that the measure could hurt small businesses."}
{"original": "Again we'll be speaking to the Republicans at lunch tomorrow about the bill but we look forward to them taking it up and passing it, Mnuchin told reporters. But we got a lot more work to do and the main reason why we're here tonight was talking to the Senate about other bills that they're going to work on ASAP."}
{"original": "Trump suggests changes to House bill"}
{"original": "The fast-moving developments came after the House's sweeping coronavirus relief bill, which had been barreling forward in the Senate, had hit a speed bump earlier in the day amid objections by Republicans and a suggestion by President Donald Trump that the Senate would make further changes to the measure."}
{"original": "Also, Trump told reporters that we may very well be adding something to the bill, despite his public endorsement of the measure on Friday night."}
{"original": "I think they may make it even better, Trump said of the Senate. Look, they're working with the House, working very much in unison like the question before. They're working to only enhance it and make it better and make it fair for everybody. And that's what we're looking to do. So we may go back and forth with the House a little bit, but both will be in a very positive fashion."}
{"original": "The measure passed the House by a 363-40 vote early Saturday morning. Some Republicans objected to several of the provisions in the bill, particularly the paid leave program and its potential impact on businesses throughout the country."}
{"original": "One obstacle was removed Monday evening. The House approved a set of changes to the coronavirus stimulus bill by unanimous consent, clearing the path for the Senate to consider it. Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas withdrew his objection to the House's 'technical corrections bill accompanying the coronavirus relief package that passed early Saturday morning. He allowed the measure to advance, saying on the House floor after reviewing the language of the resolution that the changes make the bill better than it was when it got passed."}
{"original": "On Monday, Gohmert said he raised concerns to both Trump and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who also supports the House-passed bill."}
{"original": "The last draft of the 'technical changes' I saw was 87 pages long, Gohmert said in a statement. I cannot in good conscience give my consent to something that has not been finished or made available to members of Congress before it is up for a vote."}
{"original": "Those objections were apparently settled by Monday evening."}
{"original": "Indeed, a growing number of top Republicans suggested that the Senate should quickly adopt the House plan -- and worry about other proposals for the next response to the crisis."}
{"original": "Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Senate GOP leadership team, told CNN it's my inclination to let the House bill pass unchanged and focus on the next bill."}
{"original": "It may be the best thing to do would be to make those changes on the next bill because this isn't the last piece of legislation that we are going to be passing related to the coronavirus, the Texas Republican said."}
{"original": "If we putz around here, we are losing time, said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a West Virginia Republican"}
{"original": "Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican, said she supports moving quickly on the House bill."}
{"original": "The developments come after the Senate scrapped its own recess this week to consider the House bill -- and as senators return to Washington uneasy about the risk they and their staff face by staying in session."}
{"original": "Indeed, prospects appeared to grow slim Monday that the Senate could speed up its schedule this week, but those discussions are expected to during the parties' weekly Tuesday lunches. Democrats are expected to have a conference call for their weekly Tuesday lunch as opposed to meeting in person, an unusual move reflective of how fears over the virus are upending the Senate."}
{"original": "Some Republicans are trying to push for more changes to the bill."}
{"original": "I don't think the House bill is going to pass the Senate as it is written for one basic problem: It doesn't go far enough and it doesn't go fast enough, GOP Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said on the floor of the Senate, referring to the bill's system for small businesses to get tax credits for paid leave for their displaced employees."}
{"original": "In addition to the coronavirus legislation, the Senate also had to consider a measure to renew key authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which expired on Sunday."}
{"original": "The Senate was prepared to take steps to pass the House's bipartisan FISA reauthorization bill, which passed last week, but objections from critics like GOP Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah threatened to eat up several days of the Senate calendar to overcome a filibuster and approve the measure."}
{"original": "Instead, McConnell cut a deal with Lee on Monday that paved the way for the Senate to focus on the coronavirus legislation."}
{"original": "The agreement included a two-and-a-half month extension of the three expired FISA authorities, which passed the Senate by unanimous consent, and agreement to consider amendments from Lee and Paul related to representation for targets of FISA surveillance warrants and limits on searches that can be conducted under the law related to US citizens and the internet."}
{"original": "The short-term extension now has to be cleared in the House by unanimous consent just like the coronavirus changes, meaning any single House member can object and stop it."}
{"original": "But in the Senate, the FISA agreement clears the stage for the chamber to consider the coronavirus legislation — if it can find a way forward amid the disagreements over the bill."}

{"original": "Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election has left plenty of questions hanging with no answers for almost 20 months."}
{"original": "But with the new year, there's the possibility some of these questions will finally be answered."}
{"original": "There are already scheduled hearings and deadlines in former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's criminal cases and a growing expectation of the wind-down of Mueller's work and use of a federal grand jury."}
{"original": "Here are 16 questions about what's to come in the Russia probe:"}
{"original": "How does the Mueller investigation end?"}
{"original": "When he concludes his work, Mueller must provide a confidential report to the attorney general. But before that happens, he could seek additional indictments. So far, Mueller's team has secured guilty pleas from seven people, including President Donald Trump's top two campaign leaders, his former personal attorney and his first national security adviser. Twenty-six others, who are all Russian, have been indicted by Mueller."}
{"original": "In theory, the special counsel will answer a cascade of questions raised in the investigation, including whether he believes Trump obstructed justice, and will release findings on the allegations of coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Mueller will likely assess whether Trump knew in advance about the Trump Tower meeting with Russians in June 2016, whether campaign contacts sought stolen Democratic Party emails, whether foreign money illegally came into the election and what gave rise to the Republican Party changing its platform on Russian intervention in Ukraine."}
{"original": "Will the public see Mueller's findings?"}
{"original": "Whether Mueller's findings will become public and how is another question entirely – one that could lead to a fight of its own. If Mueller and the Justice Department do not make the report public – and if the White House wants to keep it largely secret – Congress could issue a subpoena to try to force its release."}
{"original": "Some details may be held back, because of assertions of executive privilege, grand jury secrecy and other confidentiality considerations. Congress and public interest groups could go to court over what should be released."}
{"original": "From almost the beginning, the threat that Trump or the attorney general could fire Mueller has hung over the probe. But Trump hasn't done it – yet."}
{"original": "Speculation about Mueller's impending dismissal reached a fever pitch last April, after multiple news organizations, including CNN, reported that Trump was furious over the probe and previously directed his White House counsel to fire the special counsel. Don McGahn, who was then the White House counsel, refused."}
{"original": "Now McGahn has left the West Wing, as has chief of staff John Kelly, who presided during much of the time Trump railed against Mueller. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from overseeing the investigation, left the Justice Department in the hands of now-acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who disregarded the advice of a Justice Department ethics official and did not recuse from the probe. The next boss in line to oversee Mueller is Bill Barr, who was attorney general during the George H.W. Bush administration and is again nominated to be attorney general."}
{"original": "Barr's approach to Mueller is yet to be seen. Previously, he wasn't completely supportive of the investigation. He wrote a memo to Justice Department officials in June arguing that an obstruction of justice inquiry into Trump's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey was fatally misconceived."}
{"original": "It's unclear if Mueller has more questions for Trump. The President's team has signaled for months that it would fight if he were asked to testify under subpoena or sit for an interview with Mueller, two situations where lying can be prosecuted as a federal crime."}
{"original": "Instead, the President's defense team held off a court fight by responding in writing to a set of questions from Mueller just before Thanksgiving. They dealt largely with the allegations of Russian collusion and the time period before the inauguration."}
{"original": "But Mueller's team has always been interested in interviewing the President, and the two sides have been in communication as of last month."}
{"original": "If Mueller did send Trump a subpoena for grand jury testimony, historical legal precedent suggests Trump would have to answer questions under oath."}
{"original": "Trump was the chief critic of Mueller in the second half of 2018, calling the investigation a politically motivated witch hunt repeatedly and at a frantic pace."}
{"original": "The Russian Collusion fabrication is the greatest Hoax in the history of American politics, Trump tweeted on December 29."}
{"original": "How long will Mueller's grand jury continue to meet?"}
{"original": "The grand jury used by Mueller to indict Manafort, his deputy Rick Gates and 26 Russians over the past year and a half first assembled in the Washington federal courthouse in the summer of 2017. Its initial 18-month term was extended by up to six months on Friday."}
{"original": "The grand jury has convened on most Fridays, receiving scores of witnesses who gave testimony and hours of findings from prosecutors about the intricacies of Russian attempts to infiltrate US politics."}
{"original": "This secret body of no more than 23 citizens is a powerful tool Mueller can use to compel evidence collection and bring in witnesses. It's also the panel of peers that ultimately votes to approve criminal indictments."}
{"original": "Apparently, it's still doing its work."}
{"original": "The grand jury last gathered on December 21, according to CNN reporting."}
{"original": "Mueller also has the option to present evidence to other established grand juries, such as the one in Virginia he used to open a second case against Manafort."}
{"original": "Beyond Mueller, a new class of investigators was sworn in this week: House Democrats."}
{"original": "Democrats now control the key House committees that can investigate Trump's campaign ties to Russia, his personal finances, obstruction of justice and just about everything in between. These committees have subpoena power and can force key witnesses to turn over sensitive documents, and can demand that Trump's closest allies appear for public hearings to face blistering questions in front of the cameras."}
{"original": "Senior Democrats have said they won't wait for Mueller to complete his probe before launching their own investigations. Though some staunch liberals are clamoring for impeachment, Democratic leaders including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi say that won't be on the table until Mueller closes shop.

{"original": "Will Roger Stone's associate be forced to testify?"}
{"original": "The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has not yet ruled on Stone associate Andrew Miller's attempt to dodge a subpoena and his challenge of Mueller's authority. Miller lost his case before a trial-level judge and was held in contempt of court, then appealed. If he wins, the court could undercut Mueller's appointment within the Justice Department. But if the appeals court sticks with the trial judge's findings and Miller still refuses to testify, he could go to jail."}
{"original": "Miller is one of 13 known Stone associates who've been approached by investigators."}
{"original": "What mystery foreign-state-owned company is trying to hold off a subpoena?"}
{"original": "A second grand jury subpoena challenge related to the Mueller investigation has worked its way to the Supreme Court in recent weeks. That challenge, from an unnamed foreign-government-owned company, is fending off mounting fees for failing to turn over information to the grand jury. As of Friday afternoon, the Supreme Court was still considering whether to freeze the fine."}
{"original": "What are the 'several ongoing investigations' Gates is still helping team Mueller with?"}
{"original": "Last we heard from Gates, he had testified for three days against Manafort at trial and continues to cooperate with respect to several ongoing investigations, his defense lawyer and Mueller's prosecutors said in November. It's notable that prosecutors' status report on Gates hasn't hinted at a coming sentencing, given prosecutors' successful convictions of Manafort. What else could the top Trump campaign and inaugural official be helping Mueller and the Justice Department with?"}
{"original": "The next status report from prosecutors and Gates' legal team is scheduled to be submitted to the court on January 15."}
{"original": "Will powerful Russians get access to national security investigation secrets?"}
{"original": "The Russian company Concord Management and Consulting is fighting this battle in court, as it fends off a criminal indictment for allegedly funding a social media conspiracy to disrupt the 2016 presidential election. Concord has taken a scrappy, antagonistic approach to Mueller's allegations in court."}
{"original": "Concord was the only Russian company or person out of 15 total to fight the propaganda charges – it pleaded not guilty and the oligarch who owns the company has lambasted the allegations as a joke."}
{"original": "The company previously lost in its requests for the court to invalidate Mueller's indictment and authority. Now, its request to access and to share sensitive evidence in the case among Russians gets to what prosecutors believe is the heart of its strategy. Prosecutors say it's particularly risky for Concord to get evidence in the case because of its ties to indicted and sanctioned Russian oligarch Yevgeniy Prigozhin. The judge has yet to decide."}
{"original": "Over and over again, one name – Konstantin Kilimnik – has been connected to several parts of the Mueller investigation. Could Kilimnik be at the heart of Mueller's pursuit?"}
{"original": "Kilimnik surfaced first last year in the case against Dutch lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, when Mueller's team admitted it cared about how van der Zwaan had connected with Kilimnik and Gates in fall 2016."}
{"original": "They also said Gates knew Kilimnik worked for the Russian military intelligence agency, GRU, which Mueller alleges hacked the Democrats in 2016."}
{"original": "Most recently, Mueller's team acknowledged it had asked Manafort several things about Kilimnik and their meetings, and it said Manafort had lied to the prosecutors about his contact with his longtime foreign colleague. Though the Justice Department has not said it yet publicly, Kilimnik met with Manafort twice during the Trump campaign and helped Manafort offer a Russian oligarch briefings on the election, according to reports from other news organizations and Manafort's and Kilimnik's public statements."}
{"original": "Another cooperator in the Mueller investigation, lobbyist W. Samuel Patten, also had contact with Kilimnik through 2017, as they secured tickets to the Trump inauguration for a paying Ukrainian oligarch client."}
{"original": "Like Gates, Patten's cooperation with the special counsel's office has stayed under wraps and apparently continues."}
{"original": "Mueller indicted Kilimnik last year for attempting to tamper with potential witnesses in Manafort's case, and said he had worked with Manafort and Gates to carry out the criminal schemes to which Manafort has admitted. The question remains: What else have they learned about him?"}
{"original": "Because he lives in Russia, Kilimnik has not yet appeared in US court to enter a plea. He has not publicly responded to the obstruction charges. In interviews, he has denied working for Russian intelligence."}
{"original": "How many years will Manafort serve in prison?"}
{"original": "A prison sentence is a near certainty."}
{"original": "The former Trump campaign chairman and lobbyist will go before federal Judge T.S. Ellis on February 8 for his first sentencing on eight tax and bank fraud convictions. And, following a broken plea deal, Manafort is scheduled to be sentenced by a second judge about a month later for additional crimes, though this date may be pushed back."}
{"original": "Before then, the public may learn more about Manafort's lies to prosecutors during his nine cooperation sessions with Mueller's office, which began after he pleaded guilty to avoid a second trial. Manafort has lived in jail since June, when prosecutors accused him of attempted witness tampering. The possibility that prosecutors would ask for leniency for Manafort has evaporated."}
{"original": "The mounting convictions set Manafort up for a decade or more of prison time. His prospects look bleak."}
{"original": "However, Manafort has one Hail Mary he can still pray for: a pardon from the President."}
{"original": "What did Michael Cohen tell prosecutors?"}
{"original": "This is what special counsel office prosecutor Jeannie Rhee said at Michael Cohen's criminal sentencing in December: He has provided our office with credible and reliable information about core Russia-related issues under investigation and within the purview of the special counsel's office."}
{"original": "What could those core Russia-related issues be? It's not yet clear whether Cohen's assistance will boost other threads of the investigation."}
{"original": "Mueller's team said in an earlier court filing that Cohen spoke to investigators about communication efforts between the Trump campaign and the Russian government in 2016 and about his contact with White House officials in 2017 and 2018."}
{"original": "They also indicated that Cohen was in touch with White House staff and Trump's lawyers while he prepared a written false statement to Congress, for which he was criminally charged."}
{"original": "The Justice Department instructions for Mueller's investigation put the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election at its core."}
{"original": "Will Julian Assange ever leave the Ecuadorian Embassy?"}
{"original": "The Ecuadorian government has signaled unhappiness with its guest of almost seven years at its London embassy – setting up a will-it-or-won't-it scenario that could force Assange into US authorities' custody. Assange originally stepped inside the embassy in 2012 while wanted for questions over sexual assault allegations in Sweden. He's maintained his innocence, and since then has become a focus in Mueller's investigation of the Russian hack and public distribution of the Hillary Clinton campaign emails and information from Democratic Party computers in 2016. Justice Department investigations of Assange and his outlet WikiLeaks date to at least 2010, when the site posted files from former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning."}
{"original": "Recently, US prosecutors – in an apparent slip-up – mentioned in a court document that Assange has been charged in a still-secret federal court case. It's not yet known what he's been charged with, or if the case relates to Mueller's investigation at all."}

{"original": "What do prosecutors intend for Roger Stone?"}
{"original": "Several signs for months now have pointed toward a grand jury investigation into Roger Stone's alleged pursuit of stolen Clinton and Democratic documents and his alleged communications with WikiLeaks."}
{"original": "That Mueller has called upon Stone associates for information, documents and grand jury testimony is the most obvious part."}
{"original": "The Mueller team also mentioned an unnamed person – believed to be Stone – in describing Russian hackers' contacts with Americans around the time they were releasing damaging Democratic emails in 2016. Stone bragged about close ties with Assange during the 2016 campaign but then revised his story and said he was just repeating publicly available information."}
{"original": "The fullest account of Stone's actions in 2016 came in draft court filings and text messages Stone associate Jerome Corsi shared with CNN in November. Corsi says Mueller presented him with the option to plead guilty to a lying charge, but he rejected the deal. The draft filings from November describe how Stone allegedly pushed his associates to get stolen Democratic documents from WikiLeaks before they went public."}
{"original": "Two weeks ago, the House Intelligence Committee agreed to send Mueller transcripts of a 2017 closed-door interview with Stone, indicating his statements to Congress about the Russia investigations are at the heart of the special counsel's interest."}
{"original": "Stone has not been publicly charged with a crime. He has said he believes he will be indicted, and he has asked his online supporters to help his legal defense."}
{"original": "In one of the more dramatic courtroom moments of 2018, Michael Flynn was encouraged by a federal judge to delay his sentencing and cooperate further with the government."}
{"original": "Mueller's office had asked for no jail time for the former national security adviser after he provided the Justice Department with substantial assistance in investigations, yet federal Judge Emmet Sullivan was clearly incensed that the former high-ranking military and intelligence leader had lied to the FBI in his first days in the Trump administration."}
{"original": "Will Flynn ultimately go to prison, like the four Mueller defendants who have already been sentenced? And is there more he can do to help the Justice Department and Mueller's team before he appears before Sullivan again? His next in-court update is due on paper in mid-March."}
{"original": "For all of the above topics, the special counsel's office declined to comment."}

{"original": "Gradually mushrooming on an otherwise barren 886-acre parcel of land in Gujarat – Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state – is a small collection of buildings that India hopes will one day rival financial centers like Singapore, Dubai and Hong Kong."}
{"original": "It's called Gujarat International Finance-Tec City, or GIFT City."}
{"original": "Except for the fact that we are not sitting in Singapore and GIFT City is not Singapore, I think from a business perspective we have everything that is required, Ajay Pandey, the city's CEO, told CNN."}
{"original": "Two stock exchanges were established in the city last year, and government exemptions recently made trading virtually tax-free. The city will also have its own financial regulator, part of an effort to reduce red tape and bureaucracy faced by foreign investors."}
{"original": "Eventually GIFT city should become a vehicle or a place for people from across India like Hong Kong has acted for China in the last 30 or 40 years, said Bombay Stock Exchange CEO Ashishkumar Chauhan."}
{"original": "We think the India INX will provide a platform to corporates and investors from abroad to meet, trade and invest in the growth story of India, he added."}
{"original": "Investors are taking notice – when trading started 15 months ago, the exchange hosted daily trading worth around $1 million. On Monday, that number crossed $500 million for the first time."}
{"original": "The moment you hit close to half a billion dollars, that's the time that some of the big names of the world – JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and others – begin to step in, said Pandey. Things are beginning to roll."}
{"original": "Next on the agenda? Getting people to actually live there."}
{"original": "The city currently consists of just a handful of structures – three large office buildings to which workers are bussed from surrounding areas, a school and a data center. Its first residences will be ready by May, and a four-tower World Trade Center complex is expected to be completed in the next two years."}
{"original": "Transportation links are good: Ahmedabad airport is only a 25 minute drive."}
{"original": "GIFT City has already attracted close to $2 billion in real estate investment, and Pandey expects that number could eventually rise to nearly $11 billion."}
{"original": "The CEO admits that competing with Singapore or Hong Kong is still a long way off."}

{"original": "For millions of small businesses still struggling to make ends meet , they may now apply for a new, potentially forgivable federal loan."}
{"original": "The Paycheck Protection Program reopened onMonday. But initially it wasonly available to businesses applying at community financial institutions. Thoseare banks and lenders that provide funding for small businesses in underserved communities , many of which had a hard time securing loans during the previous rounds of PPP lending or didn't apply."}
{"original": "The US Treasury and the Small Business Administration said Wednesday that on January 15 the program would be open for businesses applying for a loan at 5,000 more lenders, including community banks, credit unions, and farm credit institutions. Then, on January 19, the program will be open for businesses applying at all PPP lenders, including the major banks."}
{"original": "The latest Covid relief package signed into law at the end of December included $284 billion for additional lending to eligible businesses, including those that already received a loan months ago."}
{"original": "The package also included measures intended to make PPP loans more flexible for all small businesses, more helpful to hard-hit restaurants and more accessible to micro businesses than it was in the first two rounds of lending."}
{"original": "Here are six ways the program has changed for this latest round:"}
{"original": "Businesses may now get a second PPP loan. Businesses that got a PPP loan when the program first went into effect now may apply for a second draw, so long as they're not a public company, don't employ more than 300 people, have used or will fully use their first PPP loan for authorized uses, and can show at least a 25% drop in gross receipts in the first, second or third quarters of this year compared to the same quarter in 2019."}
{"original": "Targeted funds are being made available for the most vulnerable businesses. Specific amounts -- ranging from $15 billion to $25 billion -- are earmarked for community development financial institutions -- which typically lend to minority-owned businesses in underserved communities -- and for businesses with fewer than 10 employees, as well as those in low-income areas."}
{"original": "Restaurants can get bigger loans. Most eligible businesses may get a loan equal to 2.5 times their average monthly payroll expenses, just as before. But restaurants and lodging businesses may now apply for loans equal to 3.5 times monthly payrolls."}
{"original": "No loan, however, may exceed $2 million, down from the previous cap of $10 million."}
{"original": "There is greater flexibility in how the loan may be used and still be fully forgiven. For any PPP loan to be fully forgiven, at least 60% of the money must be used for payroll expenses. But the remaining 40% or less may be used to cover an even broader swath of business expenses than was the case during the initial rounds of PPP lending."}
{"original": "Beyond mortgage interest, rent and utility payments, the loan now may be used to cover the costs of personal protective equipment and other expenses incurred to meet Covid restrictions, as well as certain operations, property damage and supplier costs."}
{"original": "The forgiveness process is simpler. In order to have a PPP loan forgiven, businesses that borrowed $150,000 or less will simply need to submit a one-page certification that includes the number of employees the business retained as a result of the loan, an estimate of how much of the loan was spent on payroll and the total loan amount. Borrowers must also attest that the information is accurate and that they complied with loan requirements."}
{"original": "This should help many small businesses that got PPP loans during earlier lending rounds. A full 87% of the loans were below $150,000, according to the Small Business Administration."}
{"original": "The tax break for PPP loan recipients just got bigger. While the loans will be tax-free for recipients if they're used for authorized purposes, the latest Covid relief package sweetened the pot further."}
{"original": "Businesses normally deduct their payroll and operating expenses from their gross income. Now, even if those expenses were largely paid for by the tax-free loan, they will still be deductible."}

{"original": "The new marijuana law, implemented on Saturday, contains a requirement that only Nevada's alcohol distributors can legally transport the product from cultivators to stores, known as dispensaries."}
{"original": "The problem is, none of the liquor companies have been licensed by the state to do it."}
{"original": "I think they'd like to do it; they're just not ready, said Andrew Jolley, CEO of The Source, a company with dispensaries in Las Vegas and its suburb Henderson. We hope we have sufficient supply to last a few days or weeks until the distributors are able to come online to supply us."}
{"original": "That's the big if. Since sale of recreational marijuana became legal to people aged 21 and older, business has been brisk. Long lines of customers have formed at dispensaries that until last week had been authorized to sell only medical marijuana."}
{"original": "ReLeaf, a medical dispensary in Las Vegas that opened in 2015, says it served about 1,000 customers each day this weekend. Most of them were tourists from out of state, according to COO Al Fasano. He said that's seven or eight times the usual business of 100 to 150 medical buyers per day."}

{"original": "Nevada residents voted in November 2016 to legalize recreational marijuana sales, and lawmakers and regulators spent the next few months crafting the rules of how and where this could happen and how the industry would be taxed."}
{"original": "State regulators decided that the transportation of recreational marijuana should fall exclusively to liquor distributors for the first 18 months of legal sales."}
{"original": "But when the state reached out to the liquor distributors about the new enterprise, only a few replied, and they said they didn't want to do it, according to the Nevada Department of Taxation."}
{"original": "The department then opened up the transportation of inventory to other businesses -- and the liquor distributors cried foul."}
{"original": "Their industry group, the Independent Alcohol Distributors of Nevada, sued the tax department to block other businesses from participating. Last month, a Carson City judge ruled in favor of the liquor distributors, giving them the exclusive right to transport recreational weed from the farms to the stores. The tax department is appealing the decision."}

{"original": "Tax returns are due today -- April 18, 2017 -- as is any remaining money you owe to Uncle Sam for 2016."}
{"original": "So if you still have an unpaid balance for last year, you'll have to act fast to avoid getting penalized."}
{"original": "The best thing you can do is file your 2016 tax return, or at least file for an automatic six-month extension."}
{"original": "If you don't do either, you'll be hit with a failure-to-file penalty. That will amount to 5% of your unpaid taxes for every month -- or part of a month -- that you don't file for up to five months. So that penalty will cap out at 25% of your unpaid taxes."}
{"original": "On top of that you'll be subject to a failure-to-pay penalty, which amounts to 0.5% of your unpaid taxes every month, for up to 50 months, for a maximum of 25% of your outstanding balance."}
{"original": "Did we mention interest? On top of these penalties, you'll also be charged interest on your unpaid taxes starting on April 19."}
{"original": "Here's what you should do if you owe money but still haven't filed:"}
{"original": "As the IRS helpfully notes, the failure-to-file penalty is 10 times more than the failure-to-pay penalty. So if you can't pay in full, you should file your tax return and pay as much as you can. Or at least file for an extension and include some payment with it."}
{"original": "Learn what your payment options are."}
{"original": "The IRS has a number of payment plans available if you can't pay all that you owe."}
{"original": "If you owe more than $10,000, you might consider hiring a tax attorney, enrolled agent or CPA with experience setting up payment plans to represent you."}
{"original": "The more that is owed to the IRS, the more complicated it becomes to negotiate with the government, according to Garrett and Deborah Gregory, two former IRS attorneys who wrote the Guide to IRS Collections for Liabilities under $10,000."}
{"original": "Filing may help you avoid a late-payment penalty"}
{"original": "If you've already paid at least 90% of the taxes you owe for 2016, you may be spared the late-payment penalty so long as you at least file for an extension. You will, however, still owe interest on your unpaid balance until it's paid off."}
{"original": "If you're reading this and thinking I don't have to file today because I probably don't owe any more money, file anyway. What if you're wrong and it turns out you do owe money? If you don't file your return or apply for an extension, you'll get hit with the penalties above plus interest."}
{"original": "Second, if you're owed a refund, why wait? The average refund the IRS has paid out so far this year is $2,850."}
{"original": "President Trump often says that Mexico is the big winner from free trade with the U.S."}
{"original": "It has been a one-sided deal from the beginning of NAFTA, Trump tweeted on Jan. 26, referring to the trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada."}
{"original": "But Mexico's experience with NAFTA has been anything but a clean victory."}
{"original": "Poverty in Mexico has increased since NAFTA became law in 1994, and the country's economy performed worse than many of its peers in Latin America, according to a new study published by the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a left-leaning think tank."}
{"original": "Many people think that since American workers lost out from NAFTA, Mexicans must have benefited, says Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the think tank. But the data show that this is not true."}

{"original": "NAFTA's fate is coming to a head as the Trump administration prepares to formally kick off a 90-day countdown to start talks with Mexico and Canada."}
{"original": "Several studies show that Mexico both won and lost from NAFTA, depending on the sector of its economy. That's akin to the U.S. experience -- broadly speaking, some U.S. manufacturers suffered while many American farmers gained."}
{"original": "The latest analysis cites Mexican government figures and finds that about 55% of Mexicans today cannot afford basic expenses, such as food, housing, health care, education transportation and clothing. That's up from 52% in 1994, which may sound like a small increase, but it amounts to an additional 20 million Mexicans living under these conditions."}

{"original": "Mexico also ranks 15th out of 20 in Latin America in GDP per capita -- a measure of the population's purchasing power. Between 1994 and 2016, growth in Mexico's GDP per capita averaged 1.2%, significantly lower than other nations such as Colombia, Peru and Chile, according to CEPR."}
{"original": "A double whammy for Mexico was the entry of China into the World Trade Organization in 2001. China quickly became Mexico's biggest competitor over trade with the United States."}
{"original": "China's share of trade with the U.S. increased sharply after it joined the WTO, which hurt Mexico's prospects and share of the U.S. market."}
{"original": "NAFTA has also hurt rural Mexico. According to the think tank's research, Mexico lost about 2 million farming jobs between 1991 and 2007 (it didn't provide more recent data)."}
{"original": "Large-scale U.S. farmers, especially corn farmers, outperformed production from their Mexican counterparts, many of whom owned small and medium-size farms that lacked advanced technology."}

{"original": "Related: My American job is moving to Mexico"}
{"original": "In general, Mexico did win when it comes to the manufacturing sector. Over 80% of Mexico's exports go to the U.S. tax-free today. American companies of all stripes, from John Deere (DE) to Krispy Kreme, have created jobs in Mexico since NAFTA began."}
{"original": "And other data does show that poverty in Mexico has actually declined in some respects. According to World Bank data, in 1994 there were 9.2 million Mexicans living in poverty, defined as living on $1.90 a day -- a yardstick which has been adjusted for inflation over the years. Today, that figure stands at 3.8 million."}
{"original": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump made false claims from the first hours of his term to the last."}
{"original": "Trump repeated some of his favorite falsehoods in both his farewell video address , which was released on Tuesday, and in his final speech on Wednesday morning at Joint Base Andrews."}
{"original": "One more time, here is a fact check roundup."}
{"original": "In the video address, Trump said he appointed nearly 300 federal judges. In his final speech, similarly, Trump said he got almost 300 federal judges and three great Supreme Court justices. He added in the speech: That's a record-setting number."}
{"original": "Facts First: Trump was incorrect, both with his number and with his claim to have set a record. He got 234 total judges confirmed to the Supreme Court, district courts and appeals courts, according to figures from Brookings Institution visiting fellow Russell Wheeler; even if you round generously, that doesn't qualify as almost 300. And President Jimmy Carter appointed 261 total judges, according to Wheeler -- 39% of the judgeships available at the time compared to Trump's 27%."}
{"original": "Trump claimed in the video address, for more than the 160th time as President, that he is the one responsible for the creation of the Veterans Choice health care program: We passed VA Choice. (He made a less explicit version of the claim in his final speech.)"}
{"original": "Facts First: Trump was wrong again. Former President Barack Obama signed the Veterans Choice program into law : Trump was wrong again. Former President Barack Obama signed the Veterans Choice program into law in 2014 . What Trump signed was a 2018 law, the VA MISSION Act , that modified and expanded the eligibility criteria of the Choice program."}
{"original": "The 2014 law Obama signed, which allowed certain veterans to be covered by the government for health care provided by doctors outside the VA system, was a bipartisan initiative spearheaded by two senators Trump repeatedly criticized, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and the late John McCain of Arizona."}
{"original": "We've called Trump's claim that he got Veterans Choice one of his 15 most notable lies in office"}
{"original": "Trump claimed in the video address: We also unlocked our energy resources and became the world's No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas by far."}
{"original": "Facts First: While US energy production did indeed : While US energy production did indeed increase under Trump, Trump does not deserve credit for the US reaching the number-one spot in overall energy production. The US actually became the world's top total producer of oil and natural gas under President Barack Obama in 2012 , according to data published by the government's Energy Information Administration. It was crude oil in particular in which the US became the world's top producer during Trump's tenure."}
{"original": "The United States has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when US natural gas production surpassed that of Russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded Saudi Arabia's, the Energy Information Administration says"}
{"original": "Trump claimed in the video address that, under him, the US had built more than 450 miles of powerful new wall."}
{"original": "Facts First: This needs context. It is true that more than 450 miles of border barriers were built under Trump -- 453 miles as of January 8, 2021, according to official US Customs and Border Protection statistics provided to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez. However, just 47 of these 453 miles were erected where no barriers had existed before."}
{"original": "Of the other 406 miles: 351 miles replaced previously existing primary barriers that the government describes as dilapidated or outdated; 22 miles replaced previously existing dilapidated or outdated secondary barriers; 33 miles were new secondary barriers where there had previously been only primary barriers."}
{"original": "We shouldn't dismiss the significance of even replacement barriers, since many of the Trump-era barriers are significantly bigger , more expensive and more controversial than the barriers they replaced. But it's worth noting that Trump did not put 450 miles of barriers on terrain that previously had no defenses whatsoever."}
{"original": "Trump claimed in his final speech that we just got 75 million votes, a record for a sitting president."}
{"original": "Facts First: This is another little exaggeration. Trump received : This is another little exaggeration. Trump received 74.2 million votes in the 2020 election, which does not round to 75 million. Trump's total is indeed a record for a sitting president, but Trump also did not acknowledge that Joe Biden got over 7 million more votes than he did."}
{"original": "Trump boasted in the video address that he achieved record low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women..."}
{"original": "Facts First: There are two inaccuracies here. First, the unemployment rate for women never hit a record low under Trump. (Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, it was : There are two inaccuracies here. First, the unemployment rate for women never hit a record low under Trump. (Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, it was among the lowest in US history but not the very lowest.) Second, the unemployment rates for all of these groups are no longer anywhere near record levels; Trump's boast ignores the fact that unemployment rates skyrocketed early in the pandemic and remain elevated today."}
{"original": "The December 2020 unemployment rate for African Americans was 9.9% . That is well above the 8.0% of Trump's first full month in office, February 2017, and the record 5.2% of August 2019."}
{"original": "The December 2020 unemployment rate for Hispanic Americans was 9.3% . That is well above the 5.6% of February 2017 and the record 4.0% of September 2019."}
{"original": "The December 2020 unemployment rate for women was 6.7% . That is well above the 4.6% of February 2017 and the record 2.7% of May 1953."}
{"original": "The December 2020 unemployment rate for Asian Americans was 5.8% . (This rate is not seasonally adjusted; the rates for the other groups in this fact check are seasonally adjusted.) That is well above the 3.5% of February 2017 and the record 2.0% of May 2018."}
{"original": "In his final speech, Trump boasted about his record on jobs, saying that we have such good -- and have had -- such good job numbers. The job numbers have been absolutely incredible. He continued: When we started, had we not been hit by the pandemic, we would have had numbers that would never have been seen -- already our numbers are the best ever."}
{"original": "Facts First: Trump's grammar makes this claim a little hard to fact check -- he seemed to go back and forth from boasting about the past to boasting about the present -- but he obviously does not already have the best jobs record of any president. In fact, thanks to the steep job losses of the pandemic era, he leaves office with the US : Trump's grammar makes this claim a little hard to fact check -- he seemed to go back and forth from boasting about the past to boasting about the present -- but he obviously does not already have the best jobs record of any president. In fact, thanks to the steep job losses of the pandemic era, he leaves office with the US at about 3 million fewer jobs than when he took office. No other president in the post-World War II era, the period for which we have good official data, has had a negative jobs record."}
{"original": "Trump's record on jobs creation lagged behind that of several other presidents even before the pandemic."}
{"original": "Trump claimed in both the farewell video and his final speech to have passed the largest tax cuts in US history."}
{"original": "Facts First: Trump's 2017 tax cuts were not the largest in American history. There have been bigger tax cuts whether you measure in inflation-adjusted dollars or as a share of the national economy."}
{"original": "Tax cuts in 1981, 2010, and 2013 were larger, both in inflation-adjusted dollars or as a share of the economy. As a share of the economy, there were even others that were bigger, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget , a think tank focused on fiscal policies."}
{"original": "The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed in 2017 under Trump, provided for cuts that are among the largest in nominal terms, but even then they are still smaller than tax cuts passed in 2013."}
{"original": "When it comes to retirement saving, a 401(k) is often considered the gold standard."}
{"original": "A 401(k) certainly makes saving easier. The money is taken directly from your paycheck, before you get a chance to spend it elsewhere. Making contributions lowers your taxes, and some employers even match the amount you save."}
{"original": "But a third of private sector employees don't have access to a workplace retirement plan. Plus, about 15 million Americans are self-employed."}
{"original": "The good news is that there are other accounts you can open yourself that offer similar benefits. For some self-employed people, the benefits can be even better than a traditional 401(k) plan's."}
{"original": "Most self-employed people totally forget to set these up and don't fund them. So they end up paying too much in tax and not having enough saved for retirement, said Mari Adam, a certified financial planner and president of Adam Financial Associates."}
{"original": "There are several types of IRAs that might be available to you, as well as an Individual 401(k). They vary by the amount you can save each year and when you'll see tax benefits. Eligibility requirements vary, too, based largely on what kind of income you earn."}
{"original": "If your employer doesn't offer a retirement account"}
{"original": "Maybe your employer doesn't offer retirement accounts like 401(k)s. Or maybe there is a workplace plan, but you haven't worked there long enough to be eligible."}
{"original": "If that's the case — and you don't have any freelance income — you're left with two options: a Traditional or Roth IRA. They both allow your money to grow tax-free."}
{"original": "If you choose a Traditional IRA, you might be able to deduct your contributions and lower your tax bill. But you can't touch your money until age 59 ½ without getting hit with a penalty."}
{"original": "Contributions to Roth IRAs are not tax deductible, but you can withdraw the money in retirement tax free. Plus you can access the money you put in (not your investment gains) at any time, without penalty."}
{"original": "Related: Millennials explain why they have nothing saved for retirement"}
{"original": "Compared to other retirement accounts, Traditional and Roth IRAs have low contribution limits. Both currently allow you to save up to $5,500 annually (or up to $6,500 if you're 50 or older). Even if you contribute the max each year, you probably won't have enough to fund a comfortable retirement without saving elsewhere."}
{"original": "To save extra money, the best thing is to use a plain old brokerage account, said Adam."}
{"original": "You won't get a tax deduction, but you'll be able to access your money at any time to use for any reason."}
{"original": "If you're self-employed, without any employees"}
{"original": "Earning some kind of self-employment income opens up more options for you."}
{"original": "The Individual 401(k), also known as a Solo 401(k), is available to anyone who works for themselves and does not have employees. It works for business owners as well as people with side hustles."}
{"original": "Contributions are tax deductible and the limit is high. You can currently put up to $18,500 in annually, plus additional money of up to 25% of your income. Total annual contributions cannot exceed $55,000. (You can put more in if age 50 or older.)"}
{"original": "There's going to be more paperwork to open an Individual 401(k) than a Traditional or Roth IRA, but Adam says it's free and easy to set up."}
{"original": "Related: 66% of Millennials have nothing saved for retirement"}
{"original": "Once you have freelance income, you are also eligible for a SEP IRA — which is a little less complex. Contributions are tax deductible, but limited to 25% of your income if running a business or 20% of your income if self-employed."}
{"original": "So it might not make sense if you have a small side gig. If you're earning less than $22,000 in self-employment income, you probably won't be able to contribute any more to a SEP IRA than you would for a Traditional or Roth."}
{"original": "An online calculator like this one can help you decide what account allows you the biggest contribution, based on your earnings."}
{"original": "Related: How to retire by 40"}
{"original": "You cannot open an Individual 401(k) if you have employees. Instead, Adam suggests using a Simple IRA."}
{"original": "It requires you, as the business owner, to offer up to a 3% match to participating employees every year. You can't skip contributing some years, like you can with the other accounts."}
{"original": "But in return, you can contribute up to $12,500 a year (more if age 50 and older) and deduct it from your taxes."}
{"original": "There might be a small fee to administer a Simple IRA. If that's too much for you to take on, you can still open a SEP IRA. But be aware that if you contribute for yourself, you must also contribute for your employees. An employer must contribute the same percentage of compensation for every worker."}

{"original": "The Labor Department will release the final employment report of 2018 Friday. In one of the worst months for the stock market in decades, hiring may have begun to slow as well."}
{"original": "It probably won't be dramatic — economists polled by Refinitiv are projecting that employers added 178,000 jobs in December, which would be more than enough to accommodate the natural growth of the labor force. As the American population grows, the economy needs to add about 110,000 jobs each month just to keep pace."}
{"original": "With an unemployment rate forecast of 3.7% – the same as last month and still the lowest in nearly 50 years – modest jobs growth could also be a sign that businesses are just having trouble finding enough people to fill jobs."}

{"original": "But 178,000 new jobs would still be a notch less than the 204,000 jobs the economy has added on average over the last year, and another relatively weak month after November's 155,000 jobs added."}

{"original": "The Labor Department will remain funded during the shutdown, so the preparation of Friday's and future reports will not be affected. But if the shutdown continues through next week, the number of workers on furlough could show up in the January survey.

{"original": "Story highlights On Holocaust Remembrance Day, Deborah Lipstadt calls Livingstone linking Hitler to Zionism ludicrous London mayor's attempt to twist history indicative of an effort to stir disgust by association, she says"}
{"original": "Editor's Note: Deborah E. Lipstadt, Dorot professor of modern Jewish and Holocaust studies at Emory University, is the author of History on Trial: My Day in Court with David Irving. She was the target of a British libel lawsuit by Irving, a historian she said had become a spokesman for Holocaust denial. Lipstadt won the case in April 2000. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers."}
{"original": "Until recently anyone who uttered such a statement would have been deemed mad. This past week, however, Ken Livingstone, former mayor of London and a member of Parliament, did just that, saying Hitler was supporting Zionism while surrounded by reporters and cameras. So far, he seems unwilling to plead insanity or to apologize for his remarks."}
{"original": "PHOTO: Ann Borden Professor Deborah Lipstadt"}
{"original": "The charge that Zionists and Nazis were in cahoots is not new. Holocaust deniers, anti-Israel extremists, and neo-Nazis, but generally not MPs, have long made it. They insist that Zionists and Nazis shared a goal of a Jew-free Europe and a Jewish homeland. Livingstone is both wrong on his history and playing into a dangerous contemporary trend toward vilifying Jews who lived (and struggled to survive) in Hitler's Germany."}
{"original": "04:11 - Source: CNN Israel marks Holocaust Remembrance Day"}
{"original": "This accusation is ludicrous in its historical inaccuracy. Hitler considered a Jewish homeland a threat to humanity. The Nazis believed that the Jews did not need a state, because they were more powerful than any state; the Zionists believed that the Jews needed a state, because they were powerless without one."}
{"original": "It is also completely historically wrong to argue, as Livingstone did, that until Hitler went mad, he was a compatriot of the Jews. Already in Mein Kampf, published in 1925 before he became chancellor in 1933, he warned of a Jewish virus, described Jews as vile and a pestilence, and called for their expulsion from society."}
{"original": "From the outset of the Third Reich under Hitler's leadership, Germany made life difficult for Jews. They were forced out of jobs, physically harassed, and expelled from universities. Their stores were boycotted. Jewish schoolchildren were humiliated. In 1935 the Nuremberg Laws deprived Jews of their citizenship. A relentless propaganda campaign reinforced these legal maneuvers: posters, cartoons, children's books, and newspaper articles depicted Jews as Germany and the world's misfortune."}
{"original": "How do Livingstone and his compatriots hatch this absurd claim? Like other demagogues before them, they twist historical fact beyond reality until it is no longer recognizable."}
{"original": "03:33 - Source: CNN A Holocaust survivor bears witness at trials in Germany"}
{"original": "In Livingstone's case, he has distorted the fact that in August 1933, German Zionists, desperate to help Jews get out of the Reich, concluded the Ha'avara or Transfer agreement, the only formal contract between Nazi Germany and a Zionist organization. Under its provisions, Jews, after paying an increasingly debilitating emigration tax, could deposit a sum of money with the Zionist organization and then, upon arrival in Palestine, use credit on those funds to buy property."}
{"original": "The agreement was of tremendous financial benefit to the Germans, because under the agreement Jewish emigrants often had to forfeit many of their possessions before leaving the country. And it was hardly a negotiation between equals. There was no finding of common ground. The Nazis held the power and the Jews only had ideas to try to blunt the assault directed at them. While no Jews celebrated this interaction with the Nazis, it nonetheless saved approximately 60,000 lives."}
{"original": "So Livingstone credits his knowledge to a book by an American Marxist that is so far outside the historical mainstream as to be dismissed as irrelevant by virtually all Holocaust scholars. The book contends that the Nazis and the Zionists worked in collaboration with one another and that, therefore, Israel has its roots in Nazism with all its attendant evils. One of the few entities to embrace it is the Institute for Historical Review, the home of Holocaust denial activities in the United States."}
{"original": "It's important to note, though, that Livingstone isn't an edge case; his comments are indicative of a broader assault on history that has a contemporary objective: to tarnish the reputations of German Jews and Zionists alike. Today, when Hitler and Nazism are two of the remaining terms about which there is a general sense of opprobrium, to claim that the Zionists worked with the Nazis or, in Livingstone's terms, that Hitler was a Zionist and wanted Jews to go to Israel, which did not even exist at the time, is to link the terms Zionism and Israel with Hitler and Nazism and to generate disgust by association."}
{"original": "05:30 - Source: CNN U.S. Nazi hunter has one active case"}
{"original": "While many people, myself included, may have differences with aspects of Israeli policies, to link Israel with the Third Reich is not only historically farfetched but is also revolting. The notion that the murderers and the victims were working together is so far beyond historical acceptability as to be beyond the pale."}
{"original": "Lenni Brenner, the author of Zionism in the Age of the Dictators, the book to which Livingstone credits all his knowledge on the topic, and these other critics from the left are suggesting that no truly ethical or moral entity would ever have considered cooperating with Hitler. From Livingstone's comfortable position in Westminster and the offices on the university campuses occupied by professors who see Israel and its supporters as the epitome of evil, they all seem to know in their hearts that they, unlike Zionists, would have taken the high road."}
{"original": "If only life were that easy. As a professor of modern Jewish history and Holocaust studies, I know the opposite is true. Toward the end of my course on the history of the Holocaust, I ask my students a question but tell them I don't want an answer. Imagine you are in a ghetto and you have a chance to escape. Do you go? Then I add a caveat. If the Germans discover you have escaped it is likely that your family – parents, younger siblings, grandparents – will be deported to death camps. Do you go or stay? Then I repeat my admonition: Don't answer."}
{"original": "It is impossible, even after a semester of intense study, to truly grasp the horrors Jews endured. Though I generally eschew what if questions and playacting history, I pose this question to instill in my students modesty in judgment, to give them some sense of the terrible conundrums Jews faced."}
{"original": "01:08 - Source: CNN Sanders: Holocaust taught me about political extremism"}
{"original": "My students are told not to answer the question, and I can't answer it either. Had I been given the opportunity to negotiate with the Nazis, would I have done it? I don't know. I might have stood on principle and said no. Then again, thinking about the potential of saving 60,000 Jews and their millions of descendants, I might have shelved my righteous indignation and tried to save lives."}
{"original": "This is what those who designed the Ha'avara agreement managed to do. They should be praised for their actions, not vilified by uninformed onlookers like Livingston in the name of contemporary politics."}

(Update: Citi reported earnings that topped forecasts, but its revenues were lower than what Wall Street was expecting.)"}

{"original": "Last year, bank stocks diverged from the actual business performance."}
{"original": "Banks brought in record profits, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In the third quarter of 2018, FDIC-insured banks reported $62 billion in profit, an all-time high and up nearly 30% compared to the previous year. Both President Donald Trump's corporate tax cuts and the buzzing economy played a role."}
{"original": "But bank shares sagged, trailing the market amid apprehension about what could be coming down the pike. The financial sector (XLF) fell almost 15% in 2018. Comparatively, the Dow fell 5.6%, and the S&P 500 was down 6.2%. JPMorgan Chase, a top performer, dropped about 9% last year."}
{"original": "One reason for worry has been the shrinking difference between short-term and long-term bond yields. Before almost every recent recession, the so-called yield curve has inverted, meaning short-term rates are higher than long-term ones. That indicates investors are not enthusiastic about long-term growth."}
{"original": "The flattening yield curve affects the income banks collect from lending, since banks pay interest on short-term rates and lend at long-term rates. They make money off the difference."}
{"original": "When the banks report this week, Wall Street will likely pay close attention to consumer and business loans. Analysts predict solid loan growth for last quarter. But the segments will be keenly monitored as barometers of economic health."}
{"original": "Steve Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research, noted in a December memo that loan growth has been increasingly sluggish as interest rates have gone up, particularly for auto loans and home loans. Businesses have also cut back on borrowing, he said."}
{"original": "We don't see another surge in commercial real estate that would encourage a lot of borrowing, Cannon said. We see concerns about leveraged lending, which is an area that has grown rapidly. Businesses already have high debt loads, he added."}
{"original": "Last quarter's market volatility could also lead to questions about the pace of mergers and acquisitions and public offerings. Activity in the capital markets can dwindle when they're choppy, which causes banks to lose out on advisory fees. Banks' asset management divisions are also sensitive to market behavior."}
{"original": "While there's plenty of reason to scrutinize bank performance, market watchers aren't exactly worried about their survival."}
{"original": "Regulators have gone to great lengths since the 2008 financial crisis to ensure banks would be on solid footing in the event of another recession. They now mandate that banks maintain certain levels of liquid assets, which can be easily converted to cash to pay off obligations."}
{"original": "Since the financial crisis, liquid assets in the banking system have increased by more than $3 trillion, according to a November report from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Banks have also maintained solid capital levels to cushion any losses, and have largely tried to avoid the sort of risky lending that got them in trouble before."}

{"original": "House GOP lawmakers are preparing to fulfill their promise to repeal Obamacare ... or major portions of it, anyway."}
{"original": "The House will vote on the legislation, called the American Health Care Act, on Thursday. Republican leadership has already made several changes to placate both conservatives and moderates, but a number of members in both chambers remain concerned. So a lot may change before it reaches President Trump's desk."}
{"original": "Critics have ranged from conservative Republicans to insurers to the AARP. Conservatives complain that the bill does not fully repeal Obamacare and that many provisions are too similar to the health reform law. Insurers worry that Republicans would cut federal support for Medicaid and tax credits, leaving many of their customers without coverage. And the AARP fears that Americans in their 50s and early 60s would see their premiums skyrocket and federal assistance reduced, though lawmakers are now promising to provide this group extra assistance."}
{"original": "Proponents of the bill say it would save the individual health market from collapse. The legislation would create a patient-centered health care system that provides Americans more choice, greater control and lower costs, they argue."}

This provision would take effect in 2020."}
{"original": "Provide refundable tax credits based on age and income instead. The Republicans want to issue advanceable refundable tax credits to help people afford coverage on the individual market, but these credits will be based mainly on a person's age. The credits will range from $2,000 for 20-somethings to $4,000 for those in their early 60s. The credits will also have an income cap. Those making more than $75,000 would see their tax credits start to phase out, and an enrollee making more than $215,000 would no longer be eligible. Families with incomes above $150,000 would see their credits dwindle, while those earning more than $290,000 would no longer qualify. This provision would take effect in 2020."}

{"original": "Repeal the individual and employer mandates. The GOP's bill would get rid of the Obamacare requirement that people must have health coverage or face a tax penalty. It would also eliminate the requirement that employers with at least 50 employees provide health insurance to their workers. Under Obamacare, these companies were required to provide affordable insurance to staffers who work more than 30 hours a week. They would face a penalty if they did not meet this criteria and their employee sought subsidies on the exchanges. These provisions take effect retroactively to 2016."}

{"original": "Put in place a continuous coverage requirement instead. The Republican plan seeks to allow insurers to impose a 30% surcharge on the premiums of those who let their coverage lapse for at least 63 days. The plan would enable insurers to levy this surcharge for one year, but it would only apply to policies bought in the individual or small group markets."}
{"original": "Repeal cost-sharing subsidies to lower deductibles and co-pays. The bill would kill the additional help that individuals earning less than roughly $30,000 a year receive to cover their out-of-pocket costs. More than half of the enrollees on the Obamacare exchanges receive these subsidies. This provision would take effect in 2020."}

{"original": "Delay the Cadillac tax. The Republican plan keeps but delays the controversial Cadillac tax, which calls for imposing a 40% excise tax on generous employer health insurance plans. Originally scheduled to go into effect in 2018, the law would have taxed employers on any premiums that exceed $10,200 for individual policies and $27,500 for family plans. After intense lobbying by companies and unions, lawmakers pushed back the start date to 2020. The Republican plan delays it until 2026."}
{"original": "Loosen the age-band so insurers can charge older folks more. Under Obamacare, insurers could only charge older enrollees three times more than younger policy holders. The GOP bill would widen that band to five-to-one, which would hike premiums for those in their 50s and early 60s, but reduce them for younger folks."}

{"original": "Revamp Medicaid funding. The GOP bill would send the states a fixed amount of money per Medicaid enrollee, known as a per-capita cap."}
{"original": "States could also opt to receive federal Medicaid funding as a block grant for the adults and children in their program. Under a block grant, states would get a fixed amount of federal funding each year, regardless of how many participants are in the program."}
{"original": "States, however, cannot opt to receive block grant funding for elderly and disabled participants. Their federal support for those groups would still be based on enrollment."}
{"original": "Either option would limit federal responsibility, shifting that burden to the states. However, since states don't have the money to make up the difference, they would likely either reduce eligibility, curtail benefits or cut provider payments. The block grant would be more restrictive since the funding level would not adjust for increases in enrollment, which often happens in bad economic times."}
{"original": "End enhanced federal funding for Medicaid expansion. It would also end the enhanced match rate for Medicaid expansion for new enrollees starting in 2020. Those already in the program could stay as long as they remain continuously insured. States that have not already expanded would not be allowed to do so, starting immediately."}
{"original": "Allow states to institute work requirement for Medicaid. States would now have the option of requiring able-bodied Medicaid recipients to work, participate in job training programs or do community service. Pregnant women, children under the age of 19, single parents of children under age six and single parents of children with disabilities are exempt."}

{"original": "Give most New York counties relief from Medicaid payments. Lawmakers added a provision that would ban the federal government from reimbursing New York State for Medicaid funds raised by counties outside of New York City. The upstate counties and Long Island send $2.3 billion to the state to help pay for Medicaid. The amendment would give the state the incentive to stop passing down Medicaid costs to the counties, though state officials say it would mean fewer people would be covered and benefits would have to be curtailed."}

{"original": "Restore federal support for hospitals who cover many uninsured patients. The legislation would restore Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital payments in 2018 for states that didn't expand Medicaid and in 2020 for states that did. Under Obamacare, these funds were set to disappear by 2020 since the original law called for all states to expand Medicaid."}
{"original": "Create more generous Health Savings Accounts. Seeking to get more people to save money for health care expenses, the Republican bill includes several provisions aimed at making Health Savings Accounts more attractive. It raises the annual contribution limits to equal the maximum sum of the deductible and out-of-pocket expenses one would pay in a high-deductible insurance plan. So the limit would be at least $6,550 for an individual and $13,100 for a family in 2018."}
{"original": "The bill would also end the Obamacare prohibition on paying for over-the-counter medications with funds from tax-advantaged accounts, such as HSAs and flexible spending accounts. And it reduces the penalty from 20% to 10% if funds from an HSA are used for non-medical purposes. These provisions begin in 2018."}
{"original": "Ban excess tax credits from going into Health Savings Accounts. Enrollees whose tax credits exceed the cost of their premiums would not be able to put the additional funds in Health Savings Accounts. Some conservatives are concerned these funds could be used to pay for abortions."}

{"original": "Lift contribution caps on flexible spending accounts. Obamacare put a cap on annual contributions to flexible spending accounts based on cost of living figures. For 2017, that cap was $2,600. The GOP bill would do away with that limit as of December 31, 2017."}
{"original": "Offer two tax cuts for the wealthy. The bill would eliminate two taxes that Obamacare imposed on the well-to-do to help pay for the law: The 3.8% tax on investment income and the 0.9% Medicare payroll tax on incomes over $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for married couples who file jointly. The provision would take effect in 2017."}

{"original": "Create the patient and state stability fund. This $100 billion fund would be available to the states between 2018 and 2026 for a number of reasons. Among them: offering financial assistance to high-risk patients, reducing the cost of providing coverage in the individual market, promoting access to preventative services as well as dental, vision, mental health and substance abuse services, and helping people reduce their out-of-pocket costs."}
{"original": "Related: These low income kids could lose access to dental care"}
{"original": "Allow insurers to sell plans that cover less of the costs. Obamacare created four tiers of coverage, each with a requirement to cover a certain share of policyholders' costs, on average. The bill would eliminate this rule. Presumably, insurers would be able to offer plans with higher deductibles and co-pays. However, since the legislation does not lift the cap on out-of-pocket expenses, insurers could not require consumers to pay more than that for covered services. The deductibles for many bronze-tier plans are already pegged to that cap."}

{"original": "Retaining out-of-pocket maximums. Under Obamacare, consumers don't have to pay anything after they hit the out-of-pocket maximum for in-network coverage. For 2017, the max is $7,150 for an individual and $14,300 for a family."}

{"original": "Toys R Us is closing its doors after 70 years in business."}
{"original": "It marks the end for a company that sold toys, bikes, video games and birthday presents to millions of American kids. For half a century, Geoffrey the mascot giraffe invited children to its giant playhouses. Legions of adults who came of age in the 1980s and 1990s can probably still whistle the jingle: I'm a Toys 'R' Us kid."}
{"original": "Yet Toys R Us fell victim to the strong currents pulling specialty retailers into oblivion. Walmart, Target and other big-box retailers — stores that offered aisles of toys and everything else, too — began to erode its dominance. And then the emergence of Amazon sped its demise."}
{"original": "Toys R Us will shut or sell all of its 735 stores in the United States, according to court documents filed early Thursday. About 31,000 workers in the United States will be laid off."}
{"original": "In September, Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy, hoping to shed debt and reinvest in its stores. At the time, Toys R Us disclosed that it had about $5 billion in debt and was spending about $400 million a year just to service it."}
{"original": "The turnaround didn't work. In January, the company said it would close 182 stores across the United States."}
{"original": "In a bankruptcy court filing Thursday, Toys R Us said it had a horrific holiday season, well below worst case projections. It earned just $81 million in pre-tax profit in the fourth quarter, $250 million below the company's target and a quarter of what it earned a year earlier."}
{"original": "Do you work at Toys R Us? We want to hear from you"}
{"original": "The company said it would have to spend several hundred million dollars just to keep its remaining stores open through the end of the year. That's a problem because Toys R Us is already burning nearly $100 million per month. Meanwhile, no buyer has come forward to save Toys R Us, and the company acknowledged its creditors are getting antsy."}
{"original": "Toys R Us said it realized its plan to stay in business through the 2018 holiday season wouldn't work."}
{"original": "The stark reality is that the company will run out of cash in the United States in May, the company noted in its filing. So it determined the best way to pay back its creditors is to liquidate the remaining inventory in its remaining US stores."}
{"original": "Everything is up for sale, Toys R Us CEO David Brandon told employees on a conference call Wednesday, according to a recording obtained by CNNMoney. All of these assets are available. Someone can literally buy these assets, and if they are willing to pay one more dollar than the liquidation value of these assets then in fact it could be of interest."}
{"original": "Related: Meet the woman who wrote the Toys 'R' Us jingle"}
{"original": "Toys R Us did not say when it would close the stores, but they will probably stay open for at least two months. The company has filed store closure notices that require a 60-day wait before it can shut them down. Toys R Us also told its 31,000 US employees that they will be laid off."}
{"original": "That's horrible news, but that's the way it is, Brandon said on the call."}
{"original": "The company hopes to remain alive outside the United States. It said many of its stores in Canada, Europe and Asia remain strong, viable businesses, and may be saved or sold. On Wednesday, Toys R Us said it was closing all its stores in the UK."}
{"original": "Toys R Us hopes to sell its much stronger Canadian business and run the company from that country. It is currently based in Wayne, New Jersey."}
{"original": "Brandon said a buyer of the Canadian business could choose to purchase the 200 best-performing US stores and keep them operational. But that's far from certain."}
{"original": "Toys R Us hasn't made a full-year profit since 2012 and has lost $2.5 billion since then. It reported a loss of $953 million in the first nine months of last year alone. Sales during the recent holiday period, which the company has yet to report, are believed to have been very bad."}

{"original": "Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk will unveil the company's first car for the masses Thursday night. Tesla fans who can't afford the Model S, which costs between $70,000 and $140,000, have eagerly awaited this day for years. The Model 3 will be priced at about $35,000."}
{"original": "Tesla will start taking $1,000 deposits from buyers in stores Thursday morning, and online at 10:30 p.m. ET that night, which is when the car will be unveiled."}
{"original": "But there are still more questions than answers about the Model 3. Here's what we do -- and don't -- know about the car."}
{"original": "When can buyers actually get one?"}
{"original": "Tesla expects to start delivering the Model 3 in late 2017. So even if you're one of the first to reserve one, it'll still be a long wait. And ramping up production can take a while, so it could easily be 2018 before even early buyers can get their hands on a car."}
{"original": "The Model 3 will be more like Tesla's Model S sedan than its Model X crossover. But the company has kept the design under wraps. It definitely won't have the distinctive falcon wing doors of the Model X."}
{"original": "How far will it go on a charge?"}
{"original": "The base model Model S has a minimum range of 240 miles, but the Model 3 probably won't go quite as far. The Model 3's battery will be smaller and lighter in order to keep the cost of the car down, and the size of the battery pack is what determines range."}
{"original": "Musk has been quoted as saying 200 miles should be the minimum range for any all-electric car."}
{"original": "At $35,000, the Model 3 will cost about half the price of the base version of the Model S. And buyers will get tax breaks -- there's a $7,500 federal deduction, and some states offer as much as $2,500 in credits. The average price of all new cars today is about $34,000, according to Kelley Blue Book."}
{"original": "Musk said in February that Tesla might hold back on some features for the Model 3 to get the car to market faster, having learned a lesson with the much delayed Model X SUV."}
{"original": "In retrospect, it would have better to do fewer things with the first version of Model X, and then roll in ... new technologies over time, Musk said. I do think that there was some hubris there with the Model X."}
{"original": "Of course, some of the most talked-about Tesla features cost thousands of dollars. If they're available for a Model 3, they could quickly end the car's claim of being a moderately priced for those who add them."}
{"original": "For example, the ludicrous mode that lets the car to go 0 to 60 in only 3 seconds, adds $10,000 to the price of a Model S, and it requires all wheel drive, which adds another $5,000, as well as high performance motors that add $20,000. Autopilot features add another $2,500."}

{"original": "Leading progressives are threatening to reject a rules package backed by Democratic leadership over a requirement they believe could thwart their most ambitious policy plans."}
{"original": "New York Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and California Rep. Ro Khanna said Wednesday they will vote against any guidelines that include a provision known as PAYGO, or pay as you go, which requires that new spending be offset by matching cuts or increases in revenue."}
{"original": "Progressives who support programs like Medicare-for-all and other policies likely to increase government expenditures worry that the rule would create a self-imposed obstacle with limited political upside – and come across as a sign that Democrats are committed to the austerity economics championed, at least rhetorically, by conservative groups."}
{"original": "Opponents of the rule say they would need 18 votes from the Democratic conference to scuttle the rules package, which is otherwise widely popular, and potentially send leadership into negotiations with the progressive holdouts."}
{"original": "I do not understand why the Democrats don't have the courage of our convictions and make the case that our policies will lead to growth, Khanna said, arguing that the rule was ultimately a self-defeating political calculation: PAYGO is to protect members in vulnerable districts who can say that Democrats are for fiscal responsibility. I'm all for raising taxes on the 1% and multinational corporations and stopping our excessive spending on the bad wars. But we should make an economic growth argument in swing districts instead of thinking the '90s playbook of fiscal responsibility will work."}
{"original": "Ocasio-Cortez also said on Wednesday she would vote against the package when it comes up soon after she is sworn in on Thursday."}
{"original": "PAYGO isn't only bad economics, she tweeted, it's also a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare + other leg. We shouldn't hinder ourselves from the start."}
{"original": "Drew Hammill, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, pushed back against Khanna's argument in a tweet of his own."}
{"original": "We must replace CUTGO to allow Democrats to designate appropriate offsets (including revenue increases), Hammill said. A vote AGAINST the Democratic Rules package is a vote to let Mick Mulvaney make across the board cuts, unilaterally reversing Democratic initiatives and funding increases."}
{"original": "CUTGO, a rule put in place by the outgoing Republican House majority, requires new spending be paid for with cuts to spending. Unlike PAYGO, it does not make allowances for revenue increases, which typically come in the form of tax hikes."}
{"original": "There is a PAYGO mechanism within Federal law that requires (the Office of Management and Budget, which is led by Mulvaney) to offset the cost of deficit-increasing legislation by forcing indiscriminate, across-the-board cuts in federal mandatory spending, Hammill added. It's the law of the land."}

{"original": "We all agree that the real problem with PAYGO exists in the statute that requires it. That is why we will be introducing legislation in the 116th Congress to end PAYGO, they said. In the meantime, Chairman McGovern and House Leadership have committed to us that PAYGO will not be an impediment to advancing key progressive priorities in the 116th Congress. With the assurances that PAYGO can be waived, we do plan to vote for the House rules package and proceed with legislation to fix the statute."}
{"original": "Khanna praised the work of Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern, the incoming Rules Committee chairman, who previously struck a deal with progressives that would lower the bar for raising rates on most taxpayers, but Khanna warned that more ambitious steps were needed."}
{"original": "I have a lot of respect for Jim McGovern and there are a lot of good things in the rules package – like allowing members to wear any form of religious garb on the House floor, a diversity office – and other rules about how committees work, he said. But for me, austerity politics has been one of the main reasons the working class has been hurt in our country and the recovery was so slow."}

{"original": "PHOENIX — Oatmeal nearly gone, bacon in hand and another meeting stuffed with pointed questions behind him, the Apple Watch wrapping Tony Clark's wrist beeped with a message: Time to stand."}
{"original": "The late-morning breakfast conversation here in a booth of the swanky hotel restaurant paused as the Major League Players Association executive director stopped to consider the message. The winter has been difficult, and the spring arguably has been worse. The seal on the latest Basic Agreement between the players and owners barely has been broken—the sides are just 15 months into the four-year contract—and yet free agents this past winter stepped into a deep freeze and, even now, a couple dozen remain unsigned. The agitation level is high."}
{"original": "The message on his watch was a simple reminder to the 6'8 Clark at various checkpoints throughout his workday. His back, which he first injured playing basketball at the University of Arizona in the early 1990s and then managed throughout a 15-year MLB career spanning from 1995-2009, has been flaring up this spring along with everything else. Though he wears the pain without complaint, you can see it in the stiff way he walks."}
{"original": "Because Clark is a grinder who tends to keep his head down, blinders on and works through what is in front of him until it is finished, he can use every reminder he can get to pause, stand and stretch his tight and aching back."}
{"original": "But here's the thing: As he led meetings with each of the game's 30 clubs throughout his annual tour of Florida and Arizona camps this spring, what he found was that the messages on his watch were nearly extraneous. Because in conversations with angry and frustrated players, as the deep freeze continued to ice free agents across an MLB landscape featuring an alarming number of clubs veering toward tanking, resetting or rebooting—pick a term—he was buoyed by the sheer number of players delivering the same message as the one that kept beeping on his wrist."}
{"original": "Video Play Button Videos you might like"}
{"original": "The core concerns are resonating, Clark said. Whether it was on the Florida coast or out here in Arizona, players are as connected and as engaged as they've ever been."}
{"original": "Whether it is players speaking among themselves, players speaking to us or us speaking with them. Whether you are a young player who just came in or a seasoned veteran, if it didn't directly affect you, it affected part of your fraternity."}
{"original": "At Texas' camp in Surprise, Arizona, All-Star Adrian Beltre echoed the suggestion of Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen earlier this winter that players soon may have to consider their first strike since 1994-95."}
{"original": "Strike, whatever it might be, we have to stay united and stick together, Beltre said."}
{"original": "It's great to hear those comments, Kansas City outfielder Jon Jay added. Bottom line is, we have to stay united and have each other's backs."}
{"original": "At the Cubs' camp in Mesa, Arizona, All-Star Kris Bryant, the 2016 NL MVP, vowed to study up on issues and prepared to fight for the players."}
{"original": "We lost, Bryant said flatly of the union's failure to nudge the luxury-tax payroll threshold beyond $197 million. But it's a situation we've got to learn from."}
{"original": "I think it's opened a lot of people's eyes in terms of players who are going to speak up a little more and have their voices heard."}
{"original": "At the Dodgers' camp in Glendale, Arizona, starter Alex Wood referenced the eye-opening offseason observation from Seattle GM Jerry Dipoto that from a team's perspective you could argue you're going to compete with more clubs to get the first pick in the draft than you would to win the World Series. And Dipoto is management."}
{"original": "The biggest thing is the integrity of the game, Wood said. Every spring we sit here and listen to Rule 21 about putting forth your best effort individually as players or as a team. And then you sit here and see half the league not putting forth their best effort to put the best product on the field."}
{"original": "It makes you wonder how the commissioner and everyone can hold us to that level of accountability, but then you don't hold the organizations to that level. It makes you wonder about the situation we've gotten ourselves into."}
{"original": "Some five hours earlier, darkness faded around 6:45 a.m. as morning broke across the desert. Inside the white GMC Yukon as it rolled toward a meeting at the Arizona Diamondbacks complex on a chilly, 59-degree dawn, Clark, 45, did not look the part of embattled union boss."}
{"original": "While growing restlessness among players and agents has yielded private complaining and public questions about everything from flaws in the new agreement to Clark's job security, he was as stoic and unruffled as ever."}
{"original": "My focus always has been and will continue to be the players, he said. A lot of the external stuff, I don't get caught up in. I didn't as a player, and I don't now."}
{"original": "That's why sitting down with guys during spring training, asking questions of them, them asking questions of me against the backdrop of all the rhetoric that is out there, what they've heard and what they've been told…being able to do all of that has been really beneficial."}
{"original": "The current Collective Bargaining Agreement was agreed to in November 2016. One of the chief issues since has been the $197 million competitive balance tax (better known as luxury tax) on each club's payroll that this winter effectively acted as a salary cap. Clubs exceeding $197 million for three or more seasons are subject to a 50 percent payroll tax, as opposed to 20 percent (for exceeding it for one year) or 30 percent (for exceeding it a second year). That's no small part of the reason stars such as Eric Hosmer (Padres), J.D. Martinez (Red Sox) and Jake Arrieta (Phillies) went unsigned until after spring training started and why veterans such as Jose Bautista, Melky Cabrera and J.J. Hardy remain unsigned even after Opening Day."}
{"original": "And why Mike Moustakas, after swatting 38 home runs last year and declining Kansas City's one-year, $17.4 million qualifying offer, failed to land a multiyear deal and came crawling back to the Royals this spring on a one-year, $5.5 million deal with $2.2 million in incentives."}
{"original": "This is where Bryant said the players lost in the CBA. Clark and some players prefer patience, saying that this agreement is just 15 months old and still needs to play out because there are no significant changes in this CBA versus the old one."}
{"original": "That reset has been a part of the last three agreements, Clark said. It's not new. Now…if they aren't rebooting and they are treating it as if that is the threshold to end all thresholds, then we're having a different conversation."}
{"original": "Clark continued: And so the question for us is whether or not it is a reboot or a hard stop. If it is a hard stop for those teams or for any number of other teams, then we're in a different world."}
{"original": "One of the biggest criticisms of the players union is that while it negotiated increases to the payroll threshold, they weren't enough. From 2014-16, the CBT threshold on player payrolls was $189 million. The current CBA calls for increases over each of the next five years to an eventual $210 million in 2021."}
{"original": "First instituted in 2003, the CBT is an attempt to level the playing field—at least to a degree—between smaller-market clubs and Goliaths like the Yankees, Dodgers and Red Sox. But with MLB revenues reaching record proportions of more than $10 billion in 2017, there are those who believe the gap between the CBT threshold and each club's individual record revenues has become so great that clubs now are incentivized to protect their record revenues—from TV rights, sponsorships, etc.—in no small part because the threshold is too low."}
{"original": "Obviously, you want the threshold as high as it can be, Clark said. The CBT has been around for 20 years. We know there are some teams that historically respond to it one way, and we know there have been other teams that have responded to it a completely different way. And we know the vast majority of the league is not affected by it because they're not close enough to it."}
{"original": "So the question becomes are teams changing how they are viewing it, and how are they viewing it? That would have less to do with the changes that were made and more to do with a fundamental shift in their philosophy."}
{"original": "As clubs change the way they value players and skew younger, membership is on guard. The union this winter filed a grievance against four clubs—Pittsburgh, Miami, Tampa Bay and Oakland—accusing them of failing to properly spend revenue-sharing money. This is a first. The union in the past has only threatened grievances against clubs it felt were not complying with their end of the revenue-sharing stream—Miami and Pittsburgh—and the simple threat led to productive discussions with the offenders."}
{"original": "It's one thing not to look to sign a number of guys, Clark said. But it is another piece of that puzzle when you are taking remarkably talented guys and moving them off of your roster and onto other rosters in an effort to try to create that atmosphere of a race to the bottom."}
{"original": "There is even clubhouse chatter that some players—including some of the game's top stars—may boycott some interviews with MLB Network television this summer, viewing the network as an extension of the owners with whom they are angry."}
{"original": "Some of the overall anger is being stoked by the players' representatives, many of whom are on the phone regularly venting to Clark. On Feb. 2, agent Brodie Van Wagenen fired this salvo on Twitter, writing that there is a rising tide among players for radical change."}
{"original": "Anytime you speak to a group of representatives who have been around for a while and they suggest we have never seen this, we have never heard this, Clark said, antennas pop."}
{"original": "Exiting the SUV, Clark stretched and cleared his mind in the parking lot—time to stand—before walking inside for what will be close to a two-hour meeting with the Diamondbacks and members of his staff."}
{"original": "Clark is the first ex-player to lead the union. This makes him an easy target for criticism."}
{"original": "I'm different than those who came before me, but my reference points in protecting players are the same, Clark said."}
{"original": "He was the handpicked choice of his predecessor, Michael Weiner, who died in November 2013, following a protracted battle with brain cancer. Weiner was an attorney, as was Don Fehr, the union boss from 1985-2009. Before them, the first head of the players' union, starting in 1966, was Marvin Miller, who was an economist for the International Association of Machinists, United Auto Workers and United Steelworkers."}
{"original": "For Clark, accepting Weiner's offer was the culmination of two decades of involvement in union labor issues. He started as the Detroit Tigers' player representative in 1997, just his second full season in the majors. His interest was piqued when he spent a full day at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, when he was in the Class A New York-Penn League in the early 1990s. He spent most of his time that day in the Negro Leagues area of the museum, which, he said, helped me understand, as a black player, the opportunity I had and the responsibility that I had."}
{"original": "He saw that day the history of those who came before him and helped clear a path for him. And he understood that if he ever made it to the majors, it would come with the responsibility for doing the same for those who came after him."}
{"original": "By 2002, Clark moved from the player representative position to an American League Representative, a higher-ranking and more involved executive board post."}
{"original": "Shortly after his retirement as a player following the 2009 season, Clark accepted Weiner's invitation for a full-time executive board position."}
{"original": "That's the role I anticipated having until Michael rode into the sunset, Clark said. When he did, I would as well. Unfortunately, a couple of years later he's diagnosed with a brain tumor, and we lose him a couple of years after that."}
{"original": "Lines between management and labor were clear when Clark came up as a young player: The 1994-95 strike at the time was the fifth work stoppage in 22 years, and it was the mother of them all, lasting 232 days, longest in MLB history. Clark debuted as a rookie for the Tigers late in the '95 season after the players came back earlier that spring."}
{"original": "I was very fortunate to come into the game when I did, surrounded by the player leadership that I was, Clark said. And how that's shaped my perspective of the game on the field, in the industry, off of it and my responsibilities inherent within it."}
{"original": "It is the players, he emphasized, who drive the strategies. It is their union. His job simply is to understand their disposition on the issues and make judgments accordingly. And as Clark made the rounds this spring, he sensed strengthening resolve from a new generation of players who are fed up with what they view as the owners' duplicity following a long era of peace."}
{"original": "He hints at a coming intellectual arms race, conceding that the union is planning to increase its heft, noting that adding talent and expertise in a number of areas—including legal and communications—is something we're looking at."}
{"original": "The CBA gets thicker and thicker, he continued. How we function as an organization both now and moving forward has to adapt."}
{"original": "Frustrated as some players are, some of the rhetoric is a little—or a lot—overheated."}
{"original": "For one thing, because players are in the middle of a negotiated contract, it is illegal for them to strike. That would have to wait until the current agreement expires after the '21 season."}
{"original": "Another is the idea that, in the last talks, the union fumbled some key issues such as payroll tax thresholds and compensatory draft picks tied to free agency to win luxury items such as extra seats on the team bus and a chef in every clubhouse. While it is true that the players wanted—and ultimately won—the bus and chef items, the union says that to portray negotiating away the big stuff in exchange for those luxury items is absurd."}
{"original": "That's one of the most ridiculous things I heard all offseason, Clark said. Sure, there are things that didn't exist before [such as the chefs]. But it did not come at the expense of not paying attention to the other pieces. Any number of folks are going to look at any number of items differently."}
{"original": "Those who are trying to keep score likely haven't been in a bargaining room."}
{"original": "Bottom line is, certain items are shut-down-the-game issues. While the players are getting killed now for not forcing the luxury-tax threshold higher, until this current agreement they were doing just fine in free agency as MLB hit record revenues."}
{"original": "There were no egregious wrongs to right."}
{"original": "Ideally, we want everybody to get to free agency earlier and we want the competitive balance tax to be incredibly high, Andrew Miller, the Cleveland reliever and a key union figure as an association representative, said. But the reality is you have to negotiate these things and find a way to make them work for you. The game is in a really good place, and the agreement didn't actually change that much from 2011 to 2016."}
{"original": "To say this hasn't worked the way we envisioned I think would be fair. But to say it's a failure, I don't think that's fair."}
{"original": "As for the luxury items criticism, Miller said: Players get engaged in that because it's something we know and can relate to. The reality is, a lot of the big stuff, we trust economists and lawyers on that. They drive that conversation. Certainly, players are engaged in on-field issues, whether it's pace of play, things to do with uniforms, things we understand."}
{"original": "But the reality is, we didn't sacrifice anything in draft-pick compensation to let guys wear cleats they want to wear. That's misinformed and disingenuous, and I get frustrated when I read that and hear that. It's just wrong."}
{"original": "Spring is the time of renewal, and whether cacti or palm trees fill the landscape outside the windows—and from the inside of Clark's GMC Yukon as we departed the Diamondbacks camp and rode toward breakfast, it's both—this year, renewal is a loaded word."}
{"original": "Several players and even a few union officials recalled former Commissioner Bud Selig's mantra, that all MLB markets should contain hope and faith heading into each Opening Day. While that always was a naive goal (see: Cleveland, from about 1969-93, among many other clubs), never before has the game seen this sort of behavior by so many clubs looking long term instead of short term."}
{"original": "Everything about the CBA is grounded in the ability for teams to compete every year, Clark said. Whether it's revenue sharing, how those dollars are distributed, the flexibility in the system on how to use those dollars, it was always done against the backdrop of each team doing everything it can with the resources it has to put itself in a position to be the last team standing."}
{"original": "When there are professed interests by upwards of a third of the clubs [to rebuild instead of compete in 2018], if some of what we're seeing and hearing is to be believed, that's a concern. It's a concern because we all have a vested interest in the excitement around Opening Day, around the excitement, around the possibilities that exist because the ball does bounce funny ways sometimes. And so when that many teams say, intimate or suggest a salary dump, you just hope there isn't an adverse effect on the industry as a whole."}
{"original": "Said Miller: It's easy to see why these organizations want to copy what the Cubs and Astros did. I don't think either side, players or owners, ever thought in the offseason of 2017-2018 it would be acceptable to the fans to tank. But now it's not hard to go read a message board or look at comments on FanGraphs or TradeRumors when the Pirates or Rays start dumping guys and seeing that people are OK with rebuilds. … I don't think we saw that coming, and it needs to be addressed."}
{"original": "A big test will come next winter when high-impact free agents Bryce Harper, Manny Machado, Josh Donaldson and others—Clayton Kershaw, if he opts out of his contract—come onto the market. It is possible that the Yankees, Dodgers and others sat out this winter's free-agent market in anticipation of that. And it's among the reasons Cleveland's Miller said he is taking a bigger-picture view than many others."}
{"original": "Free agency is supposed to be a reward for players who have paid their dues, and it didn't work this year. That does not mean this deal is bad or irredeemable. We have to wait and see, and we have to make it work for us. The unfortunate thing is the players who do get caught [waiting for a contract]."}
{"original": "Miller has worked as closely with Clark as anyone and has no doubts that Clark is the right man to lead the players."}
{"original": "It's not like there are people out there just walking down the street who are ready to become the executive director of a sports union. The reality is those people are hard to find."}
{"original": "When we went through that process, Michael [Weiner] was a big part of it. And as much as we love Michael, his recommendation was Tony."}
{"original": "There's always going to be growing pains. The reality is ... I think he's done a great job. Things aren't always going to go your way. Things aren't always going to be sunshine and rainbows. … We have to find a way to get through all this, and I think he's the right guy."}
{"original": "Clark, who took the position over several other opportunities within the game—broadcasting, coaching, managing and front office work—said he made this move because he felt it would connect him to former, current and future fraternity members. There was no other job or opportunity that provided that significant a touch point for the group that I was most concerned about or believed in the most."}
{"original": "Since taking the top job, Clark hasn't even paused for a vacation. Too many responsibilities keep him tethered to the union's 1,200 members. He'll steal a three-day weekend here or a day there when he feels the walls closing in, and he makes sure to be home each afternoon in time to see his son's basketball or baseball game. In addition to his son Aeneas, who is 15 and plays shortstop and third base, Tony and his wife, Frances, also have two older daughters, Kiara, 23, and Jazzin, 20."}
{"original": "Bottom line is, he knows what he's gotten into, said former infielder Damion Easley, whose family is so close with Clark's that they were neighbors in Phoenix for several years until the Clarks moved to New Jersey when Tony became the union chief. It's a borderline thankless job; it really is. It's hard to please everyone. You've got different spectrums or players; you try to do the best job you can for each level of player."}
{"original": "He still exercises when he can—bike, treadmill, weights, some jogging—but especially at this time of year, spring tour in full force, that time too often disappears into the hours sitting in planes, cars and meetings."}
{"original": "I'm holding on for dear life, he quipped. If you give me truth serum, or even if you don't, there are times when I sure don't feel like a professional athlete."}
{"original": "By the time the current labor deal expires, there will have been 26 consecutive seasons uninterrupted by work stoppages, dating all the way back to when Clark played. It is the longest run of labor peace since the MLBPA became a recognized union in 1966."}
{"original": "As for where things go from here, well, it's all part of what Clark jokes is turning my gray to silver, quick. And while he concedes that some days are more challenging than others, Clark presses onward, viewing his position as more of a calling than a job."}
{"original": "Every player, whether I know him or not, or have direct interaction with him or not, is personal to me, Clark said. So being in this … that's an easy one."}
{"original": "With that, he glances at his wrist. Morning has slipped into afternoon, and he's due at the airport to pick up his wife."}
{"original": "But first, as he lifts himself out of the booth … it is time to stand."}

{"original": "The words best Toyota Prius ever might not sound that exciting when gas prices are so low. I might as well sell you about the best winter parka ever in the middle of July, right?"}
{"original": "The new Toyota Prius Prime plug-in hybrid could actually generate some buzz, even now. Sales of plug-in hybrids, while still only about half a percent of all car sales in America are climbing, according to Edmunds.com,"}
{"original": "Plug-in hybrids offer the coolness of hi-tech driving with the security of being able to rely on easily accessible fossil fuels when you need to. And, thanks to more powerful packs, they offer more exciting performance than plug-free hybrids."}
{"original": "The Prius Prime goes about 25 miles before it starts running like a regular Prius hybrid on both gasoline and electricity that it generates itself. And, with those more powerful batteries, the Prius Prime gets an EPA-estimated 54 mpg when driving on gasoline, much better than the competing Chevrolet (GM) Volt's 42 mpg. (Chevy goes more than twice as far on electricity alone, though.)"}
{"original": "And Toyota designers made this car look different -- and better -- than your standard Prius. Up front, the Prius Prime gets cool LED headlights that make it look, actually, kind of aggressive. Aggressive is not a word usually used to describe Priuses, by the way."}
{"original": "In back, designers added a bigger wing with an integrated taillight along its edge. Together with the lights at the outer corners it creates track of red light at the back of the car. The back window is also made from interesting curved glass with a sunken channel running down the middle. It's an interesting look, but with the downside that the Prius Prime doesn't have a rear wiper like other hatchbacks. The dip in the center makes that window un-wipable."}
{"original": "Inside, the Prius Prime has the nicest interior I've seen in a Toyota (TM). That, in itself, isn't saying a whole lot since, in my experience, Toyota designers have never seemed to sweat interiors that much."}
{"original": "But you can tell that talented people expended real thought on the inside of this car. The top-level model I tested had a lovely white-and-black interior with a huge touch-sensitive central screen. And that screen, in addition to looking good, worked nicely. It was responsive and easy to figure out."}
{"original": "Then there's the way the Prius Prime drives. Now, I realize that talking about the way any Prius drives is a bit like like talking about the taste of a vitamin supplement. It's just not a selling point. But the new Prius, even the non-plug-in version, actually drives pretty well. It's not amazing. It's not quite really fun. But it's close."}
{"original": "Steering feedback is surprisingly good. The Prius Prime wobbles a bit in turns, but not unpleasantly so. The brakes work well and smoothly. I actually felt completely in control and that is, after all, what one wants to feel in any car. It's not exactly fast but, in Power mode the Prius Prime feels responsive, even a little punchy."}
{"original": "Thanks to a $4,500 plug-in car tax credit -- as long as it's still around -- the Prius Prime, at a starting price of $27,000, doesn't even have to cost more than a regular no-plug Prius. Given all you get, I'd say it's well worth the price even if you never plug it in at all."}
{"original": "Sen. Kamala Harris' unique biography and unlikely political ascent might have been summed up best by a political strategist who incorrectly predicted her defeat in the 2010 California attorney general's race."}
{"original": "There was no way I could win, Harris writes in her new memoir, recalling the strategist's stinging words, because I was 'a woman running for attorney general, a woman who is a minority, a woman who is a minority who is anti-death penalty who is DA of wacky San Francisco.' Old stereotypes die hard."}
{"original": "Harris did win that race (barely) and is now poised for another steep and daunting climb – this time a potential quest for the Democratic presidential nomination in what might become the most diverse and seasoned field of presidential candidates in the party's history."}
{"original": "In a twist of fate, what one strategist viewed as her vulnerabilities – her gender, her race and the interrogation skills she developed as a prosecutor – may now be what sets her apart in the 2020 crowd."}
{"original": "The California senator's memoir publishing Tuesday, The Truths We Hold, lays the groundwork by chronicling Harris' journey as the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica who grew up with a stroller-eye view of the civil rights movement and was educated in the black intellectual circles of Oakland and Berkeley in the 1960s and early 1970s."}
{"original": "The book is a rallying cry against what Harris views as the un-American policies of the Trump administration, alongside her set of policy alternatives. She casts herself as a champion for everyday Americans against the powerful, and she is unsparing in her disdain for the policies of President Donald Trump. She notes that after her own victory speech in 2016, she watched the returns with her husband in a state of shock, eating an entire family-size bag of classic Doritos. Didn't share a single chip."}
{"original": "I did know this: one campaign was over but another was about to begin, Harris writes. This time, a battle for the soul of our nation."}
{"original": "In the years since, she continues, we've seen an administration align itself with white supremacists at home and cozy up to dictators abroad; rip babies from their mothers' arms in grotesque violation of their human rights; give corporations and the wealthy huge tax cuts while ignoring the middle class; derail our fight against climate change; sabotage health care and imperil a woman's right to control her own body; all while lashing out at seemingly everything and everyone, including the very idea of a free and independent press. We're better than this."}
{"original": "The memoir is also her most personal account to date of her exploration of her own heritage, her path to becoming a progressive prosecutor and her brushes with sexism as a woman in the male-dominated spheres of law and politics."}
{"original": "She will launch a media blitz Tuesday with appearances on ABC's Good Morning America and The View, followed by a late night interview later this week with CBS' Stephen Colbert and a series of talks about her book in Washington D.C., New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Her announcement about a presidential run is expected toward the end of this month."}
{"original": "For many years in California, Harris recoiled from questions about her personal life, which helped establish her image as a disciplined and cautious politician. Her first book, Smart on Crime, reflected that private veneer with its narrow focus on policy, drawing from her experience prosecuting crimes that ranged from child sexual assault to homicide in Alameda County and San Francisco."}
{"original": "In the new book, Harris delves far more deeply into her upbringing by a single mother who was determined to see that she and her sister Maya would grow into confident, proud black women. A mother, Harris writes, who taught them to be tough and rarely offered praise for behavior or achievements that were expected."}
{"original": "Harris stitches together touchstones from her childhood – like her mother's pride in finally saving enough money to buy a home when Harris was in high school – with stories about her work as California's attorney general pursuing predatory lenders and holding out for a larger settlement from the big banks after the foreclosure crisis."}
{"original": "Noting her self-doubt during that period as California held out for what ultimately became a $20 billion settlement, Harris recalled a tart message from then-Gov. Jerry Brown – I hope you know what you're doing – as well as a tense meeting with top officials at the big banks who seemed to be under the misimpression that I could be bullied into submission, she writes."}
{"original": "In one dramatic moment, she describes how she engaged in a shouting match with Jamie Dimon, the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase."}
{"original": "I was tired of feeling caged, of talking through lawyers and other intermediaries in endless obfuscation, Harris writes of her decision to call Dimon directly. I took off my earrings (the Oakland in me) and picked up the receiver."}
{"original": " 'You're trying to steal from my shareholders!' he yelled, almost as soon as he heard my voice. I gave it right back, Harris writes."}
{"original": " 'Your shareholders? Your shareholders? My shareholders are the homeowners of California! You come and see them. Talk to them about who got robbed.' It stayed at that level for a while. We were like dogs in a fight. A member of my senior team later recalled thinking, 'This was either a really good or a colossally bad idea.'  (The settlement was reached two weeks later)."}
{"original": "In a series of stories, Harris explains how the people she met as a prosecutor, and later as attorney general, steered her agenda in the Senate toward criminal justice revisions, legal protections for immigrants, boosting wages for the middle class and advocating for universal health care and for lowering the cost of prescription drugs."}
{"original": "She notes a career high point in performing gay weddings in California after the Supreme Court struck down Proposition 8, the 2008 California ballot measure that prohibited marriages for same-sex couples. (Like Brown, who served as attorney general before her, Harris refused to defend Proposition 8 in the courts)."}
{"original": "Walking out of the Supreme Court after watching oral arguments in the case, Harris notes that day underscored her rationale for becoming a lawyer: It was in the courtroom, I believed, that you could translate that passion into action and precedent and law."}
{"original": "The most interesting passages of the book often tie back to Harris' family heritage and the values instilled in her by her mother, who separated from Harris' father when she was young."}
{"original": "Harris describes her focus on immigration as a senator – including her efforts to drill Trump officials like former Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly on protections for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and children crossing the border – as being shaped by watching her mother's experience of being a target as an immigrant in America."}
{"original": "I saw it, and it made me mad, Harris writes. I have too many memories of my brilliant mother, a breast cancer researcher who migrated from India to go to graduate school, being treated as though she were dumb because of her accent. Memories of her being followed around a department store with suspicion, because surely a brown-skinned woman like her couldn't afford the dress or the blouse she had chosen."}
{"original": "At times, Harris reveals a more vulnerable side that she rarely shows in public. She notes, for example, her shock and horror when she failed the California Bar on her first try, and how she almost didn't notice that her now-husband was proposing marriage because she was so caught up in what she calls the balancing act of the working woman."}
{"original": "She describes her nervousness changing into jeans and Chuck Taylors before she was introduced to her stepson and stepdaughter. She explains the Momala descriptor on her Twitter handle as the name she and the kids settled on because of their dislike of the word stepmom."}
{"original": "There are also relatable moments when she describes her anguish at missing sports matches and family milestones as she tried to balance her home life with her job in Washington."}
{"original": "For now, she writes that her centering ritual is the tradition of a Sunday gathering of friends and family."}
{"original": "As long as I'm making Sunday family dinner, she writes, I know I'm in control of my life."}

{"original": "China has increasingly become a critical part of Tesla's global strategy, with CEO Elon Musk once calling its factory there a template for future growth."}
{"original": "In 2019, the company beat its own deadline to start making cars in China, kicking off trial production only 10 months after it broke ground on the plant. That boosted confidence that the company had the ability to hit delivery targets as it grew."}
{"original": "Tesla has said that the initial goal for the Shanghai factory is to make 250,000 cars a year, before ramping up to 500,000 units. It revealed last October that it had hit that first goal, while continuing to expand capacity significantly."}
{"original": "The company was also the first foreign automaker to be allowed to open a factory in the country without a Chinese partner, putting pressure on local players."}
{"original": "Tesla previously won a tax break for some of its cars, which helped make its prices more attractive to customers. It also lowered the price of its Model 3 to qualify for government subsidies."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama showed Thursday night that they have more common ground than differences when it comes to making national service a priority in their presidential administrations."}
{"original": "The presidential canidates put aside partisan politics as the nation remembers the terrorist attacks."}
{"original": "The candidates took the stage separately in a forum sponsored by TIME at Columbia University in New York."}
{"original": "A coin toss determined who took questions first from moderators TIME Managing Editor Rick Stengel and PBS's Judy Woodruff."}
{"original": "Asked why it seems the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, are fading in the minds of many Americans, McCain said:"}
{"original": "We needed at that time [September 11, 2001] to take advantage of the unity in the United States of America."}
{"original": "McCain criticized the Bush administration for not taking advantage of that sense of unity and instead imploring the American public to live their lives as usual and go shopping."}
{"original": "I would have called them to serve, said McCain."}
{"original": "The GOP candidate said he suspects people feel uninspired by leaders in Washington and that Americans want change in federal government."}
{"original": "They understand the challenges that we have in this world. They see the Russian invasion of the little country called Georgia. They see the problems in Afghanistan growing larger. They see a whole lot of things happening in the world that's going to require us to serve, and that opportunity has to be provided to them. Watch McCain talk about service »"}
{"original": "McCain praised the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps, saying they and similar organizations don't receive sufficient recognition from Washington. But McCain was careful to say government should limit its involvement. Asked about compensation for service McCain said:"}
{"original": "I'd be glad to reward [volunteers] them as much as possible. But you want to be careful that the reason is not the reward of financial or other reasons, but the reward is the satisfaction of serving a cause greater than yourself. ... Finding new ways to serve. That's what this next few years should be all about."}
{"original": "McCain also fielded a question about his running mate Gov. Sarah Palin's dismissive comments about Sen. Barack Obama's community service in Illinois."}
{"original": "Look, Gov. Palin was responding to the criticism of her inexperience and her job as a mayor in a small town. That's what she was responding to. Of course I respect community organizers. Of course I respect people who serve their community. And Sen. Obama's record there is outstanding."}
{"original": "McCain also said that politics is tough business, and that Obama set the tone of the whole campaign when he refused to take part in town hall meetings with McCain across America."}
{"original": "Obama said his views don't necessarily differ from McCain's on national service."}
{"original": "He said creating opportunities for national service would be a priority for his administration as well."}
{"original": "Part of what makes America work is the fact that we believe in individual responsibility and self-reliance, but we also believe in mutual responsibility, in neighborliness, in a sense that we are committed to something larger than ourselves."}
{"original": "Obama cited a plan to provide college tuition aid in return for student community service."}
{"original": "One of my central platforms in this campaign is we're going to provide a $4,000 tuition credit every student, every year, but in exchange for giving something back. And so, young people of modest means, who are interested in going to college, this gives them an opportunity to serve and at the same time, pay for their college education. I think there are a lot of creative ways where we can provide opportunities than exist right now."}
{"original": "Obama also said he wants to attract more young people into civil service careers."}
{"original": "The fact is that we have to have government. When a hurricane strikes, as it did with Katrina, we have to have a FEMA that works, which by the way, means that we should be encouraging young people, the best and the brightest, to get involved as civil servants, to pursue careers of public service so we've got people who are trained in federal emergency management who are able to take on the job. Watch Obama talk about service »"}
{"original": "Now, that does not crowd out the Red Cross. That doesn't crowd out the thousands of church groups that went down there. What it means is that each area has a role to play."}
{"original": "The forum is part of a two-day summit meant to promote national service. Nearly 500 leaders from business, foundations, universities and politics are meeting to celebrate the power and potential of citizen service and lay out a plan to address America's greatest social challenges through expanded opportunities for volunteer and national service, according to the organizers' Web site."}
{"original": "Each presidential candidate has served his nation in different ways. McCain was a Navy officer for over two decades and often encourages Americans to serve a cause greater than oneself."}
{"original": "Obama served as a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago after he graduated from college. In a speech in December, the Illinois Democrat said he would ask Americans to serve if he becomes president. This will be the cause of my presidency, he said."}
{"original": "Today's joint appearance came amid recent sniping between the campaigns."}
{"original": "McCain's campaign recently attacked Obama for lipstick remarks made during a campaign stop in Virginia on Tuesday."}
{"original": "John McCain says he's about change too, and so I guess his whole angle is, 'Watch out George Bush -- except for economic policy, health care policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy and Karl Rove-style politics -- we're really going to shake things up in Washington,'  he said."}
{"original": "That's not change. That's just calling ... the same thing something different. You know you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. You know you can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change, it's still going to stink after eight years. We've had enough of the same old thing. Watch how tensions are rising on the trail »"}
{"original": "The crowd erupted in applause when Obama delivered the line. McCain's campaign said Obama's remarks were offensive and a slap at vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, despite the fact that the Arizona senator himself used the phrase last year to describe a policy proposal of Hillary Clinton's."}
{"original": "Obama shot back Wednesday and accused the McCain campaign of engaging in lies and swift boat politics."}
{"original": "I don't care what they say about me. But I love this country too much to let them take over another election with lies and phony outrage and swift boat politics, he said in Norfolk, Virginia. Enough is enough. Watch Obama deliver his harsh words »"}
{"original": "The phrase swift boat comes from the 2004 presidential election, when the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth launched an attack ad campaign against Democratic candidate John Kerry that was said by some to be false."}
{"original": "But the two presidential candidates agreed to put aside partisan politics on Thursday. They appeared together in New York to lay a wreath at ground zero, where the World Trade Center towers collapsed after two airliners hijacked by al Qaeda operatives plowed into them on September 11, 2001."}
{"original": "The two met with families of victims as well as state and local officials."}
{"original": "Earlier in the day, McCain attended a ceremony in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, to remember those who lost their lives when United Airlines Flight 93 crashed in a field there on September 11, 2001. Many believe that the hijackers intended to crash Flight 93 into the U.S. Capitol in Washington."}
{"original": "Hundreds, if not thousands, of people at work in that building, when that fateful moment occurred, could have been destroyed along with a beautiful symbol of our freedom, McCain said. They -- and possibly I -- owe our lives to the passengers who summoned the courage and love necessary to deprive our depraved and hateful enemies their terrible triumph."}
{"original": "I've had the great honor and privilege to witness great courage and sacrifice for America's sake, he said."}
{"original": "The Obama campaign released a statement earlier Thursday for its candidate in which he said, We will never forget those who died."}
{"original": "On 9/11, Americans across our great country came together to stand with the families of the victims, to donate blood, to give to charity, and to say a prayer for our country, Obama said. Let us renew that spirit of service and that sense of common purpose."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, a CNN poll out Thursday suggests that voters view McCain as the better presidential candidate to handle terrorism but do not consider terrorism their primary concern in voting."}
{"original": "Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed, 62 percent, believe that the Republican presidential nominee would be the better candidate to handle the issue of terrorism, compared with 34 percent who believe that his Democratic rival, Obama, would be better on the issue."}

{"original": "It's getting harder for ISIS to finance its war machine, due to its shrinking territory and crippled oil business."}
{"original": "ISIS' monthly revenue has fallen by 30% in recent months, according to information and analysis firm IHS. In March, the group collected only $56 million, a significant reduction from estimated monthly revenue of $80 million in mid-2105."}
{"original": "The decline in revenue is now seriously constraining the ISIS' ability to fund its reign of terror, according to the U.S. State Department and several scholars who track the group."}
{"original": "Already, ISIS has been forced to cut its fighters' salaries in half. Additional pressure is now forcing ISIS to ration medical supplies, according to counterterrorism analysts."}
{"original": "It's a major change for a group that became the world's richest terrorist organization by taxing the people on its territory, selling oil on the black market, smuggling stolen archeological artifacts, and demanding kidnapping ransoms."}
{"original": "CNN last month reported that ISIS was struggling financially, but it was unclear to what extent. Now there's evidence ISIS is taking major steps to compensate."}
{"original": "ISIS has ceded 22% of its territory to Kurdish, Syrian and Iraqi forces over the past 15 months, according to IHS. During that time, the population living under ISIS rule has fallen from 9 million to 6 million."}
{"original": "There are fewer people and business activities to tax. The same applies to properties and land to confiscate, said Columb Strack, a senior analyst at IHS."}
{"original": "Tax revenue, which provides roughly half of the group's funding, has fallen by 23% since last summer, IHS reports. As a result, ISIS is desperately finding new ways to squeeze money out of the people still living in its territory."}
{"original": "We already know the group imposes a 10% income tax, 15% business tax, 2% sales tax and 5% fee on cash withdrawals from banks. There's also a mafia-like protection insurance, called jizyah, that Christians are forced to pay."}
{"original": "New rules require anyone who repairs a broken satellite dish to pay ISIS a special fee. People must also pay a religious fine if they are unable to accurately answer questions about the Quran, IHS analysts said."}
{"original": "ISIS is so strapped for cash it has also started giving people accused of violating Sharia law the option of paying a cash fine instead of suffering severe physical punishments, IHS reports."}
{"original": "This new stance represents a strong indicator of the financial difficulties the group is going through, Ludovico Carlino, senior analyst at IHS, wrote in his latest report."}
{"original": "More air strikes, less ISIS oil"}
{"original": "The U.S.-led coalition bombing campaign is also hurting ISIS' oil business, according to IHS."}
{"original": "Revenue from crude sales is down 26% from last year, IHS reports. And daily production in the region has dropped from 33,000 barrels last summer to 21,000 barrels."}
{"original": "Crude oil sales account for 42% of ISIS' revenue, but experts said the group has not raised the price it charges smugglers at the wellhead."}
{"original": "Carlino said ISIS cares more about quick sales -- even if that means lower revenue. Plus, many people inside its territory -- who buy ISIS oil -- are running short of spending money."}
{"original": "The terrorist group is also having trouble recruiting engineers and repair its oil and gas equipment, according to Jean-Charles Brisard, chairman of the Center for the Analysis of Terrorism."}
{"original": "These reasons also explain why ISIS is dedicating large resources to expand itself, notably in Libya, Brisard said."}
{"original": "Even though Libya is 1,400 miles southwest of the ISIS stronghold between Iraq and Syria, experts say the terrorist group is now shifting resources to take advantage of poorly policed coastlines in the region."}

{"original": "A total of 12.2 million people signed up for Obamacare for 2017, about half a million less than a year ago, the Trump administration announced Wednesday."}
{"original": "The drop in enrollment comes as the administration and Republican leaders began working to repeal the sweeping health reform law, saying it was on the verge of collapse. The Department of Health and Human Services pulled ads promoting sign-ups in the crucial final days of open enrollment in January."}
{"original": "But even before the election, Obamacare was plagued by a steep 22% increase in premiums for this year and a sizable reduction in the number of insurers offering plans in the marketplaces. President Trump and Republicans repeatedly pointed to these problems throughout the enrollment period."}

Several states that run their own exchanges also sought to increase enrollment."}
{"original": "Enrollment, which isn't final until consumers pay their first month's premium, typically drops during the year as participants stop making payments or find coverage elsewhere. The Obama administration had expected 13.8 million people to sign up by the end of open enrollment on January 31 and an average of 11.4 million people to be enrolled during 2017."}

{"original": "It's been nearly a year since cash-strapped GE revealed plans to sell the struggling light bulb business and focus instead on moneymakers like jet engines and MRI machines."}
{"original": "But GE (GE) has yet to find a taker for the iconic unit. The company is in active discussions with potential suitors for the lighting division, CEO John Flannery told analysts during a conference call last month."}
{"original": "However, no concrete deal has been reached yet. Even as GE has moved forward with sales of other storied businesses like the 111-year-old rail division, the company declined to provide CNNMoney this week with an update on efforts to sell GE Lighting."}
{"original": "The struggle to sell the light bulb unit underscores the dim outlook for the lighting industry that GE and the conglomerate's cofounder Thomas Edison pioneered."}
{"original": "GE's lighting sales plunged by 59% last year to just under $2 billion. Although lighting long defined GE, today it's the company's tiniest division, accounting for less than 2% of its $122 billion in annual revenue. GE has decided to shift focus onto three core areas: healthcare, power and aviation."}
{"original": "The lighting slump isn't special to GE, which has also been grappling with troubles in its insurance, power and transportation businesses. It's an industrywide problem driven by low prices and the popularity of LED lights that last for decades, limiting the need to replace them."}
{"original": "It has not been a particularly good business to be in, said RBC analyst Deane Dray."}
{"original": "Related: GE's latest sale: Its 111-year-old rail business"}

{"original": "It's become more commoditized. It's not a technology-rich business, said Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna."}
{"original": "A century ago, the light bulb unit produced some of GE's greatest innovations. In 1892, GE began machine-molding bulbs instead of hand-blowing them. A GE engineer developed the first modern light bulb in 1906. And in 1935, GE light bulbs were used to light the first nighttime Major League Baseball game."}
{"original": "GE, coming off its worst year since the 2008 crisis, has promised to sell $20 billion of businesses by the end of next year to raise cash and pay down debt."}
{"original": "Wall Street cheered GE's $11 billion deal on Monday to exit the rail business. The sale was seen as a step in the right direction and potential evidence that the worst is over for GE. The company's stock has soared 10% in May, though it remains down 12% this year."}
{"original": "Related: GE's subprime mortgage unit could file for bankruptcy"}

{"original": "Forbes pulls the plug after five years, bows out of GOP presidential race Millionaire publisher heads back to 'Forbes' magazine By Ian Christopher McCaleb/CNN WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Steve Forbes traded in the keys of his presidential campaign bus on Thursday for a return trip to his editing desk at 'Forbes' magazine, by opting to end his self-financed, five year-tenure as a Republican presidential candidate. At an appearance in Washington, Forbes made the expected announcement that he would abandon his GOP presidential bid. As my father once said when he lost a governor's race in New Jersey: 'We were nosed out by a landslide,' quipped Forbes, who was flanked by his wife Sabina, two of his five daughters, national campaign manager Ken Blackwell, and Georgia Republican Rep. Bob Barr, a staunch supporter. I have no regrets, and you shouldn't either, Forbes told the boisterous group of supporters that attended his departure announcement at a Washington hotel. I am withdrawing from the presidential contest but I am not withdrawing from the public square, Forbes said, adding after being pressed by reporters that he plans, for the time being, to return to 'Forbes' magazine, where he is chief executive officer and editor-in-chief. I will be going back to 'Forbes' magazine, he said. As a matter of fact, tomorrow I have to write some editorials. Deadlines are deadlines. Forbes did say, however, that he has not ruled out running for elective office at a later date. I'm not ruling anything out, he said."}
{"original": "The well-heeled publishing heir, who poured an estimated $66 million of his personal fortune into the 1996 and 2000 presidential races, decided to toss in the towel on his 2000 bid after a disastrous third-place showing in Tuesday's Delaware GOP primary. His departure from the race essentially narrows the Republican field of hopefuls to two -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who won Delaware with 51 percent of the vote, and Arizona Sen. John McCain. Talk show host Alan Keyes still stands as a candidate, but his ability to make a dent in the support accorded to Bush and McCain seems questionable at best. Standing by an earlier guarantee, Forbes refused to endorse any of the three Republicans left in the race for the 2000 nomination, though he threw each measured compliments throughout his news conference. John McCain, Gov. Bush and Alan Keyes are good people, he said. I've gotten to know them. ... But endorsements have become a debased currency in the presidential arena. What I need to do now is wind down my campaign. An endorsement, if I make one, may come in a few weeks. Forbes credited his 2000 campaign, which in effect was launched with the end of his 1996 candidacy, with elevating the dialogue among the full Republican field -- which stood at 10 some months ago, before being whittled down to three by Thursday. Our new conservative agenda will come to pass, mark my words, he said."}
{"original": "Among the issues he raised to prominence, Forbes insisted, were tax reform; abortion; fair, equitable treatment of those serving in the military and proper benefit distribution to veterans; school choice; greater consumer latitude in dealing with health insurance companies; and the ability of every American to manipulate their Social Security retirement funds as they see fit. Who will now pick up the banner of freedom and march to victory this year, I do not know, Forbes said. The beginning of the end Forbes, who had been in Michigan for a series of campaign events, canceled those appearances Wednesday and flew home to New Jersey to huddle with his family and his campaign advisors after his unexpected third-place showing in Delaware. His defeat there, where he enjoys high name recognition -- he won the state's primary in 1996 -- and where he campaigned vigorously in the course of the last week, solidified a decision to withdraw that Forbes had reportedly bandied about since last weekend. After not winning there (this year), I had to ask myself if we could make this thing work, he said Thursday. With reluctance, I had to decide that the opportunity did just not appear to be there. To stay in the race any longer, Forbes continued, would be to do damage to the party, because (the press) would focus on things like, 'when is he going to get out.'"}
{"original": "Forbes burst on the political scene with his radical, 17 percent flat-tax proposal in 1996, and a series of negative ads that wounded the eventual Republican nominee, former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole. But Forbes failed to expand his base or organize in key states, and his candidacy failed. With the end of the 1996 presidential election cycle, Forbes opted to begin his 2000 effort with a few new twists, long before Republican establishment favorite Bush and the dark horse McCain tipped their hands and made their intentions to run known. The publishing heir -- chided from all sides for his background of privilege during the 1996 race -- first moved to retool his campaign operation by building his organization from local offices on up to provide a more grass roots feel. As the 2000 campaign heated up, Forbes chose to look past trends showing that many Republican voters were adopting a moderate lean, and while promoting his flat tax plan, he sharpened his social agenda to include calls against legalized abortion, as well as a series of so-called pro-family, morally based pronouncements. But the conservative voting bloc Forbes hoped to appeal to was split by a crowded field of right-leaning candidates that included Keyes, Gary Bauer and Sen. Orrin Hatch. The latter two men have left the race. The messenger may have gotten tripped up, but if the message is good, he can't regret doing it, he said Thursday."}

{"original": "Business leaders from 131 Seattle-based companies have signed a letter voicing their objections to the tax."}

{"original": "Ms. Trump was required to recuse from participating in the implementation of the opportunity zones program. She clearly did not, CREW wrote in its letter dated Friday to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Thus, Ms. Trump appears to have participated in a particular matter that affects her imputed financial interests, and may have violated the conflict of interest law."}
{"original": "Peter Mirijanian – the spokesperson for Abbe Lowell, Trump's ethics attorney – called CREW's request a politically motivated and meritless complaint."}
{"original": "The Opportunity Zones legislation is a broad-sweeping, bi-partisan policy that impacts nearly 35 million Americans in communities designated by each state's governor as underserved and in need of investment, Mirijanian said in a statement provided to CNN.

{"original": "Washington (CNN) Coronavirus has swept through the federal prison system in the past three weeks, leaving more than 300 confirmed cases among inmates, at least nine prisoners dead, and raising concerns about the government's handling of the crisis."}
{"original": "Inside some facilities, inmates have said they are locked in crammed and cramped cells without face masks and enough soap, and guards have grown concerned that they could be spreading the disease to their families. At a prison in Butner, North Carolina, the number of cases jumped by dozens -- nearly 400% -- earlier this week. And in Oakdale, Louisiana, where six inmates have died in recent days , armed corrections officers had to quell a small uprising with pepper spray on Wednesday, an official at the prison said."}
{"original": "While the reported number of sickened inmates represents less than half a percent of the total federal prison system, the rapid spread of the virus behind the walls of the Bureau of Prison's 122 facilities has mirrored the outside world, and new clusters of the pandemic have emerged at prisons across the country with alarming speed. Inmates, officers and civil liberties advocates say it paints a picture of a system that moved too slowly and continues to leave people behind bars in unhygienic conditions without enough protective equipment."}
{"original": "In his first interview since the pandemic began, Bureau of Prisons Director Michael Carvajal defended the steps his agency has taken amid what he described as the most challenging situation the federal prison system has been confronted with in decades."}
{"original": "I don't think anybody was ready for this Covid, so we're dealing with it just as well as anybody else and I'd be proud to say we're doing pretty good, said Carvajal, who was named director in late February during the pandemic."}
{"original": "The Bureau of Prisons has taken a wide range of steps since the virus was first detected — shutting down visitations, instituting quarantines for all new inmates, and, last week, moving all of the country's 150,000 federal inmates into near-isolation."}
{"original": "Over the past week, prison officials have also begun to release certain vulnerable inmates early, and handing out face coverings to every inmate and correctional officer that remained."}
{"original": "It's easy to critique those hot spots, but we don't control that, said Carvajal. We can only control the people inside of our institutions, and we put things in place to do that."}
{"original": "The Bureau of Prisons began preparing for the potential spread of the virus in January, when early reports of the deadly illness were emerging from China. A task force was established with the system's medical leaders, and prisons were instructed to review pre-existing influenza pandemic plans and begin adjusting them for the budding outbreak. Soon after, said Dr. Jeffrey Allen, the bureau's medical director, they began screening all incoming prisoners and certain staff for symptoms of the illness."}
{"original": "On February 25, Attorney General William Barr, who oversees the federal prison system, moved Carvajal, the 28-year Bureau of Prisons veteran who started off as a prison guard in Texas, into the top job. Two days later, he received his first briefing on the virus."}
{"original": "It was quite overwhelming, a week or two into this job, knowing that we were going to have to deal with something like this, he said."}
{"original": "On March 13, just after the World Health Organization classified the coronavirus a pandemic, and as President Donald Trump declared a national emergency, the Bureau of Prisons took its most aggressive step, banning all social visitors and most lawyers from all facilities across the country. Carvajal said it is the most serious response since 1995 when the entire federal prison went on a complete lockdown after a series of riots. Prison officials were told to cut down on the transfers of inmates between facilities, and an automatic two-week quarantine was soon after implemented for all new inmates entering a facility."}
{"original": "'I don't know if anybody fully appreciated the scope of what needed to be done'"}
{"original": "At the Oakdale, Louisiana, prison, the epicenter of the outbreak in the federal system, the virus may have started to spread as prison workers made routine rounds through different facilities, said Ronald Morris, a longtime maintenance foreman and a local union president."}
{"original": "The agency was very unprepared when it hit, Morris said. They could have locked down the institution or put it on a modified scheduling, had a lot more control of movement and everything to keep it more contained if it did kick off, and it wouldn't have gotten all over our institution."}
{"original": "On March 18, the Bureau of Prisons announced it had its first two presumed cases of coronavirus: a staffer at a medium security federal prison in Berlin, New Hampshire, and an employee at a Bureau of Prisons administrative facility in Grand Prairie, Texas."}
{"original": "By then corrections officers were reporting they did not have enough personal protective equipment to shield themselves as they handled inmates. They were also told to return to work within 48 hours of exposure to an inmate with a suspected or confirmed infection, according to an occupational safety lawsuit filed late last month against the Bureau of Prisons by a corrections officer union."}
{"original": "Morris said they still don't have enough protective equipment and at last count, he said Thursday, there were less than 500 specialized masks left for about the same number of workers."}
{"original": "The bureau's steps continue to draw criticism from those who think they should have moved more quickly to protect inmates and staff."}
{"original": "They claim that they started doing contingency planning in January. It's April and they're now just telling staff to wear gloves and masks and telling staff to provide inmates masks, said Todd Bussert, a criminal defense attorney who's represented a wide variety of federal defendants. Are they doing everything? I don't know if anybody fully appreciated the scope of what needed to be done."}
{"original": "You would think in a correctional setting they'd be acutely sensitive to the heightened risks, Bussert said."}
{"original": "In the interview Friday, Carvajal stood by the agency's decisions to only shut down visitations and slow internal movement in March."}
{"original": "A lot of folks don't understand you don't just shut down a prison system like that, Carvajal said. I understand the criticism of the timing on it, but that's where I believe that experience on running prisons — and we know our population, we know what we can and can't do and the right time to do it, and that played a big role in making the decision."}
{"original": "Carvajal said a full-scale lockdown, where inmates would be entirely confined to their cells, is unhealthy and not necessary at this point. He said he feared such a move could also lead to riots, like what happened in two locally run prisons in Washington and Kansas this week."}
{"original": "I take it very seriously when we're going to put people in their cells and restrict movement. That's not healthy, that's not good either, and I'd like to think that that's the last resort, he said."}
{"original": "He maintained that the Bureau of Prisons has an ample supply of personal protective equipment for staff, and said that face masks had been available to the essential personnel that needed them when the virus was in its early stages. They were handed out widely earlier this week after US public health officials recommended their use by the general public."}
{"original": "In a staff wide message Carvajal recorded Friday, a copy of which was obtained by CNN, he also noted that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention engaged with staff at the Oakdale prison in order to assess their measures to reduce transmission of the virus and care for inmates in isolation. According to Carvajal, the CDC indicated that the BOP was implementing all the strategies that they would have recommended."}
{"original": "A medical support team has also been sent to Oakdale and hundreds of additional Bureau of Prisons officers are expected to be deployed to hard hit facilities to cover staff shortages, Carvajal said."}
{"original": "Carvajal has also faced criticized for continuing to transfer inmates between facilities during the lockdown -- from correctional officers worried about coming into contact with new prisoners and lawmakers concerned about the spread of the virus into their districts -- but he said Friday that it's actually been a tool to help stem of the virus by preventing overcrowding. Still, the number of internal inmate transfers is down by 81% compared with the same time last year, the Bureau of Prisons has said."}
{"original": "Directives from the Justice Department met with mixed results"}
{"original": "As the Bureau of Prisons put in place measures to restrict the movement and routines of prisons, inmates and their friends and family members who spoke with CNN said conditions remained dire. Allegations of unhygienic conditions have also been gathered in lawsuits, including one filed this week by the ACLU, demanding the speedy release of certain vulnerable populations."}
{"original": "In late March, a doctor wearing a Tyvex suit, a face shield and a mask told a group of prisoners at the minimum security prison camp in Otisville, New York, that the majority of them could be infected. They were told to keep their cubicles clean."}
{"original": "Grace Razzouk said her husband Sassine, who is incarcerated at Otisville on bribery and tax evasion charges and has a respiratory disease, has begun coughing so badly that he has to use his emergency inhaler three times in one day, compared to that many times in one month. She learned Thursday night that he had been moved to quarantine by the medical staff."}
{"original": "They have no masks. They have their own soap, she said. The only precautions they are taking is they are taking temperature on a daily basis."}
{"original": "As the number of infected inmates was just starting to rise, Barr issued a directive instructing the Bureau of Prisons to prioritize the release of non-violent prisoners who were vulnerable to the virus and had served a large portion of their sentence."}
{"original": "It's a practice that has been embraced more quickly by state and local prison facilities, where the vast majority of the country's prison population are housed. So far, 886 prisoners have been released to home confinement from the federal system since Barr's directive, mainly from halfway houses."}
{"original": "Razzouk is hoping her husband will be one of the many who will be released early because of his vulnerability to the virus."}
{"original": "At Otisville, where many white collar convicts wait out their sentences, inmates say at least a dozen prisoners have been selected for release."}
{"original": "The results have been mixed. At the Midwest facility, an inmate told CNN the directive had not been communicated to case managers who play a major role in home confinement decisions. Two prisoners were told that the case manager was unaware of Barr's push, with the staff member telling them that none of you are going home, according to the inmate."}
{"original": "More than two weeks after the virus first showed up in the federal prison system, inmates and staff who had been infected are slowly beginning to recover. Carvajal said that he understands the anxiety among his staff. We're battling a threat here that is unseen, he said. That's not normal for anyone."}
{"original": "This story has been updated to include a Friday message from Carvajal to staff, obtained by CNN."}
{"original": "(CNN) This is the moment for the ultimate question of the Bernie Sanders movement: is the United States ready for a socialist President?"}
{"original": "At Wednesday's Democratic presidential debate, Sanders defended himself as a socialist (he calls himself a democratic socialist) and then dismissed a recent poll that suggested Americans do not have a favorable view of socialism."}
{"original": "Who was leading in that poll, he asked the debate moderator? He was, although the moderator didn't know it."}

{"original": "Polling does suggest discomfort with a socialist President"}
{"original": "It is true the Sanders was leading in the poll, conducted by the Wall Street Journal and NBC -- but only among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents when asked who they supported for the Democratic nomination. He had 27% support compared to Mike Bloomberg, Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, each with 14% support. And in a hypothetical matchup, he was narrowly ahead of President Donald Trump."}
{"original": "Come November, it will be all Americans over the age of 18 who elect the Electoral College that picks the President."}
{"original": "Those results and the questions they raise about whether the country would accept a socialist are repeated in an NPR / PBS News Hour Marist poll"}
{"original": "In that poll, Sanders had even more support -- 31% in the Democratic primary compared to Michael Bloomberg, in second place with 19%."}
{"original": "Take a look at the party breakdown regarding socialism. Fifty percent of Democrats have a favorable view of socialism compared to 46% who have a favorable view of capitalism."}
{"original": "But again, socialism is far less favorable than capitalism in the country as a whole. In the NPR poll, among Americans overall, just 28% had a favorable view of socialism compared to 57% who had a favorable view of capitalism."}
{"original": "Among Republicans, 76% held a favorable view of capitalism compared to 7% who felt favorably about socialism."}
{"original": "And, among independents -- who may or may not decide the next presidential election -- it was 23% who had a favorable view of socialism compared to 59% who had a favorable view of capitalism."}
{"original": "And while views of socialism are slightly favorable among Democrats, they're below 35% for whites (25%), minorities (33%), Gen Xers (28%), Baby Boomers (20%), and the Silent Generation (20%)."}
{"original": "Favorable views of socialism are greatest among younger adults (38% favorable), who just happen to also be Sanders' base of support."}
{"original": "Sanders isn't afraid to gloss over a point he doesn't like, as when former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg asked him where he's going to find $25 trillion to pay for his health care plan."}
{"original": "Maybe we can talk -- maybe we can talk about a billionaire saying that we should not raise the minimum wage or that we should cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. If that's a way to beat Donald Trump, wow, I would be very surprised, said Sanders, who wants to erase the private US health care system for something completely government-run and without premiums."}
{"original": "He also hit Bloomberg, who is worth tens of billions of dollars and is pouring hundreds of millions into his campaign, about inequality, an issue that has animated the Democratic race."}
{"original": "What we need to do to deal with this grotesque level of wealth and income inequality is make sure that those people who are working -- you know what, Mr. Bloomberg, it wasn't you who made all that money, maybe your workers played some role in that as well, he said."}
{"original": "Bloomberg said Sanders' points -- he wants to do away with billionaires -- were ridiculous."}
{"original": "I can't think of a way that would make it easier for Donald Trump to get reelected than listening to this conversation. It's ridiculous. We're not going throw out capitalism. We tried that. Other countries tried that. It was called communism. It just didn't work, he said."}
{"original": "That communism barb drew cries of outrage from Sanders and Warren, although she identifies as capitalist."}
{"original": "Communism today is associated with repressive regimes in the Soviet Union and China, although it is was, in the vision of Karl Marx, the next step after socialism"}
{"original": "Sanders said at a CNN town hall last April that he opposes authoritarian communism in the mold of the Soviet Union."}
{"original": "Rather, when he talks about democratic socialism, he means, I believe in a democratic civilized society health care is a human right. Government should make that happen. I believe that every young person in this country regardless of his or her income has the right to get all the education they need."}
{"original": "He usually points to Denmark, which has a regressive and high VAT tax (imagine a 25% federal sales tax on everything, split in stages between manufacturers, retailers and consumers). But it also has generous benefits that raise quality of life for every Dane."}
{"original": "I can't speak for all billionaires, he said Wednesday. All I know is I've been very lucky, made a lot of money and I'm giving it all away to make this country better. And a good chunk of it goes to the Democratic party as well."}
{"original": "He also pointed out that Sanders, after starting his movement in 2016, became a millionaire and has multiple homes."}
{"original": "Sanders argued that the US tax system helps the rich more than the poor and the middle class. He said more of the country's wealth should be spread around. Bloomberg pointed out it's Congress and the Senate that write the tax code. And Sanders is currently a senator."}
{"original": "As with so much, Sanders' seems more focused on changing the way Americans think about things than actually enacting policy, although he and Warren both have plans to ramp up taxes on the wealthy. Warren wants to tax wealth rather than income."}
{"original": "When Donald Trump gets $800 million in tax breaks and subsidies to build luxury condominiums, that's socialism for the rich, Sanders said. We have to subsidize Walmart's workers on Medicaid and food stamps because the wealthiest family in America pays starvation wages. That's socialism for the rich. I believe in democratic socialism for working people. Not billionaires. Health care for all. Educational opportunity for all."}
{"original": "Bloomberg pointed out that even though he's a billionaire, he wants to raise taxes on the wealthy, and he pointed out that as mayor in New York, he did raise taxes."}
{"original": "President Donald Trump has already tried to paint all Democrats as socialists."}
{"original": "There is, however, another important element to all of this. If anyone who isn't Sanders, let alone a billionaire like Bloomberg, were the Democratic nominee, would Sanders' socialist supporters show up to vote in November? And, conversely, if Sanders wins the nomination, will Bloomberg, Tom Steyer and other liberal billionaires stick to their promises to underwrite Democrats' efforts to unseat Trump as well as other Republicans?"}
{"original": "New York (CNN Business) President Donald Trump certainly lived up to his self-proclaimed status as the King of Debt during his term in office. The national debt spiked by $7 trillion during Trump's tenure -- and it's about to soar much higher under his successor."}
{"original": "Armed with a slim majority in the US Senate , President-elect Joe Biden is expected to make the case Thursday for a $2 trillion fiscal package to repair and rebuild the economy. That would be on top of the $900 billion relief package launched last month."}
{"original": "The proposal, made up of $2,000 stimulus checks, state and local aid, and unemployment insurance, aims to shore up a recovery that looks increasingly fragile. The Biden team's package is a shoot for the moon approach , one lawmaker told CNN."}
{"original": "Adding to America's $27 trillion mountain of debt may be painful, but it's the wise move given the scale of the problems and dirt-cheap borrowing costs."}
{"original": "This is not the time to tighten the belt. The economy is in no condition for austerity, said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM."}
{"original": "This is the time to hit the fiscal accelerator to get the animal spirits moving and get the economy back on track, Brusuelas added. It's a no-brainer."}
{"original": "At this point, there are no tax hikes in the works to offset the cost. The goal of pursuing even more deficit-spending, so soon after the last package, would be to limit the scarring caused by the health crisis and address worsening inequality."}
{"original": "Despite the record stock market highs, parts of the economy are reeling. Movie theaters, airlines, hotels and other sectors are hemorrhaging losses. The Back-to-Normal Index , created by CNN Business and Moody's Analytics, shows that the US economy is operating at just 74% of where it was in early March."}
{"original": "We're still in a very deep hole. We could do tremendous long-run damage to the economy if we don't get things done quickly, said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC."}
{"original": "Faucher added that failing to repair the economy now will make it harder to fix the budget later and address structural challenges posed by Medicare and Social Security."}
{"original": "If we don't get stimulus and we limp along, you'll be fighting over a smaller pie, he said."}
{"original": "Others argue the Biden team should wait a few months to assess the impact of last month's $900 billion package, which provided more small business loans and prevented unemployment benefits from expiring."}
{"original": "It seems quite premature to say we need another $2 trillion now given what we just passed, said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan fiscal watchdog group."}
{"original": "Still, she acknowledged we probably need to do more borrowing before it's time to pivot away."}
{"original": "In early January, CRFB projected the US budget deficit would total $2.3 trillion for fiscal 2021, down from $3.1 trillion last fiscal year. But at 10.4%, debt-to-GDP would be higher than any other time in US history outside of World War II."}
{"original": "Given that Democrats now control the US Senate, MacGuineas said the budget deficit is likely to go even higher than previously estimated."}
{"original": "The US balance sheet was in tatters long before the pandemic erupted, as lawmakers have continually avoided making painful reforms to Social Security and Medicare. The deficit exploded during the Trump era amid bipartisan spending surges and GOP tax cuts, which failed to pay for themselves. The United States entered the pandemic with a $1 trillion deficit."}
{"original": "The Trump administration was one of the most fiscally reckless of recent times, said MacGuineas. On every chance to make the fiscal situation better, this administration chose to make it worse."}
{"original": "$2,000 stimulus checks -- but to whom?"}
{"original": "The Biden administration may have a difficult time convincing lawmakers to support $2,000 stimulus checks -- a popular idea advocated by both Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders."}
{"original": "The $2,000 stimulus checks are needed right now."}
{"original": "Nearly 8 million more Americans have joined the ranks of the poor since June, according to researchers from the University of Chicago and University of Notre Dame. And about 27 million adults were in households where there was sometimes or often not enough to eat in the last seven days, according to a Census Household Pulse Survey late last year."}
{"original": "Yet the red-hot stock and housing markets suggest other families are doing better than a year ago."}
{"original": "Brusuelas said the next round of stimulus checks should be limited to unemployed Americans and those who can document income loss. We can't be putting forward money in an undisciplined way, he said."}
{"original": "Biden enters the White House during a time of unthinkably low interest rates. The United States can borrow for 10 years at just 1%, compared with about 3% when President Obama took office."}
{"original": "But if borrowing costs rise significantly, that mountain of debt will become that much heavier."}
{"original": "That's why Peter Orszag, Robert Rubin and Joseph Stiglitz argue in a paper published Thursday that Washington needs to take a totally different approach. Their article, in the Peterson Institute for International Economics, lays out a plan to reduce the budget's exposure to interest rate swings by extending debt maturities, while at the same time automatically adjust spending in response to economic conditions."}
{"original": "While low interest rates change the contours of the fiscal debate, the trio wrote, they should not be assumed to persist forever."}

{"original": "Germany may have dodged a recession but its economic performance in 2018 was still the weakest in five years, adding to evidence that trade tensions and a sharp slowdown in China are hampering global growth."}
{"original": "The German economy grew 1.5% in 2018, according to preliminary government data published Tuesday. That's a sharp drop from the 2.2% expansion in 2017, and the slowest annual rate since the European debt crisis."}
{"original": "The euro slumped nearly 0.4% to $1.14 after the GDP data was released."}
{"original": "Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, said the German economy has been hit by a series of shocks."}
{"original": "Trade tensions, turmoil in emerging markets, a temporary spike in oil prices, uncertainty over Brexit and a sharp economic slowdown in China all contributed to the weakness."}
{"original": "Some of the country's leading companies have suffered."}
{"original": "Carmakers such as Volkswagen (VLKAF) have been hurt by weaker sales in China, and they've struggled to certify some new models under new EU emissions tests. Volkswagen delivered a record 10.8 million cars around the world in 2018, but slumping sales in China at the end of the year limited annual growth in the key market to just 0.5%."}
{"original": "German growth was weakest in the second half of 2018, and especially the third quarter, when the economy contracted 0.2%."}
{"original": "Official data for the final three months of the year is not yet available, but German statistics officials said Tuesday that the economy likely returned to growth during the fourth quarter to dodge a recession."}
{"original": "Yet Schmieding said the malaise is likely to continue in 2019."}
{"original": "Berenberg expects the German economy to grow just 1.2% in 2019, matching the rest of the eurozone. Economists at Capital Economics forecast even weaker growth of just 1%."}
{"original": "For the next few months, we have to brace ourselves for a very grey winter, said Schmieding."}
{"original": "Trouble in Europe's largest economy will deepen worries about slower global growth this year. Risks clouding the global outlook include the trade war and the impact of US interest rate hikes on emerging markets."}
{"original": "Analysts are also worried about China's economy, a major engine of growth in recent years that is now showing signs of a sharp slowdown."}
{"original": "Beijing on Tuesday announced 1.3 trillion yuan ($193 billion) worth of new measures designed to stimulate the economy, including tax cuts for small businesses and reduced tariffs."}
{"original": "It's the latest in a flurry of government efforts to prop up growth in recent months, such as boosting infrastructure spending and looser monetary policy."}
{"original": "The idea of striking out on your own after being a salaried working stiff for years can be enticing."}
{"original": "And it's all the more so now that the tax overhaul created a 20% deduction for those running their own business."}
{"original": "But there's a lot to consider when figuring out whether you really would do better financially by being self-employed."}
{"original": "Ask yourself these questions before quitting your day job."}
{"original": "Would you qualify for the new deduction?"}
{"original": "That question isn't as simple as it sounds. There's a complicated formula to determine who qualifies and who doesn't, and even tax experts aren't sure how to interpret the law."}
{"original": "Here are the basic rules: If your taxable income will fall below $157,500 as a single freelancer or $315,000 as a married one, you'll be eligible for the deduction."}
{"original": "Keep in mind taxable income is more than just your business income. It includes all income sources, such as your investment income and your spouse's earnings."}
{"original": "Related: Who can take the new business tax deduction? Even tax experts aren't sure"}
{"original": "If you make more than that, you may still be eligible, but only if you meet certain criteria."}
{"original": "For example, service businesses in several fields -— such as health, law, accounting, finance and the performing arts — may not take the deduction."}
{"original": "Neither can businesses that rely on their founders' reputation or skill as a principal asset. But no one knows yet what lawmakers were targeting with this exclusion. And the IRS won't be issuing guidance for many months."}
{"original": "Another eligibility test is based on the wages your business pays to you and others. There are complicated wage formulas you'll have to apply to figure out a) if you can take the deduction and b) if so, how much of you income is really deductible."}
{"original": "What will your real tax burden be?"}
{"original": "If you do qualify for the new 20% deduction, you may pay less in income taxes than you do now. But you'll still pay more in payroll taxes than you would as an employee."}
{"original": "That's because employers normally pay half of the 15.3% Social Security and Medicare tax owed on your gross income."}
{"original": "Independent workers must pay the full 15.3%. You may deduct half of that on your tax return. But you'll still end up paying more in payroll taxes."}
{"original": "Every case will differ in terms of how you'd fare overall. But just as one example: A single freelancer making $70,000 could pay $1,100 more in total federal tax (income + payroll) this year than someone making $70,000 as an employee, according to The Tax Institute at H&R Block."}
{"original": "Still, the 20% deduction can go a long way to closing the gap between the overall tax burden of an employee vs. a freelancer."}
{"original": "It will help people become more entrepreneurial, said Jonathan Medows, a CPA who specializes in working with the self-employed."}
{"original": "How valuable are your tax-free benefits at work?"}
{"original": "Compare how much your current job is really worth with how much you'd need to make as a freelancer just to break even."}
{"original": "As an employee, valuable tax-free benefits are part of your total compensation — e.g., subsidies to buy health and other types of insurance, a 401(k) match, sick days and vacation days, among others."}
{"original": "The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates 32% of your total compensation is due to these non-wage benefits. So if you're grossing $68,000, your employer is really spending about $100,000 on you."}
{"original": "To be on equal footing, a freelancer may need to earn 20% to 30% more than an employee, said Nathan Rigney, lead tax research analyst at The Tax Institute."}
{"original": "How much is being your own boss worth to you?"}
{"original": "For most traditional freelancers and sole proprietors, you'll probably make less than you did as an employee when you start out, especially once you count your new overhead expenses and other business-related costs."}
{"original": "You'll go backward. And you'll need savings to get you through, Medows said."}
{"original": "Of course, you may assume you can make the same or more thanks to the new deduction if your current employer simply converts you to an independent contractor."}
{"original": "But there are tests governing whether your employer is allowed to reclassify you as contract worker."}
{"original": "It's a good idea to talk to an attorney with expertise in employment law who can advise you on whether you can legally qualify as an independent contractor, Rigney said."}
{"original": "Illinois has just barely avoided the dishonor of becoming America's first junk state."}
{"original": "Moody's decided on Thursday that it won't downgrade Illinois because the cash-strapped state finally passed its first budget in more than two years. S&P Global Ratings similarly removed the threat of an imminent downgrade last week."}
{"original": "Moody's concluded that the Illinois budget deal -- which includes a 32% tax hike -- is enough to ease the enormous financial pressures facing the state. Illinois had built up $15 billion in unpaid bills, affecting everything from mental health services for teens to funding for state colleges and universities."}
{"original": "Even though Illinois has dodged another downgrade bullet, the state remains in financial disarray. After decades of mismanagement, Illinois has built up a stunning pension shortfall of $251 billion that will continue to grow, according to Moody's."}
{"original": "That's why Moody's is keeping a negative outlook on the state, signaling further action could come in the next 12 to 24 months if Illinois gets back into trouble."}
{"original": "Related: Illinois budget crisis puts troubled teens at risk"}
{"original": "In addition to the severe pension shortfall, Moody's said Illinois continues to grapple with a weak governance system and residual political paralysis."}
{"original": "It wasn't clear if the budget compromise was going to be enough for Illinois to avoid a downgrade. Moody's had warned right before the budget was enacted on July 6 that potential shortcomings in the deal could trigger a downgrade from its organization."}
{"original": "Moody's reiterated on Thursday that there is a risk that Illinois will fail to cut spending and raise tax revenue by as much as the budget calls for."}
{"original": "Moody's said the state's failure to enact a budget for two straight years is partially the result of the state's pension time bomb, which was caused by politicians delaying tough decisions."}
{"original": "As the liabilities have grown more difficult, so have the potential political repercussions of addressing them, Moody's said."}
{"original": "The budget deal that President Trump signed into law Friday morning has plenty of critics. But it would do one unarguably good thing: avert a debt ceiling crisis for the next year."}
{"original": "And yet the bipartisan deal accomplishes that in a back-door way -- by suspending the legal cap on U.S. borrowing for a year."}
{"original": "The debt limit is currently set at $20.456 trillion. Rather than raise that limit by a specific dollar amount -- which would require publicly acknowledging the country's costs going forward -- lawmakers chose to suspend the limit through March 1, 2019."}
{"original": "A suspension lets the U.S. Treasury borrow as needed to satisfy the country's legal obligations in full and on time. Those obligations include everything from veteran benefits and military paychecks to contractor fees and bills incurred by all federal programs."}
{"original": "Once the suspension ends, the amount borrowed during the suspension period will be added to the legal debt limit."}
{"original": "Politically, it's easier to pass a suspension, said Shai Akabas, director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center."}
{"original": "Related: Trillion-dollar deficits will hit sooner than expected"}
{"original": "In this case, more than a trillion dollars easier."}
{"original": "The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that by March 2019, the new debt limit could be reset as high as $22 trillion, or $1.5 trillion higher than where it is today."}
{"original": "That reflects both the borrowing needs to pay the country's bills during the suspension period plus the costs of the special accounting measures that Treasury has been using since December 8, when the last suspension ended."}
{"original": "Since 2013, Congress has passed 5 debt limit suspensions."}
{"original": "Related: Trump signs massive budget deal after Congress votes to reopen government"}
{"original": "Given that the country regularly runs deficits, the Treasury must borrow to make up the difference between the revenue it takes in and the money it must pay out."}
{"original": "None of this should surprise anyone on Capitol Hill. After all, every time lawmakers have chosen to increase spending or cut taxes, they effectively require the country to borrow more in future years. And that makes it necessary to raise the debt limit periodically."}
{"original": "That's why fiscal experts stress that increasing the debt ceiling is not giving anyone license to spend more, despite what some politicians claim. It simply authorizes the Treasury to borrow what's needed to pay the country's commitments created by previous legislation."}
{"original": "That the decision is made separately from the actual budget decisions is a bigger problem, Akabas said."}
{"original": "Amazon has narrowed down its hunt for a second home to 20 locations. And the chosen city is likely to get an economic jolt -- particularly to its housing market."}
{"original": "The company announced in September that it plans to open a second corporate headquarters, and a nationwide bidding war soon broke out. Some cities offered massive tax breaks, while others got creative with their courtship. Tucson, Arizona, sent a giant cactus to CEO Jeff Bezos and one Georgia town pledged to name an area The city of Amazon (AMZN)."}
{"original": "The second headquarters is expected to cost at least $5 billion and create as many as 50,000 high-paying jobs -- no wonder cities rushed to lay out the welcome mat."}
{"original": "The selected city will get an immediate boost to jobs and wages, said Javier Vivas, director of economic research for Realtor.com. It will also push up home prices and lead to new home construction in neighborhoods within commuting distance from the headquarters location, he added."}
{"original": "When a big company moves into a new town it tends to have a ripple effect on the local economy: job creation strengthens, some wages increase and home prices rise."}
{"original": "Just look at what happened in Reno, Nevada, after Tesla opened a massive battery factory: Home prices have soared 43% since the fall of 2014, following the start of construction on the Gigafactory, according to Daren Blomquist, senior vice president of communications at ATTOM Data Solutions."}
{"original": "The same phenomenon occurred when Apple moved its headquarters to a new location in its home city of Cupertino, California. In the three years following the project's approval, homes located within a mile of the new campus appreciated three percentage points faster, on average, than the rest of the county, according to Realtor.com."}
{"original": "Related: 3 ways tax reform will hit home values"}
{"original": "Just how much home prices will rise in Amazon's chosen city will depend on a variety of factors: the existing inventory, recent home price performance, demand and the space available for new construction."}
{"original": "Of the 20 cities, those that have seen more modest home price growth than others on the list stand to gain the most, according to Blomquist. He pointed to Pittsburgh, Indianapolis and Columbus, Ohio, as the markets that could see the biggest gains."}
{"original": "The impact in markets where there has been single-digit appreciation ... we could see a jump, at least in the short term, to double digits of 10%-20% or even more appreciation for the first year, he said."}
{"original": "In places where housing is already in limited supply and building regulations are prohibitive -- like New York and Boston -- home values could rise even more with a surge of new residents to staff the new headquarters."}
{"original": "For instance, home prices in Boston have jumped 8.4% in the last year to a median home value of $568,300, according to Zillow. If Boston becomes the new home of Amazon, it would be chaos, according to Fernando Ferreira, an associate professor at Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania."}
{"original": "The housing market would be three times worse than it already is, he said."}
{"original": "Markets with existing inventory and space and fewer obstacles to building will be able to more easily handle the need for new home construction, experts said."}
{"original": "The big winners in the chosen city will be current homeowners who will likely see their home appreciation rise when Amazon moves in."}
{"original": "If you are in a larger house and ready to downsize or move, this will be a pure gain for you, said Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh, professor of finance and director of the Center for Real Estate Finance Research at New York University Stern School of Business."}
{"original": "Another indirect advantage for the winning city: Rising home values will likely to lead to higher property taxes, which could help boost a city's budget and services."}
{"original": "As property taxes and revenues go up, that can go to schools and improve their quality and better fund programs ... and infrastructure, said Van Nieuwerburgh."}
{"original": "Related: In booming economies, food banks are busier than ever"}
{"original": "On the downside, a big jump in home prices means renters or wanna-be homeowners in the selected city could lose out, potentially forcing some long-time residents out of the city."}
{"original": "If you are a first-time homebuyer in the selected city, this is bad news, said Van Nieuwerburgh. Property prices will go up and you will have to borrow more."}

{"original": "The US Chamber of Commerce had a message for Congress on Tuesday: End the shutdown."}
{"original": "The shutdown is harming the American people, the business community, and the economy, Chamber executive vice president Neil Bradley wrote in a letter to Congress. The adverse consequences of the shutdown are wide and growing."}
{"original": "The closure of key government agencies comes as American business owners are struggling to deal with the fallout of President Donald Trump's trade wars, as well as increased market volatility and growing economic uncertainty."}
{"original": "Trump has said the shutdown could last for months – or years – and while it most immediately affects government workers and federal contractors who aren't getting paid, it has created severe challenges for businesses that depend on government data, licensing or other functions."}
{"original": "Farmers, for example, would normally be looking to a monthly report on the supply and demand of agricultural products around the world to help determine what to plant next season. But the next report won't come out as scheduled on January 11 if the US Department of Agriculture remains unfunded."}
{"original": "Businesses that rely on monthly export and import data missed an update Tuesday because the Commerce Department isn't fully operating either. And US businesses that import steel and aluminum and are seeking an exclusion from Trump's tariffs may have to wait longer to hear if their application has been approved, because those applications are also handled by the Commerce Department."}
{"original": "The shutdown also poses challenges for industries that need approval from the federal agencies temporarily shuttered. Pending company mergers, for example, are being slowed because the Securities and Exchange Commission isn't fully staffed."}
{"original": "Breweries trying out new craft beers are stuck, too, because the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which must sign off on all new labels and packaging, has been shut down."}
{"original": "The list of nuisances goes on. The Internal Revenue Service isn't staffed to take questions from employers that must send out W-2s to workers by the end of January, or businesses who have questions about changes under the new tax law."}
{"original": "Employers will also have to wait until the shutdown is over to use the online E-Verify system to confirm whether applicants have a legal right to work in the United States. It doesn't prevent someone from starting to work, but prolongs the on-boarding process – and opens up the risk that companies may have to let go of employees who don't later pass the check, even if they've already started working."}
{"original": "Trump's efforts to overhaul the global trading system has already strained some business owners and farmers. He's said that he wants foreign countries to change their practices and treat Americans fairly, but despite what the President has often suggested, it's not China that's paying for the tariffs but US importers. The duties have raised the price of goods ranging from foreign steel and aluminum to Chinese-made semiconductors and luggage for American companies."}
{"original": "Some businesses, like Missouri-based Cap America, have had to start paying a 10% tariff on a majority of their inventory because it comes from China. The company made most of their baseball caps in-house (and was appropriately named) until 2001, but it became cheaper to buy them from China. Now, about 89% of the caps sold in the United States comes from China. Cap America then embroiders them here."}
{"original": "In December, the company had to set prices for 2019 without knowing if there would be a 10% or 25% tariff on their imports. Trump had threatened to raise the tariff rate to 25% on January 1, but put off the hike while he and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day truce that ends in March."}
{"original": "Phil Page, chairman and CEO of Cap America, said he doesn't expect to know how his price increase will affect demand until the end of the first quarter."}
{"original": "It's the uncertainty that causes the most stress in this situation, he said."}
{"original": "Retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries have closed off some markets to American farmers. China stopped buying American soybeans for about six months, though purchases restarted in December. Mexico put tariffs on American pork and Canada imposed duties on beef."}
{"original": "A new trade deal struck between the United States, Mexico and Canada to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement has offered some reassurance to farmers that markets to the North and South would remain open to trade."}
{"original": "But even though Trump and his counterparts signed the deal in December, it must still be approved by Congress where leaders from the Democratically controlled House have voiced concerns about its labor and environmental provisions."}
{"original": "Lawmakers are expected to wait for an economic impact study before taking a vote, but it's unlike that will come before mid-March. It's being done by the US International Trade Commission, which has suspended investigative activities during the shutdown. Plus, Trump has threatened to withdraw from the original deal in the meantime, which could invite more tariffs on US goods and risk an economic shock."}
{"original": "Despite the new trade deal, the retaliatory tariffs will remain in place while Trump keeps duties on foreign steel and aluminum. Many businesses and farmers have urged the administration to lift those taxes."}
{"original": "In the interim, the US Department of Agriculture has offered some financial aid to farmers hurt by the tariffs – but it's not processing new applications during the shutdown. The agency said Tuesday that it would extend the application deadline by the number of days the government remains shut down, but won't pay out money until Congress votes to reopen."}

There were 115.8 million single Americans in 2016, which is about 47.3% of the adult population. Forty-nine percent were women, and 45.5% were men."}

If you both work, and make about the same amount, it can seem like you're getting a 100% raise. One often-cited 2005 study from Ohio State University found married people experience a per person net worth increase of 77% over singles. Additionally, their combined wealth increases on average by 16% for each year of marriage. Another plus, if one partner loses his or her job, the other's income provides a safety net."}
{"original": "Married couples don't automatically benefit when it's tax time. Depending on income, some are eligible for bonuses and certain deductions where singles aren't, but in certain situations, they are responsible for paying a tax penalty that could eat up a large portion of their combined salaries.

{"original": "They have a lower risk for heart problems as well, says a 2014 study from the American College of Cardiology. Researchers there screened 3.5 million adults for cardiovascular problems and found that those who were married had less heart disease and healthier blood vessels throughout the body than people who were single, divorced or widowed."}
{"original": "Couples and families sharing a plan are sometimes able to pay toward the same annual deductible, which would make benefits coverage kick in faster, saving money."}
{"original": "The takeaway from these advantages relies on whether the couples had happy marriages. Stress and depression resulting from unhappy partnerships can adversely affect health, an issue singles don't have to face. Researchers from the University of Utah found in 2009 that middle-aged women in unhappy marriages showed risk factors for heart attacks and diabetes."}

{"original": "It seems like many people aren't getting enough sleep anyway, no matter what their relationship status is. Data from the CDC shows that almost one-third of American adults aren't getting the recommended seven hours of sleep each night, and single mothers are getting even less. The study found that 43.5% got less than seven hours. Adults either without kids or without kids at home got a few more winks closer to the right amount, where 29.7% had fewer than seven hours."}
{"original": "Perhaps a snoring partner is the culprit for some of this lack of sleep. A 2015 survey from the American Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine found 40% of women claim snoring in the opposite sex is a turn-off, and nearly one in 10 Americans went so far as to admit that snoring has hurt at least one of their romantic relationships."}

{"original": "What's the best financial investment for the next five years?—Dave"}
{"original": "Finding a safe harbor for your money in the short- to mid-term creates a challenging check list."}
{"original": "You want your money to take on more risk and earn you more than if it were just hanging out in your savings account, earning hardly anything. But you also want it to be relatively accessible on a five-year timeline. And that's to say nothing of the pitfalls of the current economic environment, in which we're staring down higher interest rates, changing tax situations and trade tensions."}
{"original": "The good news is you can cross a few things off your list right away. Like real estate."}
{"original": "When you're looking for liquidity and safety on a horizon of only five years, you don't want to be invested in a piece of real estate that you have to work desperately to get out of in a down market, says Derek Green, a broker and investment adviser with Titus Wealth Management in Folsom, California."}
{"original": "Sure, there's potential for growth by investing in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum, but the up and down swings in those markets make them too risky for a five year span, according to Green."}
{"original": "Cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile, says Green If it has had a period of downside volatility and you have to sell after five years, it isn't going to be a desirable situation."}
{"original": "So what will keep your money growing with manageable risk in the next half decade?"}
{"original": "Given the economic climate, the stock market remains among the best havens for your money. But some stocks may be safer than others, says Green."}
{"original": "The small- and mid-caps will likely have more of a tailwind given rising rates, a changing tax situation and trade tensions, says Green. Rather than the larger, internationally-oriented companies in the S&P 500."}
{"original": "A small-cap, or a stock with a small capitalization as determined by the total market value of its shares, is stock of companies that generally have a market capitalization between $300 million to $2 billion. Mid-cap stocks are those between $2 billion and $10 billion. (Large cap stocks are those over $10 billion)."}
{"original": "For those looking for something a little safer, Green recommends shorter maturity bonds or a short-term bond exchange traded fund. A shorter duration means less credit risk and less interest rate risk. And those are both good things in a rising interest rate market."}
{"original": "Looking beyond investments, Green advises finding somewhere other than your savings account for the money."}
{"original": "You're probably going to lag behind the rate of inflation in a savings account, he says."}
{"original": "Of course, there are high yield savings accounts available. While they tend to be among the safest options with the lowest risk, they offer the lowest returns. Use these only if security and accessibility to the funds is paramount."}
{"original": "Better than savings accounts are CDs, or certificates of deposit, which are insured, timed deposits offered by banks and credit unions that have very low risk, but offer slightly better returns than savings accounts."}
{"original": "CDs are getting more attractive as short-term interest rates increase."}
{"original": "For example, a CD with a five-year term, might carry an annual percentage yield of 2.65%."}

{"original": "The good news is that means there's a chance for an even bigger prize in the next drawing Saturday night. The size of the jackpot jumped to an estimated $550 million from the $460 million prize heading into Wednesday's drawing."}
{"original": "The winning numbers that no one managed to claim were 2, 18, 37, 39, and 42, with a Powerball number of 12."}
{"original": "But just because no one claimed the jackpot doesn't mean there were no winners. In fact at least six tickets won secondary prizes of $1 million or more. Be sure to check your tickets -- every year billions of dollars in prize money goes unclaimed."}
{"original": "And there's another chance to win big coming up."}

{"original": "This week was the first time on record that both lottery games offered prizes of $400 million or more at the same time. But it's a situation that is set to happen more frequently."}
{"original": "That's because there are now longer odds in both games, leading to less frequent jackpot winners and thus more frequent large jackpots."}
{"original": "In October, Mega Millions changed the numbers that players could choose from, bringing the odds of picking all six numbers to 1 in 302.6 million, from 1 in 258.9 million under the old format. It also raised the price of a single ticket to $2."}
{"original": "Related: Why billions of dollars go unclaimed in lottery"}
{"original": "The idea was to increase the size of the top prize. And so far, it has worked."}
{"original": "The move was similar to one made by Powerball in October 2015. That took the odds of winning that game from 1 in 175 million to 1 in 292 million. The odds of winning both games is 1 in 88 quadrillion."}
{"original": "But the longer odds haven't been stopping people from buying tickets. In fact, the larger jackpots are just encouraging more sales. And Americans do love buying lottery tickets. They spent more than $80 billion on them in 2016. That's more than they spent on movies, video games, music, sports tickets and books -- combined."}

{"original": "It is a sign of progress that Martin Luther King is now a broadly acknowledged American hero, the only non-president honored with a national holiday, celebrated by left, right and center. But we do history a disservice by whitewashing MLK's legacy."}
{"original": "The truth is that, like every martyr, King was hated by many in his time. Some of his most intense critics were southern populists, like Alabama Governor George Wallace and Mississippi Senator James Eastland. And yes, many of these folks were Democrats. But the party label matters much less than the underlying ideology."}
{"original": "Which is why every year around this time, I get a kick out of conservatives claiming MLK as one of their own. The latest was Vice President Mike Pence, who invoked King to defend President Trump's wall proposal, stating:"}
{"original": "One of my favorite quotes from Doctor King was, 'Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.' You think of how he changed America. He inspired us to change through the legislative process to become a more perfect union. That's exactly what President Donald Trump is calling on the Congress to do."}
{"original": "It's hard to imagine two Americans with less in common than Donald Trump and Martin Luther King. Building a wall and demonizing illegal immigrants as being criminals and disease-ridden drug mules is a long, long way from I Have a Dream."}
{"original": "Apparently, the contrast was clear to MLK's son as well, who spoke out on his father's national holiday, saying: Now, Martin Luther King Jr. was a bridge builder, not a wall builder. Martin Luther King Jr. would say love not hate would make America great. Did you all hear that? Love not hate would make America great."}
{"original": "Before those words were heard, President Trump tried to blunt criticism for initially leaving any effort to pay tribute to King out of his schedule, by making an apparently impromptu visit to the MLK memorial on the National Mall with Pence. That's great – but it doesn't compensate for his policies to date."}
{"original": "The diversity-challenged Trump administration has pursued policies that are the opposite of what King supported – from their explicit efforts to roll back voting rights, tax cuts that exacerbate income inequality, proposed cuts to social programs like food stamps, a possible rollback of nondiscrimination regulations for housing, crackdowns on nonwhite immigration and asylum seekers, pursuing policies that rein-in public sector unions while earning the praise of white nationalist groups. And that's just a partial list. It's a reminder that despite all the change we've seen over the past half-century, the underlying fights are not over."}
{"original": "Trump might keep a bust of MLK in the oval office, but his policies and political base represent the opposite of the King tradition. And that's evidenced by his strength in the states of the former Confederacy and his anemic 9% support among African-Americans, according to an August 2018 Quinnipiac poll."}
{"original": "But Pence is far from alone when it comes to conservatives trying to associate themselves with MLK. That list includes such names as conservative populist provocateur Glenn Beck, who invoked Martin Luther King in his Tea Party march on Washington after rallying his troops by calling then-President Obama a racist with a deep-seated hatred of white people. (Beck, in a post-Fox incarnation, said he regretted his comments about Obama.)"}
{"original": "It's all part of a twisting of American history that's become plentiful the further we get from the original civil rights era. King won the argument over America's soul, and his commitment to nonviolence seems safe in the rearview mirror. So we gloss over the fact that he was a target of active measures by the FBI and CIA (former FBI director James Comey kept a copy of the letter authorizing surveillance of King in his office to remind him that with great power comes great responsibility)."}
{"original": "We've also seen proto-Trumpers like Ted Nugent compare himself, as a frequently extreme gun-rights advocate, to Rosa Parks – a twitch that has clearly been festering for a while."}
{"original": "On the flip-side, sometimes we see bigotry defended with big words, pseudo-science and high-minded phrases. That's when it's worth remembering that opponents of civil rights often wrapped their defenses of hate in constitutional arguments, just as slave owners cited the bible a century before."}
{"original": "American heroes belong to all of us. But we do a disservice to our shared history when we whitewash the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King. We diminish the real life and death struggles he faced, the vicious attacks from people in the corridors of power as well as the shouting mob in the streets."}
{"original": "King is accessible today because he was a reformer seeking nonviolent change in an America beset by reactionaries and radicals. He was bitterly attacked as a communist and worse among the white establishment who wanted to fight any change to the Jim Crow status quo – as well as some radical activists who felt he was not extreme enough. King's commitment was to preach an inclusive vision of change that challenged our nation to live up to its ideals. He was effective precisely because he inspired the better angels of our nature while calling out injustice without apology."}

{"original": "A half-century after his death, as we honor King's legacy, we should have a healthy skepticism of people who invoke his name while echoing some of the same arguments as his opponents.

{"original": "Teachers plan on rallying at the state Capitol in Denver on Monday."}
{"original": "After seeing teachers in other states agitate for more funding, Colorado educators are taking their turn."}
{"original": "Hundreds of educators gathered outside lawmakers' offices in Denver, many of them dressed in red T-shirts from the #RedForEd campaign that started in Arizona. They waved signs touting Colorado's nationwide rank in average teacher salary – 46 – and chanted this is what Democracy looks like."}
{"original": "High participation led the Englewood School District to close after more than 150 educators – 70% of its workforce – called in to take a personal day for the rally. Colorado Education Association President Kerrie Dallman said the group hopes more districts will close for its next day of action, April 27."}
{"original": "One teacher from Englewood, Jessica Tarkanian, brought her 7-year-old daughter to Monday's rally. She said she protested to support our retirement, fund our schools, and make sure we get what we need for our kids."}
{"original": "A teacher at Cherrelyn Elementary School, Tarkanian said she recently moved in with another family to save money and make ends meet. She says she's been teaching for 10 years, but earns the same as a teacher with three years of experience."}
{"original": "I'm not sure I can do it anymore, she said."}
{"original": "Inside the state Capitol, members of the Colorado Education Association met with lawmakers to register their concerns. The group says insufficient funding and teacher pay is making the job less attractive to college graduates. Consequently, teachers are leaving the profession early, leading to a shortage of fully qualified teachers."}
{"original": "The group ended the day happy with its progress and eager to keep up the momentum, Dallman said."}
{"original": "The state house finance committee introduced a number of amendments to a pension bill, including one to lower the retirement age. Right now, it's 58, but the bill sought to raise it to 65. The proposed amendment is a compromise at 60, Dallman said, one that teachers are amenable to. The bill is still in committee, but Dallman said it was a sign that lawmakers are willing to listen."}
{"original": "Over 400 educators came to the Capitol today to call for increased funding for public education and a secure retirement – and we are thrilled that legislators listened, Dallman said."}
{"original": "Englewood School District teacher Becky Moraja said she sees high turnover in her district. It's hard to retain teachers as soon as they become aware of the heavy workload and stagnant salaries, she said. We want to keep those extraordinary teachers in Englewood and keep the opportunities for our students."}
{"original": "She and her husband, also a teacher, know the struggle firsthand, she said. They recently moved with their two sons into her mother's home to make ends meet, she said. It was a financial move."}
{"original": "Colorado's educators have been energized by teacher walkouts and demonstrations in West Virginia, Oklahoma, Kentucky and Arizona, Dallman told CNN. Teachers in West Virginia won a 5% pay raise in March after a nine-day strike."}
{"original": "At least one Denver-area school district is closing Monday because so many of its teachers called in to take a personal day for the rally."}
{"original": "The CEA says Colorado educators' average pay has dropped by more than 17% when adjusting for inflation over the last 15 years. In 2016, Colorado ranked 46th in the country for average teachers' salary, according to a report by the National Education Association."}
{"original": "– Education funding: Colorado effectively has underfunded its schools by $828 million, the CEA says, because the state hasn't kept up with a state constitutional mandate passed last decade to increase funds each year by at least the rate of inflation."}
{"original": "Raising taxes to make up that money isn't easy, because the state's 1992 taxpayer bill of rights demands that voters approve any tax hikes."}
{"original": "Third grade teacher Libby Bucher said she referees and coaches sports on the side to make ends meet. She said she has so much debt she had to stop putting money in her retirement account and cancel her life insurance."}

{"original": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren is proposing a new tax on Americans with assets of $50 million or more as part of a bold new initiative to reverse the increasing concentration of wealth among the country's richest households."}
{"original": "According to documents provided by Warren's presidential campaign, the plan would impose a 2% tax on Americans whose net worth exceeds $50 million, with an additional 1% levy on billionaires. It does not specifically address marginal tax rates."}
{"original": "The proposal is among the first and most detailed steps taken by a top-tier Democratic primary hopeful to address what has become, in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and Occupy Wall Street movement, a key issue for the party as a leftward shift that began during the 2016 primary accelerates under President Donald Trump."}
{"original": "Taxing wealth, however, could be very difficult to do. First, there are questions about whether it is permitted by the US Constitution, with legal scholars falling on both sides of the argument. The Constitution gives Congress the power to levy taxes – such as tariffs on commerce. However, it places limitations on so-called direct taxes, though the definition of these has long been unclear."}
{"original": "A 19th century Supreme Court ruling struck down a federal income tax that existed at that time. But the 16th Amendment, which was ratified in 1913, established Congress' right to impose a federal income tax. Also, an early 20th century Supreme Court ruling upheld the ability of Congress to levy an estate tax."}
{"original": "Warren aides told CNN they are confident it would survive any legal challenges posed by questions over its constitutionality. They also believe that, while the bill would be a non-starter in a Republican-controlled Senate, it could be passed via the reconciliation process by Democrats if the party took control of the chamber in 2021 or later. That process requires only a simple majority of voters rather than the 60 most laws need to break a potential filibuster. The aides added that the campaign has not discussed the plan with any other declared or potential presidential hopefuls."}
{"original": "In a pair of letters provided to CNN by Warren's campaign, 17 signers, including multiple former heads of the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice, wrote in defense of the plan's legality."}
{"original": "Constitutional text and history demonstrate that 'direct' tax is best interpreted as a narrow category that would not include a net worth tax (like the one Warren is proposing), one of the letters states, arguing the plan falls squarely within Congress' broad taxing power."}
{"original": "Gene Sperling, a former National Economic Council director under Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, tweeted his support for the plan on Thursday afternoon."}
{"original": "Wealth inequality in our nation is a national scandal. This type of wealth tax that (Sen. Warren) is proposing is essential, Sperling said. It frees up dramatic amounts of resources that make it more likely the vast number Americans can have economic security & a shot at their own small nest egg."}
{"original": "University of California Berkeley economics professors Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, who are well known for their work on income inequality and taxing the rich, worked with the Warren team to analyze the proposal, a source confirmed to CNN. The Washington Post first reported on the plan."}
{"original": "Saez and Zucman estimate that 75,000 households – less than the wealthiest 0.1% – would be subject to this wealth tax. That group has a net worth of roughly $9.3 trillion, they estimate. Billionaires are worth an estimated $2.5 trillion. The plan would raise around $2.75 trillion over 10 years and the billionaire surtax alone would bring in $25 billion in 2019 from roughly 900 families. Both taxes would raise $212 billion this year."}
{"original": "The professors determined that the plan would raise around 1% of the gross domestic product per year."}
{"original": "One of the key motivations for introducing a progressive wealth tax is to curb the growing concentration of wealth, they said in a letter addressed to Warren and provided to CNN."}
{"original": "The top 0.1% of families control about 20% of the nation's wealth in recent years, up from 7% in the late 1970s, they said. Meanwhile, the share of wealth held by the bottom 90% has fallen to 25% from about 35% in the late 1970s. This is mainly because the bottom 90% has racked up debt, including mortgages, consumer credit and student loans."}
{"original": "Currently, the wealthiest 0.1% of families are projected to pay an average of $3.68 million – or 3.2% of their net worth – in federal, state and local taxes in 2019. The proposed wealth tax would add an extra $1.27 million, bringing the total tax burden to 4.3%, the professors estimate."}
{"original": "The bottom 99% of families have a total tax burden of 7.2% of their wealth. This is because they are mainly taxed on income from their labor, while the rich make money from their wealth and that's taxed at a lower rate."}

{"original": "Ranjeet Ranjan, a member of parliament from the eastern state of Bihar, plans to introduce a bill designed to curb excessive wedding expenses in India."}
{"original": "The proposal, should it become law, would require families that shell out more than 500,000 rupees ($7500) on nuptials to donate 10% of the money spent to a special government fund. The money raised would be used to help poorer families pay for their own weddings."}
{"original": "The bill would also authorize the government to fix the limit of guests and relatives and number of dishes to be served in order to prevent food wastage."}

{"original": "(CNN) The lived effects of racism and inequality constitute America's biggest public health and safety crisis , and it demands bold, courageous action in 2021. The Biden-Harris administration's first 100 days should be devoted to developing, unveiling and implementing a National Racial Truth, Justice and Healing Commission, with executive authority charged with three broad missions. The commission could be run out of the Oval Office, perhaps overseen by senior domestic adviser Susan Rice, and have a staff that included a congressional liaison to help pursue legislative programs while simultaneously using executive authority wherever possible to achieve its objective."}
{"original": "First, the new administration should organize a diverse group of scholars who will be charged with offering a comprehensive and holistic portrait of America's racial history. The Pulitzer Prize-winning 1619 Project by Nikole Hannah-Jones offers an important template in this regard, but one that -- even as it has been debated among historians -- has also been attacked on ideological grounds by conservatives and neo-Confederates for being overly critical of the nation's long political and cultural embrace of White supremacy."}
{"original": "A major lesson of 2020 is that the past is not past. Relics and artifacts of White supremacy -- from Confederate monuments and flags to statues of generals who wanted racial slavery to continue forever -- still help shape the present, including policies that disenfranchise Black voters that were first promoted during the Reconstruction era."}
{"original": "America's racial history remains, now more than ever, deeply contested. President Donald Trump's appointment of a 1776 Commission to teach patriotic education in our school systems attests to this. It is past time for national leadership that helps us clearly establish our past in all of its complexity. Understanding, for instance, racial slavery's expansive reach -- North and South -- into the creation of American capitalism gives students, citizens and leaders a more holistic appreciation of the stubborn afterlife of structural racism . The stickiness of America's current racial divide is rooted in a history that we continue to distort, gloss over or ignore at our very nation's peril."}
{"original": "Second, 2021 must see a coordinated effort at the local, state and national levels to eradicate the thousands of racist policies that keep too many Black Americans at the bottom of the well of this society. Criminal justice reform is the tip of the iceberg on this score. Eliminating the cash bail system and disparate sentencing for crack versus powdered cocaine, releasing non-violent drug offenders and transforming a juvenile justice system that disproportionately harms Black children should be at the top of the policy agenda."}
{"original": "And we mustn't stop there. The national racial healing that many long for cannot be purchased on the cheap. This commission must endorse and devise strategies to pursue policies for a living wage, housing reform, mental health and education programs and a universal basic income."}
{"original": "They must look to provide affordable health care for every American. While some major Democratic candidates for president in 2020 favored a Medicare for All plan , President-elect Joe Biden has vowed instead to add the public option to Obamacare -- reviving a measure that failed to pass in 2010. But we are long past the time for policy tinkering with the health of Americans. Of those who insist that Medicare For All is unaffordable we should ask another question: How can we afford not to? Medicare For All would increase jobs, employment and tax revenue through massive public investments that could increase worker productivity, economic mobility and ensure that families and children's health care would not be tied to a single job or eliminated amidst a pandemic."}
{"original": "This commission would work closely with governors and mayors at the state and local level to establish priorities, design implantation strategies, and innovate solutions that are based on the challenges, wants, and needs of grassroots communities across the nation."}
{"original": "The commission must explore targeted programs to repair the purposeful injury to Black Americans caused by racial slavery, Jim Crow bigotry, inequality in federal housing policies and the GI Bill and predatory lending during the Great Recession."}
{"original": "Third, racial healing requires more than anti-racist hashtags from corporations, sports teams, philanthropists and public officials. Leaders in tech, philanthropy and higher education, along with elected officials, must pledge concrete action toward racial justice and equity, with measurable indicators of progress and accountability. The technology, finance capital and entrepreneurship sectors, in conjunction with local, state and federal government could invest in eco-systems that prioritize wealth creation, talent development and access to capital in Black communities on an unprecedented scale."}
{"original": "2020 will exist in American and world history as a watershed: the shared trauma of a global pandemic unfolded alongside Black Lives Matter demonstrations and a political reckoning with racism's grip on American life. This year served as an inflection point that illuminates the challenges ahead for a new presidential administration in Washington and the collective hopes and will of the nation."}

Every city, town and hamlet in the nation should look inward at their histories of racial inequality, acts of truth-telling that can form the basis for local, state, and regional policy solutions that can pave the way toward healing and reconciliation across the nation."}

{"original": "While we can never know everything, there are times when ignorance can cost you dearly -- and tax season is one of those times. Here are seven tax misunderstandings Americans should clear up immediately."}
{"original": "A pile of little papers on which are written words such as tax return tax audit tax advice -- and many simply have big question marks on them"}
{"original": "1. You shouldn't necessarily want a fat tax refund."}
{"original": "For starters, while it's wonderful to get a hefty check from Uncle Sam after filing your tax return, that's not really such a great thing. After all, it's technically your own money that you're getting back, and the government has been hanging onto it until you filed your return. Modest refunds are common and not a problem, but big refunds generally happen when we have too much withheld from our paychecks. You can adjust your withholding by submitting another W-4 form to your employer."}
{"original": "2. Tax credits are more valuable than tax deductions"}
{"original": "Tax credits and deductions aren't the same thing. Both offer tax breaks, but tax credits are more powerful."}
{"original": "A deduction reduces your taxable income. Have gross income of $70,000 and a $4,000 deduction? Your taxable income is now $66,000. If you're in the 25% tax bracket, you avoid being taxed on that $4,000 and save $1,000. If you have taxable income of $70,000 and a $4,000 tax credit, however, the credit reduces your tax dollar-for-dollar. It's worth a full $4,000."}
{"original": "Credits are available for all kinds of things, such as education expenses, the adoption of children, and the care of children and dependents. A particularly valuable credit, if your income is low enough to qualify, is the Earned Income Tax Credit, which might shrink your taxable income by more than $6,000. The Child and Dependent Care Credit offers a credit of up to $3,000 for the care of one eligible dependent and up to $6,000, total, for two or more."}
{"original": "3. You do have to report all income"}
{"original": "It can be easy to think that you only have to report income to the IRS that you get documentation for in the mail -- such as via a W-2 form or a 1099 form. Not true. You need to report all income, from rental income to prize money to gambling winnings. If you get paid in cash for some or all of the work you do, that, too, needs to be reported."}
{"original": "You should report all income because it's the right thing to do, but also because the IRS may already know about some income you're not reporting, and it will wonder why you're not reporting it. After all, entities that pay you will very often be reporting that expense to the IRS."}
{"original": "4. You can't get an extension for paying your taxes"}
{"original": "Many people misunderstand the nature of a tax extension. When you file IRS Form 4868 for an extension, you are only postponing the filing of your return. You can't postpone paying the taxes that are due. That might sound tricky, as you may not know exactly how much you owe if you haven't yet completed your return, but the IRS expects you to make a good-faith estimate and pay that amount. (If you think your total taxes due will be around $15,000 and $12,000 was withheld by your employer, you would send in the difference, $3,000.)"}
{"original": "The IRS imposes penalties for filing a late return and for paying taxes late. Penalties can be as much as 25% of the tax owed and the unpaid tax. Even if you can't pay, file your return. And if you can pay at least some of what you owe, do so, to minimize the penalty hit."}
{"original": "5. You can reduce your chances of being audited"}
{"original": "Your chances of being audited are very low -- and were recently less than 1 in 100. Don't think it's all a matter of chance, though, because there are factors that can make an audit more likely. For example, if you have earnings that are well above average, you'll be more likely to have your return audited. If you're self-employed, you'll be more likely to be audited, as well, because it can be easier for a self-employed person to fudge numbers than it is for a salaried person."}
{"original": "Factors more under your control that can keep your audit odds low include being neat and legible when filling out your return, reporting all income on it (including all dividends and interest that's reported on 1099 forms), and not having math errors on it that will draw the attention of the IRS. If you report having no income at all, the IRS might question that -- which is not a problem if you really did have no income. It may also question bigger-than-usual deductions such as for charitable donations or business expenses. Again, such deductions might get you audited, but they won't cause much trouble if they're legitimate and you have documentation to back them up."}
{"original": "6. You have rights as a taxpayer"}
{"original": "You might feel powerless against the IRS, but you do have rights. There is a Taxpayer Bill of Rights that was adopted by the IRS in 2014, assuring us the right to be informed, the right to quality service, the right to pay no more than the correct amount of tax, and the right to challenge the IRS, among others"}
{"original": "There's even a Taxpayer Advocate Service, headed by our National Taxpayer Advocate, Nina Olson. Ms. Olson regularly informs Congress of problems she sees in our tax system and makes recommendations for fixing them. Her office also helps thousands of taxpayers with various problems every year."}
{"original": "7. The IRS will not phone you"}
{"original": "Finally, the IRS is never going to call you out of the blue -- and it won't send out unsolicited email, either. If you receive a phone call, as many people have, from someone saying they're with the IRS and that they need you to make a payment immediately or they need your Social Security number or bank account or credit card numbers, don't believe them. There are many tax scams out there bilking taxpayers out of money."}
{"original": "Getting your personal information can help a scammer engage in identity theft -- filing a tax return in your name and collecting a refund. The IRS is aware of and has been tackling this problem, and in fiscal year 2015, it initiated 776 identity theft related investigations, resulting in 774 sentencings. Working behind the scenes, in the first nine months of 2016, it reduced the number of people who filed affidavits with the IRS saying they were victims of identity theft by almost half, compared to 2015 -- with affadavits dropping from 512,278 to 237,750. Still, be warned and be wary."}

{"original": "Friday may be the first test of how the Justice Department will handle some of these issues. Lawyers will be in court in Washington, DC, for a case involving the House Ways & Means Committee's attempt to obtain Trump's tax returns from federal agencies that have them. Trump broke with the tradition of a president voluntarily disclosing his tax returns."}
{"original": "At stake is whether the Biden administration will back out of legal proceedings making their way through the courts in which Justice Department lawyers under the former President tried to protect Trump and others."}
{"original": "The Senate has not yet set a hearing date for Biden's nominee for US Attorney General, Judge Merrick Garland, so it's not clear how quickly decisions on these cases will be made."}
{"original": "The Justice Department serves as the lawyer for government agencies and Office of the President in civil litigation, such as defending executive orders, policies, and fights over executive privilege."}
{"original": "(CNN) Historians face a daunting task when it comes time to assessing Donald Trump's presidency, during which news often moved at breakneck pace, and the ramifications of his one-term presidency have yet to be determined."}
{"original": "CNN spoke with nine historians who largely agreed that Trump's final year in office -- mainly, his failure to properly respond to the pandemic and his incitement of a mob of rioters at the US Capitol -- has done more to cement Trump's legacy than the first three years of his presidency. In addition to his Covid-19 response and the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, Trump's handling of his first impeachment Senate trial, racial justice protests following the death of George Floyd and other Black Americans and his challenge to the 2020 election represents his time in office boiled down to a year, they said."}
{"original": "Trump has set himself apart for his style of communication, including freewheeling speeches and speaking off the cuff in an informal manner. He threw out personal insults, cursed publicly, and regularly repeated mistruths. He used Twitter to govern and issue directives, appeal directly to his supporters, and spread conspiracies. He amplified the cultural wars, stoked racial divisions, and emboldened right wing extremism."}
{"original": "He vilified judges and courts for rulings he disliked, railed against the deep state and worked to undermine US intelligence agencies, attacked his own Cabinet members, and waged war against the oversight of his own administration by firing agency watchdogs. A recent directive from Trump makes it easier to push out career officials from the federal government and replace them with loyal political appointees."}
{"original": "The Trump legacy is an exhausted, divided, bruised country with strained institutions, Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian for CNN, said."}
{"original": "Jeff Engel, a presidential historian and author of Impeachment: An American History, told CNN that he doesn't think that anything that President Trump did this year surprised anyone -- either his supporters, or his detractors, or neutral critics."}
{"original": "What he managed to do over the first three years was to genuinely reveal who he was and everything the last year has just deepened the color palette for that portrait, Engel said."}
{"original": "US President Donald Trump takes off his facemask as he arrives at the White House upon his return from Walter Reed Medical Center, where he underwent treatment for Covid-19."}
{"original": "The coronavirus pandemic, upending all facets of American life, has consumed not only contemporary analysis of Trump, but also has shaped how the 45th President will be perceived long term, Engel said. As of Sunday, Covid-19 had claimed the lives of nearly 400,000 Americans and infected more than 23 million in the US, according to data from Johns Hopkins University"}
{"original": "If you had asked me before the pandemic, I probably would have talked a lot about the tax cuts, deregulation, even immigration, Julian Zelizer, a history and public affairs professor at Princeton University and a CNN contributor, said. The pandemic swept up the country and defined what was going on. And so by definition, everything he has done this year will be elevated beyond anything in the first three years."}
{"original": "Such a health crisis would have challenged any American president, but Trump downplayed the pandemic as it spread, pushed unproven treatments, flouted health recommendations, maligned his government's health experts and politicized mask-wearing. His government worked expeditiously to develop a Covid-19 vaccine in record time, which is being touted as a remarkable scientific achievement. But Operation Warp Speed has fallen behind meeting expectations in administering doses to Americans."}
{"original": "Historians told CNN that the vaccine accomplishment has to be weighed against Trump's other decisions in handling the Covid-19 pandemic."}
{"original": "Trump, Engel said, had an opportunity to rise to the challenge and change the narrative of his presidency, and one of the things every President needs in order to go down in history as a significant or great president is a great crisis."}
{"original": "January 6 -- a 'defining' day"}
{"original": "Historians also told CNN that Trump's legacy will be marred by his refusal to concede the 2020 presidential election and advancement of misinformation and distrust in the American electoral process. All that crescendoed to January 6 -- in a violent mob of pro-Trump rioters who breached the US Capitol and demanded that Congress stop its certification of the 2020 election, which Trump lost to President-elect Joe Biden."}
{"original": "Those images will endure, have left profound damage on our democratic processes, and will define the Trump era, said Laura Belmonte, a history professor and dean of Virginia Tech's College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences."}
{"original": "Kathryn Brownell, an associate professor at Purdue University, told CNN that January 6 was a culmination of the ways in which Trump, supported and enabled by many in the Republican Party and in conservative media, has flagrantly flouted laws and norms over the course of his presidency."}
{"original": "The attack on the Capitol, Brownell said, with the encouragement and direction of President Trump, was shocking and unprecedented. It revealed the extent to which America's dark and violent history of white supremacy continues to threaten democracy today, just as it has for centuries -- something that historians have repeatedly highlighted not just in the past week, but over the past five years."}
{"original": "A week later, enraged by the January 6th events and threat to democracy and their lives, the US House voted to impeach Trump for incitement of insurrection -- making Trump the first president in US history to be impeached twice."}
{"original": "Trump's first impeachment -- for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress -- in December 2019 and acquittal by the US Senate in February 2020 may be viewed as a just something between commas in a long list of bizarre moments and breaking of norms, Engel said."}
{"original": "US President Donald Trump holds up a Bible outside of St John's Episcopal church across Lafayette Park in Washington."}
{"original": "Historians say that there's any numbers of ways that Trump shattered norms of the American presidency and politics, but Belmonte is not convinced much of Trump's legacy will be terribly enduring. She argued that Trump lacks a signature legislative achievement comparable to Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act or George W. Bush's No Child Left Behind Act."}
{"original": "Presidential historian H.W. Brands told CNN that it's too soon to tell what Trump's most lasting legacy will be but that if Trump had won reelection, then his novelties might have become new standards."}
{"original": "Trump weakened the confidence of other countries in American leadership, but confidence can be restored. He challenged the legitimacy of elections, but the recent election took place, the votes were counted, and the winner is going to be the next president, Brands told CNN in an email."}
{"original": "History scholar Lindsay Chervinsky, author of The Cabinet: George Washington and the Creation of an American Institution, told CNN that the turnover in Trump's Cabinet has been un-paralleled in American history and is perhaps one of the most unprecedented things about his presidency."}
{"original": "Johns Hopkins University history professor Martha Jones and others told CNN that the Trump administration's zero tolerance policy that led to thousands of migrant children separated from their families, will certainly be revisited and have historians grappling with how it's possible the policy was permitted. His targeting of legal immigration and birthright citizenship will also be memorable, Jones said."}
{"original": "Barbara Perry, the director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, told CNN that a definite lasting impact will be Trump's reshaping of the federal judiciary and US Supreme Court, by appointing three justices and giving America's highest bench a 6-3 conservative-liberal majority . And time will tell whether Trump's most lasting legacy was the diminution of American democracy, she said."}

{"original": "Trump backers may also point to his administration's peace negotiations in the Middle East, his tough stance on China, and his withdrawal of American troops from overseas such as Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. Trump has removed the US from several international organizations and abandoned multilateral treaties including the Paris Climate Accord, the Iran nuclear deal, and the World Health Organization. He insulted the US' closest allies , while he cozied up to and praised dictators"}
{"original": "Trump doesn't leave behind a Trump doctrine and hasn't left a structure in place that could be pointed to later as this is the Trump contribution to America, said Naftali, who argued that Trump's America First will not survive his administration."}
{"original": "As the White House has declared the Trump doctrine to be that terrorists lose and peace wins, historians argue that Trump's foreign policy approach has damaged the US' global standing."}
{"original": "While some of the historians CNN interviewed say that President-elect Joe Biden may be able to repair some of that damage, others such as Chervinsky believe it will take the US years and decades to try and restore trust among its allies."}
{"original": "The loss of trust both domestically and internationally for the United States, for our institutions and our elections will probably be the most significant legacy, because that kind of thing takes so many decades to get back, Chervinsky said. Our international standing has really suffered."}
{"original": "US President Donald Trump raises his fist at the end of a rally to support Republican Senate candidates at Valdosta Regional Airport in Valdosta, Georgia."}
{"original": "An important part of Trump's legacy, Zelizer said, is what he revealed about where the Republican Party was in 2020 and his exposure and aggravation of some of the most controversial and sometimes destructive elements of the GOP."}
{"original": "Zelizer and others told CNN that as historians weigh Trump's legacy, they'll return to the question of how Trump managed to retain solid support within the Republican Party and his base despite his behavior and actions."}
{"original": "Every time he pushed the envelope on what would've been considered normal behavior, not only -- he didn't pay a price for that politically very often, and indeed that just seemed to make his supporters that more deeply entrenched, Belmonte told CNN. And that's something I think that's going to take years for historians to piece out. What was the reason that there is this incredibly powerful loyalty to this President, irrespective of what he does?"}
{"original": "Historians also believe that Trump's legacy will be determined by the direction the Republican Party takes once Trump exits the political stage and how the GOP restructures itself."}
{"original": "Elections are one way that presidential reputations are defined, Naftali said, and the midterm elections in 2022 and the presidential primaries in the 2024 election could all be indicators of the Trump legacy."}
{"original": "The extent to which Trump will matter and remain a political influencer, Naftali told CNN, also depends on how many young ambitious politicos in this country look to his brand of leadership as a way to gain power. And that's a legacy that you can't describe yet."}
{"original": "Already, the potential field of Republican presidential candidates for 2024's GOP primary is starting to shape up, with some hopefuls angling to inherit Trump's voter base."}
{"original": "Republicans are going to help define Trump's legacy and I can't predict how that will go, Naftali said, adding that it depends on the political success of people who are carrying the Trump banner."}

According to a 2015 report by the Center for Popular Democracy, 68% of black women and 72% of Latina women work in hourly positions, which are most prone to volatility, compared to 58% of white women. Overall, 61% of all women in the US workforce have jobs that pay by the hour, including 83% of those who work part time; most of these jobs pay less than $15/hour, and part-time jobs rarely provide any benefits."}
{"original": "Just as the Young family tapped into their retirement account to help smooth over their loss of income, savings are frequently the first line of defense against hardship when a household's budget is out of balance."}
{"original": "Yet, according to recent research from the Federal Reserve, 40% of households couldn't come up with $400 in an emergency – an amount well below the conventional recommendation to have enough cash on hand to cover three to six months of living expenses."}
{"original": "These narrow margins mean that families are at constant risk of even minor changes in their income or expenses inflicting deep material and financial consequences. Researchers have coined the term heat or eat, for example, for the tension created in the winter months by increasing utility costs against the relative flexibility of a household's food budget, which can result in increased hunger and lack of adequate nutrition."}
{"original": "Moreover, when families can't cut back on costs, they take on debt, which can make rebounding harder in the long run. Surveys of middle- and low-income households show higher uses of credit cards to cover basic living expenses, such as rent or utilities, than their higher-income counterparts, and carry a balance that accrues interest, adding to their financial burden."}
{"original": "Though conservatives traditionally embrace savings as a product of thrift and self-reliance, the President and congressional Republicans have made common cause of widening the hole that working-class families have in their pockets – while concentrating the flow of federal resources that help families build savings and wealth into the hands of those who already have it."}
{"original": "Gone, for example, is the so-called Fiduciary Rule requiring that financial advisers offer conflict-free advice that is in their clients' best financial interest and not for their own financial gain. According to the Obama administration's Council of Economic Advisers, approximately $17 billion was being siphoned from families by their financial advisers each year. The rule aimed to target the loss. And, hamstrung and under constant assault is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has worked to return nearly $12 billion to consumers from predatory actions by the financial industry."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, the $1.5 trillion tax reform package passed at the end of 2017 made clear the GOP's priority for subsidizing existing wealth over helping financially fragile families gain a foothold."}
{"original": "Analysis from Prosperity Now shows that the richest .1% of taxpayers stand to gain nearly $200,000 annually, primarily through preferential treatment of investment income, compared to less than $1,000 for middle-income households."}
{"original": "Distilling the view that this disparity is driven by differences in individual character rather than outcomes created by public policy, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) weighed in on a proposal to repeal the estate tax during the debate by telling the Des Moines Register in 2017: I think not having the estate tax recognizes the people that are investing, as opposed to those that are just spending every darn penny they have, whether it's on booze or women or movies."}
{"original": "Though he later said that his quote was taken out of context, the sentiment it reflected was codified into law. The final bill doubled by the value of exemption for individuals with estates valued over $11 million (or, $22 million per couple), impacting only the wealthiest .2% of estates."}

{"original": "New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and allied progressive groups are ramping up their push for a Green New Deal."}
{"original": "The initiative came to national prominence after Ocasio-Cortez joined young activists from the Sunrise Movement at a protest in then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's office during orientation for incoming House freshman last year."}
{"original": "Ocasio-Cortez, the Justice Democrats, a progressive group that recruited the Bronx-born New Yorker to run, and Sunrise are now poised to throw their organizing muscle behind the ambitious suite of policy proposals, which would move the country toward 100% renewable energy through a series of economic reforms, including a jobs guarantee and heavy public investment in low or no-carbon infrastructure like light rail for commuters."}
{"original": "Movement leaders do not agree on a price tag. Estimates run in the hundreds of billions of dollars, or more. But they argue a combination of tax hikes on the super wealthy – Ocasio-Cortez has floated a 70% rate on income over $10 million – and cuts to fossil fuel industry subsidies and military spending, in addition to the stimulative effects of the new public spending would offset any cost."}
{"original": "As part of the new outreach, organizers will train volunteers – online and in-person at a series of events this spring – to more effectively confront elected officials and ask for their support. The Road to a GND Tour was drawn up as a traveling pressure campaign designed to secure the support of political leaders, from mayors and city council members to federal lawmakers, around the country."}
{"original": "The idea of a Green New Deal has, in just a few months, become a central piece of Ocasio-Cortez's agenda and attracted the attention of ambitious national Democrats."}
{"original": "I am thrilled to see so many of the potential 2020 presidential candidates embracing the idea of a Green New Deal, Ocasio-Cortez told CNN. The oil and gas lobbyists won't back down without a fight and that's why we need to support groups like Sunrise Movement in their efforts to keep the pressure up. When the scientific consensus says that you have 12 years to avoid climate catastrophe, it's time to get to work."}
{"original": "Those efforts are also now slated to include a large scale demonstration outside one of the first Democratic presidential primary debates, where Sunrise organizers are hoping that thousands of young activists will gather to demand the candidates onstage back the program. So far, Sens. Bernie Sanders, Jeff Merkley, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker have – to varying degrees – offered their support."}
{"original": "Ocasio-Cortez's efforts on Capitol Hill have so far met with mixed reactions from even liberal lawmakers. Her request to establish a committee specifically focused on developing and advancing a Green New Deal mostly fell flat with Democratic leadership, which has instead empaneled a Select Committee on the Climate Crisis to be chaired by Florida Rep. Kathy Castor."}
{"original": "Castor came under fire from climate activists and some progressive Democrats after telling E&E News in December that she would not deny seats on the panel to members who had accepted donations from the fossil fuel industry, calling it a First Amendment issue. She has since backed off that position and pledged, in a subsequent interview with Sludge, to forswear those contributions herself. But the committee is not expected to have subpoena power, a sticking point with progressives who want the authority to compel energy executives to appear under oath."}
{"original": "Democratic leaders had an opportunity to embrace young people's energy and back the Green New Deal, but they failed us once again, Sunrise co-founder Varshini Prakash said in a statement. In 2019, we're going to talk to the millions of young people scared about climate change and get them organizing to demand that every congressional and presidential candidate back the Green New Deal."}
{"original": "Sunrise, along with Ocasio-Cortez and the Justice Democrats, are concerned that the committee itself is not committed to addressing climate change issues over the 12-year timeline addressed in the detailed and dire October report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change."}
{"original": "I don't want to see my own district under water and I know that Leader Pelosi doesn't either and I know that what we need to show her is we're here to back her up in pushing for 100% renewable energy, Ocasio-Cortez told CNN during the November sit-in at Pelosi's office. This is to show that we are here to back up bold action and that, you know she will be supported in that."}
{"original": "In response, they are also threatening to launch or back more aggressive primary challenges in 2020 to Democratic members who oppose or stay silent on the Green New Deal."}
{"original": "We're going to recruit Democratic primary challengers for House races in 2020 who will fight with us, said Alexandra Rojas, executive director of the Justice Democrats, and we'll keep putting pressure on Democrats in Congress and those running for President in 2020 to support the Green New Deal."}

Any advice? --Hector Rivas, Orlando"}
{"original": "We get it. It's tough to put away money for long-term needs when you're young and trying to enjoy life. But Hector is smart to be focusing on his future, especially now that he has a well-paying job."}
{"original": "In finances and in life, we all have to balance living well today while planning for a more secure future, says Patrick Amey, certified financial planner at KHC Wealth Management."}
{"original": "Yes, a 401(k) plan is the go-to retirement savings account for most workers. But if you're employed at a company that doesn't offer a 401(k) or any other retirement plan, don't worry. There are other options."}
{"original": "1. Create an emergency fund first"}
{"original": "The first step is to create an emergency fund that will cover three to six months of expenses, even before you start saving for retirement. It's critical to set aside money in case you lose your job, or have some other unexpected expense like a medical bill or urgent home or car repair."}
{"original": "The biggest financial mistake that I see people make is that they do not have an adequate emergency fund, says Patrick Lach, investment adviser with Lach Financial."}
{"original": "Hector is doing the right thing by stashing away $200 to $500 per month into a regular savings account, and he should keep doing that until he has enough to cover his expenses for several months."}
{"original": "One way to make it easy is to have your paycheck divided between a checking and a savings account, explains Cynthia L. Turkington, certified financial planner and owner of Fair Trust Financial. Once your money goes into your checking account, set up an automatic payment to divert a portion into a savings account, before you have a chance to spend it."}
{"original": "2. Look to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA)"}
{"original": "Once you've got emergecy funds covered, it's time to move onto retirement savings. Without the option to invest in a 401(k), the next best tax-advantaged way to do this is through an IRA. There are two main types of IRAs: A Roth IRA and a traditional IRA."}
{"original": "For Roth IRAs, contributions are made with after-tax dollars and future withdrawals are tax free. It's a pretty sweet deal, but in order to qualify, you need to be earning less than $133,000 ($196,000 if your married). Traditional IRAs are tax-deductible in the year you make the contribution, but most withdrawals are taxed at ordinary income tax rates."}
{"original": "So which one is right for you? If you're very young and far from retirement, there's a good chance you don't earn very much so you're in a lower tax bracket. If that's the case, the Roth IRA may make more sense."}
{"original": "If he/she invests aggressively, they could benefit from decades of tax-free growth, said James H. Saulnier, a certified financial planner based in Fort Collins, Colorado."}
{"original": "But if you're salary is pretty high and you're in a higher tax bracket, or you just make too much to qualify for a Roth, the traditional IRA is the way to go, says Sean M. Pearson, a certified financial planner and associate vice president at Ameriprise Financial Services."}
{"original": "The downside is that no matter which IRA you go for, you're limited to contributing no more than $5,500 for the year (you can throw in an extra $1,000 once you turn 50). That's significantly less than what employer-sponsored plans like 401(k)s allow."}
{"original": "This is a great option for someone who is young, just starting out, has no current retirement savings and is concerned about cost and complexity."}
{"original": "MyRAs are designed to be a starter account that will keep your money in super-safe investments with a guaranteed rate of return, and they're easily transferable to a regular IRA once you've built up some savings."}
{"original": "MyRAs are free to open and can be funded with as little as $2. You can set up automatic payments and withdraw the money any time you want without penalty. They're also backed by the U.S. government."}
{"original": "It's a great way to open what I call a 'starter' Roth IRA, says Saulnier."}
{"original": "4. Don't forget about the Health Savings Account (HSA)"}
{"original": "Some financial planners say a health savings account is the best-kept secret of retirement savings. That's because HSAs are the only savings vehicles that offer a triple tax benefit. Contributions you make are pre-tax, which means they lower your taxable income. The money grows tax-deferred while it's in the account, and withdrawals you make are tax-free as long as the funds are used for medical expenses."}
{"original": "The drawback of an HSA is that you must have a high-deductible health insurance plan to be eligible to contribute to one. But if you are, think of an HSA as a great tool to boost your retirement savings."}
{"original": "No matter where you save your money, the most important thing is that you're saving."}
{"original": "A good rule of thumb is to save 10% of your income for retirement, says Pearson. If 10% is too high for you, start by saving every penny you can."}
{"original": "But if saving isn't on your mind at all right now, spend less than you make, simple as that. You don't need a retirement account to do it, says David C. Haraway, certified financial planner and president of Substantial Financial."}

{"original": "Alas, Kansas City's gambit didn't work."}

{"original": "That's how Charlotte pitched itself in a video proposal for Amazon's second headquarters, in which the city played up its appeal to millennials."}

{"original": "(CNN) Following the violent storming of the Capitol by pro-Trump demonstrators, Democrats are preparing for an unprecedented second impeachment of Donald Trump. The argument for impeaching him is relatively straightforward: that he incited an insurrection and, as demonstrated last Wednesday, he remains a threat to the stability and national security of the country."}
{"original": "It is imperative that there should be some consequence for Trump's behavior. The question for Americans now is how best to impose them. Predictably, opponents of impeachment have argued both that there is simply too little time remaining in his term , but also that impeachment would further destabilize a highly polarized country."}
{"original": "Because Trump's term expires in only a few days, the issue of timing cannot be ignored. it would be difficult to complete the impeachment and removal from office process before noon on January 20, when Joseph Biden will become president."}
{"original": "However, the substantive point that impeachment would not allow the country to move forward is deeply flawed. It suggests the choice is between either moving forward toward restoring some kind of normalcy or remaining focused on the Trump era and adjudicating the past."}
{"original": "This choice is false. The only way we can move forward and restore rule of law is by having some kind of process to document what occurred during the Trump era, how it culminated in violence that left five dead and ensuring that it has consequences for those responsible."}
{"original": "Failing to do this would send a message that inciting people to take to the streets of Washington, DC for a wild protest that led to them breaking into the Capitol, threatening the lives of those inside and disrupting one of the most important functions of government -- ensuring that the winners of elections are able to take office -- is somehow not that big of a problem."}
{"original": "The question of whether or not to impeach Trump is best understood as part of the need for a larger transitional justice process following the end of his administration. One of the unintended consequences of another impeachment, which could even occur after Trump leaves office , is that by focusing the inquiry too narrowly on the soon-to-be former President, the public would pay less attention to the role that others in the administration may have played in facilitating these events."}
{"original": "A post-Trump presidency impeachment which, as some have called for, includes a ban on him seeking office again, might bring premature and incomplete closure to this ugly chapter of American democracy."}
{"original": "There can be little doubt that the country remains polarized and that, despite comments from some prominent Republicans , no consensus has emerged about either the riot at the Capitol or the Trump presidency more broadly. This is what makes the idea of moving forward and not revisiting the Trump era so appealing."}
{"original": "However, burying the avarice, corruption, alleged crimes and democratic rollback that characterized the Trump presidency because a large, loud and at times violent minority does not see it that way only lets the problems and polarization fester further."}
{"original": "By contrast, learning the truth about the last four years and holding key actors responsible is essential to restoring the rule of law, the integrity of our political institutions and to meaningful movement beyond the Trump era."}
{"original": "This approach might satisfy some critics of Trump who just want to see more people from the President's circle in prison, but the bar for convictions on all of these charges is high."}
{"original": "Additionally, high-profile criminal cases such as those involving tax write-offs would be unlikely either to bring the country together or shed enough light on what occurred over the previous four years. Moreover, a narrow focus on indictable federal crimes would not be a sufficient reckoning with the impact of the Trump years."}
{"original": "Another possible approach would be to establish high-level inquiries similar to truth and reconciliation commissions that have been convened in countries like South Africa. Ideally, these would be chaired by respected retired leaders from both parties and including representatives from sectors like civil society, the military, clergy and activist groups."}
{"original": "It might be best to establish one large commission to look into the entire administration. Another approach would be to establish several smaller commissions. There might, for example, be one on the January 6 insurrection, one focusing on the administration's catastrophic mishandling of the Covid-19 crisis, one on allegations of corruption in the Trump administration and perhaps others as well."}
{"original": "Get our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook"}
{"original": "The primary functions of these commissions would be to record what occurred during the Trump presidency and to articulate ways to balance the need for legal consequences with the need to move forward."}
{"original": "The commissions could begin to do this by taking statements and testimonies from witnesses, experts, people who worked in or close to the administration and even those effected by the policies and missteps of the administration. This information could be rapidly shared with the American people through commission websites and various media platforms."}
{"original": "It is critical that these commissions not only establish the fact of what occurred during the Trump years, but that they are empowered to recommend indictments as well."}
{"original": "It is true that America must move forward, but it's dangerous to believe that it can only do that by ignoring the recent past. American democracy can only be rebuilt and strengthened when we begin by processing not just how close we came to losing it, but the extent to which not just one man, but many around him, including the leadership of one of our major political parties, may have contributed to that."}

{"original": "Gillette, Wyoming (CNN) This Wyoming coal town is a place of contradictions. At dawn, the land looks heavenly: Winds rattle the sagebrush; cotton-candy skies make a dusting of snow glow in pastel hues. Later in the afternoon, though, you look to the horizon and see the Earth hemorrhaging gray dust as trucks haul coal from pits the size of suburbs."}
{"original": "Gillette is the hub of a region called the Powder River Basin, which produces roughly 40% of US coal . West Virginia's coal country gets more attention, but Wyoming produces more coal at this point. Gillette is the town that powers America -- at least it did for decades."}
{"original": "But as the urgency of the climate crisis has become more apparent, markets have shifted toward cheaper and cleaner electricity sources -- wind, solar and natural gas. Residents here know that the Biden administration, which rejoined the Paris Agreement on climate change and p romises a 100% clean electric grid by 2035 , could help push Gillette out of existence."}
{"original": "Moving away from coal is essential to fighting back against worsening droughts, storms and sea-level rise around the world. That fight will only get harder if America keeps burning coal."}
{"original": "To some degree, Gillette understand this. It's a place that simultaneously calls itself the  Energy Capital of the Nation  while also planning for a future in which the fossil fuel industry may not exist."}
{"original": "I drove here in January after Steve Gray, a 56-year-old resident who's been laid off from both the coal and oil industries in northeastern Wyoming, left CNN a voicemail after the 2020 presidential election. I've been exploring your questions about the climate crisis as part of an ongoing series for CNN Opinion , and Gray's message seemed to bring up some of the toughest questions concerning what must be a rapid transition away from fossil fuels."}
{"original": "Everybody in this town is afraid that it is going to become a ghost town, he said."}
{"original": "Steve Gray called CNN concerned that, following the election of President Biden, that Gillette could become a ghost town. He says he was laid off from an oil field job in 2015, then subsequently from another job in oil and then one in coal last year."}
{"original": "Implicitly, Gray seemed to be asking: What will happen to Gillette -- and other fossil fuel towns -- as the coal industry recedes and clean-energy goals are realized? And what difference could the Biden administration or Congress make for a dying town built on coal?"}
{"original": "Climate advocates tend to lump solutions to all of these issues under an umbrella term: just transition . Not like, just get on with this transition already. Just as in fair."}
{"original": "Gray, the man who called CNN, doesn't see anything fair about it."}
{"original": "People are getting left behind, he told me."}
{"original": "He and others I met in Gillette want the rest of the country to realize that they've worked hard, for decades, to supply the United States with electricity. They didn't own the companies that got rich off the boom in coal and other fossil fuels -- companies that hid research showing the disastrous effects of climate change , or that funded disinformation campaigns."}
{"original": "The Wyodak power plant, located near Gillette, Wyoming, is powered by the Wyodak mine, which is the oldest continually operated coal mine in the United States, according to the Wyodak company website."}
{"original": "Working in an industry created by federal policies that failed to price carbon pollution -- that encouraged the mining of coal on land owned by the US government."}
{"original": "And now they're being asked to stop."}
{"original": "Both by markets, which value cheaper energy sources."}
{"original": "And, importantly, by climate advocates like myself, who understand, based on science that's been amassing for decades, that global warming poses an existential threat to humanity."}
{"original": "What do we owe Gillette and its workers?"}
{"original": "There's an important irony hidden in the story of Gillette."}
{"original": "The US government willed much of this place into existence."}
{"original": "This nudge came in a few forms. One was federal support for domestic energy production in the early 1970s -- a time when overseas markets were seen as volatile and problematic."}
{"original": "The Clean Air Act of 1970 and its 1990 amendments targeted, among other pollutants, sulfur dioxide, which is a component of smog and acid rain. Powder River Basin coal just so happens to be naturally lower in sulfur than coal found in Appalachia and elsewhere."}
{"original": "Before 1970, there were a few coal mines and oil rigs in the Gillette area, Robert Henning, director of a local history museum , the Campbell County Rockpile Museum, told me. We were standing in front of a wall-sized image of 1920s Gillette, which had the look of a sepia-tone Western outpost -- a dusty landscape with wooden fences and magnificent rolling hills on the horizon. Gillette was founded in the late 1800s as a railroad town -- named for a surveyor. But after 1970 and the Clean Air Act, Henning told me, the then-localized mining industry exploded."}
{"original": "In 1960, the population of Campbell County, which includes Gillette, was about 5,800."}
{"original": "By 1970, it had more than doubled -- to nearly 13,000."}
{"original": "During the boom, the town was so crowded and chaotic that some families lived in tents, said Jim Ford , a Gillette resident who advises local government agencies and non-profits on economic and energy issues. Ford told me that when he was a child, his elementary school adopted a two-shift schedule to accommodate all the students. One group started at 6:00 AM and went until noon. Then the other started, ending at 6:00 p.m."}
{"original": "Steve Gray told me that his family was one of the ones that came to the region to work in the fossil fuel industry in the early 1970s. His dad worked in the oil fields, and so did Gray, at least for a time."}
{"original": "That was when life was good. Work was free-flowing. Wages were high."}
{"original": "The coal in the Powder River Basin sits near the surface and is mined with giant trucks carrying shovels so big you can fit a large family inside. The scale of the operation is difficult to comprehend. Our largest mine is roughly 90 square miles, said Shannon Anderson , staff attorney at the Powder River Basin Resource Council, an environmental group."}
{"original": "But any boomtown worker knows that kind of growth can't last forever."}
{"original": "The year 2016 -- that was the worst of it, according to the mayor."}
{"original": "That was when the economy just collapsed."}
{"original": "The energy industries always have been boom-and-bust, but this was a big one, said Gillette Mayor Louise Carter-King, who keeps an image of her father, who also was mayor of Gillette, hanging behind her desk. Her roots in the community are deep, and her husband works in coal. From her office window, you can see one of two coal-fired power-plants puffing smoke into the sky. It was like a perfect storm because oil went down, coal went down, natural gas -- everything. The bust was caused primarily by lower natural gas and renewable energy prices, less demand from coal-fired power plants, which continue to close, and concerns about climate-change regulations, according to economists."}
{"original": "Mayor Louise Carter-King, the first woman mayor of Gillette, says she supports the United States rejoining the Paris Climate Accord. Her father, Herb Carter, framed in the background, served as mayor in the 1980s."}
{"original": "Most of the coal mined near Gillette sits on public land, meaning that the state government collects royalty payments and other taxes on its production. Wyoming doesn't have a state income tax and its property and sales taxes are notoriously low. Many years, well over half of the state's tax revenue comes from the coal, oil and gas industries."}
{"original": "After the bust, Carter-King said she knew Gillette would have rethink everything."}
{"original": "Gray told me that his call to CNN was influenced by how things fell apart with the oil and coal industries shortly before and after 2016, the year US voters elected President Donald Trump -- who'd promised to bring back  beautiful, clean coal . Nearly 90% of Campbell County residents voted for Trump again in 2020 . But you won't find too many people in Gillette who believe Trump kept his promises to coal workers -- or that it was even possible to keep them."}
{"original": "Wyoming coal production peaked in 2008 at 468 million short tons , according to the US Energy Information Administration. By 2016, it was 297 million tons, creeping down to 277 million in 2019, nearing the end of Trump's term. Last year's figures are not yet available, but the Covid-19 pandemic's impact on demand for energy is known to have contributed to widespread collapse in the energy industry."}
{"original": "The Wyodak power plant, located near Gillette, Wyoming."}
{"original": "Gray says he was laid off from an oil field job in 2015, then subsequently from another job in oil and then one in coal last year. His wife left him shortly after the first layoff, he said."}
{"original": "These days, Gray is working again, driving railroad workers to and from job sites -- part of a broader industry that supports the mines and fossil fuels. (Mayor Carter-King estimates most people's jobs in Gillette are linked to coal and other fossil fuel industries -- whether directly or indirectly). But Gray said that he's eaten through his savings."}
{"original": "My bank accounts were drained -- lost my house, all the repossessions, he said."}
{"original": "He's living on the razor-thin margins of a bust economy."}
{"original": "'The coal industry's on its last leg'"}
{"original": "Here's an inconvenient truth: Towns like Gillette tend to fail."}
{"original": "I asked economists, environmentalists and policy experts. None could provide a sunny case study -- the story of a town whose main industry didn't take the initiative to remake itself."}
{"original": "There's not a sterling example, said Jake Higdon , a senior US climate policy analyst at the Environmental Defense Fund who has contributed to several reports on fossil fuel communities."}
{"original": "Timber towns, auto towns, military town, mining towns -- the logical progression is toward ghost town status if the town isn't big enough, or industries aren't diverse enough."}
{"original": "Lynne Huskinson, a retired coal minor, looks over the Eagle Butte mine in Gillette, Wyoming. Huskinson says she was laid off in 2019."}
{"original": "In even trying to rebuild, then, Gillette aims to do something unprecedented."}
{"original": "That doesn't mean it's impossible. Maybe our chances of remaking our community in a generation -- so my kids have something to come back to -- are 10%, said Ford, the county consultant. But I know if we don't try, the chances are zero."}
{"original": "On a recent snowy morning, I dropped by Lula Belle's Café --  non-smoking as of 4/1/2020  -- near the railyard in Gillette. It's a welcoming, chatty kind of place -- fruit pies on display behind the diner counter. I wanted to learn whether people here were in denial about coal's demise."}
{"original": "Will the mines bounce back? No, said Doug Wood, a retired coal miner with a mustache that's twirls at the tips. The coal industry's kind of on its last leg."}
{"original": "Hundreds of train engines, used to transport coal, are parked in a train yards near Gillette, Wyoming."}
{"original": "I don't know if you're familiar with a TV show called 'The Jetsons?'"}
{"original": "I found that sentiment -- the coal part, not the Jetsons -- to be a common refrain in Gillette. Frankly, I was stunned by the degree to which the mayor, county development officials and people like Gray accept the unsettling facts of coal's decline."}
{"original": "Phil Christopherson, CEO of Energy Capital Economic Development , a local non-profit that's funded by industry as well as city and county government, told me that he hopes children who are growing up in Gillette 50 years from now won't even know that this was a coal town."}
{"original": "It's going to be a tough transition for this community, Christopherson said, and we're doing our best to prepare for that, so we still have a community here in five, 10 or 50 years."}
{"original": "While claiming it wants something new, local and state leadership continues to push coal products and technologies -- many of them expensive and unproven -- as the future."}
{"original": "You'll hear some people calling Gillette Carbon Valley -- as in the Silicon Valley of coal. Coal research, they say, is what's next. As are new and supposedly cleaner uses for coal."}
{"original": "One such project, called the Wyoming Integrated Test Center, or ITC, sits at the base of a coal-fired power plant -- painted blue and white as if it might blend into the sky."}
{"original": "Jason Begger, the project's managing director, told me to think of the site as an RV park for researchers interested in capturing carbon-dioxide pollution from the power plant and doing something else with it -- potentially sequestering the gas deep in the rock underfoot."}
{"original": "The idea is that if most of that CO2 pollution is captured and stored away somewhere, coal can keep burning, because it wouldn't contribute heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere. It's reasonable to place some hope in the technology given the fact that carbon pollution needs to reach net zero by about 2050 in order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. But carbon-capture and storage has proven to be costly and troublesome compared to alternatives."}
{"original": "Begger told me the world needs to recalibrate its expectations."}
{"original": "I have a 2-year-old daughter, and it's kind of like saying, 'Well, in 20 years, she'll be in the Olympics, he said. We [would] have to see if she can crawl and walk before signing her up for the Olympics."}
{"original": "The state has been trying coal-spending technology for years, said Anderson, the environmentalist, with little to no results. She says she remains very skeptical of it -- as do I."}
{"original": "Wyoming, meanwhile, also has some of the nation's greatest potential for wind energy, according to the American Clean Power Association, an industry group. PacifiCorp, the massive power company that is retiring some of its coal power plants in Wyoming , recently opened a large wind farm -- 520 megawatts, enough to power about 150,000 homes, according to Laine Anderson, the company's director of wind operations -- about an hour-and-a-half drive south of Gillette."}
{"original": "Yet, Wyoming is a rare state that also taxes wind power -- rather than incentivizing its production as a much-needed clean energy source."}
{"original": "Wyoming's leaders have done little to pivot our state's economy away from this volatile industry, the Casper Star-Tribune's editorial board wrote of coal in 2019."}
{"original": "Perhaps Gillette is less a place of contradictions than one of surprises."}
{"original": "Steve Gray lives in a small apartment complex near the highway. He answered the door on a recent blizzardy morning wearing a denim, pearl-snap shirt and fuzzy red slippers."}
{"original": "After his layoffs from the oil and coal industries, he lost the house he shared with his ex-wife and son, who is now 25. For a while, he moved back in with his father. But now here's here, and when he welcomes you in you can feel the pride he takes in the place."}
{"original": "On the living room walls are the portraits he's taken with his son, an oil field worker in a community south of Gillette, and Steve's grandchildren. In these photos, Steve wears his trademark cowboy hat, a broomstick mustache and a contented grandfather's grin."}
{"original": "Nearby, you'll find the military honors -- a Purple Heart and Bronze Star -- bestowed on his elder relatives. Gray says he, too, served in the Navy and he values service to country."}
{"original": "Steve Gray stands outside his home in Gillette, Wyoming. After the election, he called CNN concerned that his city could become a ghost town. He says he was laid off from an oil field job in 2015, then subsequently from another job in oil and then one in coal last year."}
{"original": "It's hard to talk here about a just transition for fossil fuel workers -- as if any transition for workers in dying US industries ever has been just. Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance , which aims to unite labor and environmental interests around the issue of a transition for dislocated fossil fuel workers, told me there's no justice in what happened to auto workers or timber workers -- or in what's happening to fossil fuel workers now."}
{"original": "We are insisting that policy makers pay attention, Walsh said. It is not acceptable to leave any workers or any communities behind. We have an obligation to fulfill to workers and communities that have powered this country for generations and have often paid a very stiff price in terms of the health of their environments and their people and their workers."}
{"original": "I agree with that sentiment. In seeking a transition away from fossil fuels -- which, again, is required by science if we want to continue living on a habitable planet -- we must learn from the mistakes of the past. That's the only way America can inch closer toward justice."}
{"original": "Among history's lessons, according to Walsh: The investments must be bigger than before."}
{"original": "Walsh advised the Obama administration on a grants program -- called the POWER+ Plan -- that aimed to help diversify the economies of coal towns in the Appalachian Mountains."}
{"original": "JUST WATCHED These are Biden's promises on the climate crisis Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH These are Biden's promises on the climate crisis 01:34"}
{"original": "That program and others failed to fully address the full needs of these communities, according to policy experts I interviewed. But there's a consensus emerging on what's needed now, including: job retraining, community college investments, wage replacement, healthcare extensions, pension extensions -- and jobs that help repair land scarred from decades of intensive mining. Advocates are, smartly, in my view, pushing the White House to create an office focused on this economic transition -- assisting fossil fuel communities and creating new jobs, according to advocates involved in these efforts."}
{"original": "Colorado recently took a step in this direction by creating an Office of Just Transition . Wyoming and other fossil-fuel states should do the same. And, importantly, it would be wise of the Biden administration to make good on its campaign promises to fight climate change aggressively -- getting to net zero emissions as soon as possible -- while also creating jobs."}
{"original": "Their focus should be on struggling towns like Gillette."}
{"original": "Listening to them -- and helping -- could be both a political and moral victory"}
{"original": "Wyoming is a state as red as they come."}
{"original": "President Joe Biden and the Democrats who now control Congress could earn respect, if not votes, for telling coal country the truth -- that coal must be phased out of the national energy mix, but that workers will not be left behind. That means they should get job training, health care, wage replacement and, when possible, jobs in the new industries that are popping up to replace fossil fuels. This suite of policy solutions is complex, but they must be taken seriously, and the discussion must forward the voices of fossil-fuel workers. Workers need to know that climate advocates respect and support them before we can move forward."}

{"original": "(CNN) President Donald Trump issued a raft of 11th-hour pardons and commutations early Wednesday that included his onetime political strategist, a former top fundraiser and two well-known rappers but not himself or his family."}
{"original": "The batch of 73 pardons and 70 commutations issued in the final hours of his presidency was expected, and is in keeping with a long-standing presidential tradition of exercising clemency powers at the last minute."}
{"original": "The list reflected a President keen on awarding pardons to his stalwart allies, an unusual number of whom have been swept up in corruption or lying charges."}
{"original": "The vast majority of the pardons and commutations on Trump's list were doled out to individuals whose cases have been championed by criminal justice reform advocates, including people serving lengthy sentences for low-level offenses."}
{"original": "But several controversial names do appear, including Steve Bannon , who has pleaded not guilty to charges he defrauded donors in a We Build the Wall online fundraising campaign. Trump had spent the past days deliberating over a pardon for the man who helped him win the presidency in 2016 and followed him to the White House. During his final hours in office there was a frantic debate underway behind the scenes on whether to grant Bannon a pardon."}
{"original": "One concern was Bannon's possible connection to the January 6 riot of Trump supporters at the US Capitol, according to a source familiar with the discussions."}
{"original": "Over the course of Tuesday, Trump continued to contemplate pardons that aides believed were settled, including for his former strategist. The President continued to go back and forth on it into Tuesday night, sources told CNN."}
{"original": "Other names included Tuesday were Elliott Broidy, a former top fundraiser for Trump's campaign who pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy relating to a secret lobbying campaign to influence the Trump administration on behalf of a foreign billionaire in exchange for millions of dollars."}
{"original": "The rapper Lil Wayne received a pardon after pleading guilty to a gun possession charge in Miami. Another rapper, Kodak Black, received a commutation after he pleaded guilty to a weapons charge."}
{"original": "Trump also offered clemency to Paul Erickson, the conservative political operative and ex-boyfiend of alleged Russian spy Maria Butina, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud and money laundering charges; Robin Hayes, a North Carolina political donor convicted of trying to bribe officials; Former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, convicted of federal charges including racketeering, extortion and the filing of false tax returns; William Walters, a professional sports gambler convicted of insider trading; and Aviem Sella, an Israeli air force officer who the US accused of being a spy."}
{"original": "Bob Zangrillo, the Miami developer and venture capitalist charged in the Varsity Blues college admission scandal, also received a pardon. None of the other parents caught up in the probe were pardoned."}
{"original": "Though neither Trump or members of his family were included on his list, Trump has until noon on Wednesday to issue any final pardons before leaving office."}
{"original": "Trump's final acts of clemency come after a scramble in recent days among criminal justice reform advocates and several White House officials to finalize the list and convince Trump to approve the actions. These pardons will undoubtedly be overshadowed by the slew of controversial ones Trump also issue in the same final batch on Tuesday."}
{"original": "While outgoing presidents typically issue pardons before leaving office, Trump has proven more willing to use his pardon power to brazenly reward political loyalty, the wealthy and well-connected and those who did not cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation."}
{"original": "The January 6 riots that led to Trump's second impeachment have complicated his desire to pardon himself, his kids and personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and a source close to the process said those are no longer expected."}
{"original": "After the riot, advisers encouraged Trump to forgo a self-pardon because it would appear like he was guilty of something, according to one person familiar with the conversations. Several of Trump's closest advisers have also urged him not to grant clemency to anyone involved in the siege on the US Capitol, despite Trump's initial stance that those involved had done nothing wrong."}
{"original": "After weeks focusing on contesting the election and reeling from the fallout of the January 6 insurrection, Trump finally snapped back to attention on pardons in recent days, one source said."}
{"original": "You couldn't get the President to focus on this, a source close to the process said of Trump in recent weeks. And then this weekend, he didn't have his Twitter, he didn't have all these other distractions."}
{"original": "Trump, who sank deeper into lame duck status in recent weeks, was reminded that his pardon power is one of the remaining undiminished aspects of his presidential power."}
{"original": "This source said Trump also resonated with cases in which individuals who went to trial got significantly more prison time than co-defendants who cooperated with law enforcement."}
{"original": "I don't think he likes when people get screwed just because they go to trial, this source said."}
{"original": "While Jared Kushner has been closely involved in pardons throughout his time at the White House, this source said that Ivanka Trump became much more closely involved in the push for pardons in recent days."}
{"original": "Together, Kushner and Ivanka Trump worked with the White House counsel's office and Justice Department while also working to convince Trump to support a series of clemency actions in the vein of criminal justice reform."}
{"original": "After meetings this weekend, Trump met again with his daughter, son-in-law and other White House officials on Monday to finalize the list of clemency actions."}
{"original": "New York (CNN Business) Georgia isn't just the center of the political universe. It's center stage on Wall Street, too."}
{"original": "The Peach State's Senate runoffs will decide control of the US Senate -- and that in turn will play a pivotal role in shaping the economic recovery as well as the investing environment."}
{"original": "It is impossible to overstate how critical these races are for fiscal, tax and regulatory policy over the next two years, Chris Krueger, policy analyst at Cowen Washington Research, told clients in a report Monday."}
{"original": "A sweep by Democrats would open the door to more powerful fiscal stimulus that the shaky economy may very well need. But it would also raise the risk of corporate tax hikes that investors despise."}
{"original": "Until recently, Republicans were expected to retain control of the Senate by winning at least one of the Georgia races."}
{"original": "However, the odds of the Democrats retaking the Senate have surged in prediction markets in recent days and weeks -- a point that investors are just awakening to. If Democrats sweep in Georgia, they will effectively control the upper chamber of Congress, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris casting the deciding vote to break any 50/50 stalemates."}
{"original": "Control of the Senate is a 50/50 chance in either direction, Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, wrote in a note to clients Monday."}
{"original": "Bettors on PredictIt , a prediction market, are paying just 55 cents to win $1 if the GOP keeps control of the Senate. That's down sharply from 87 cents on Election Day and 75 cents in late December."}
{"original": "Given the totally unprecedented nature of the election, Krueger said, the Georgia races are a jumpball."}
{"original": "The Senate outlook is being further clouded by the bombshell revelation that President Donald Trump pressured Georgia officials to find 11,870 votes that would reverse his loss in the state."}
{"original": "This doesn't help the Republicans at all, said Greg Valliere, chief US policy strategist at AGF Investments."}
{"original": "He added that Trump's efforts to cast doubt on the integrity of the election may have confused Republican voters in Georgia -- just when he needs them to vote."}
{"original": "US stocks surged after Election Day in part because Wall Street believed neither party would be firmly in charge of Washington. The thinking was that the incoming Biden administration would be blocked from implementing sweeping tax and climate policies by a GOP-led Senate."}
{"original": "However, Wall Street is now bracing for the possibility that there may be less gridlock in Washington than previously thought. And that has positives and negatives for investors."}
{"original": "Stocks fell sharply Monday and some analysts pointed to the uncertainty over Georgia as one of the culprits knocking down the previously red-hot market."}
{"original": "The possibility of Kamala Harris being a tiebreaker on any 50/50 vote makes investors nervous near-term, said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest."}
{"original": "Tax hike fears may be overdone"}
{"original": "The big fear for investors is that GOP losses in Georgia would pave the way for large tax hikes that not only eat into corporate profits but derail the recovery, too. In theory, Democrats could use budget reconciliation to enact sweeping policy changes with party-line votes."}
{"original": "But some analysts say fears of immediate tax hikes are overblown given the economic and political realities of the moment."}
{"original": "I don't sense a mood in Congress to move quickly on taxes until people are sure the economy has recovered, Valliere said."}
{"original": "Keep in mind that a 50/50 tie in the US Senate is hardly the blue wave that progressives hoped for. All 50 Democrats would have to approve legislation -- including moderates such as Joe Manchin of West Virginia."}
{"original": "Manchin would not be a rubberstamp for the Democrats, said Valliere."}
{"original": "Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management, agreed that Democrats may find it difficult to pass Biden's tax and spending proposals through very narrow Senate and House majorities. He added that Manchin is ideologically closer to moderate Republicans than he is to progressive Democrats."}
{"original": "How much more help for the economy?"}
{"original": "Unlike tax hikes, Democrats are likely to unite behind legislation that would provide more help to the Covid-ravaged economy."}
{"original": "Late last month, Congress finally passed a $900 billion federal relief package that provided aid to small businesses and households."}
{"original": "The worsening pandemic -- and the sluggish start to vaccine distribution -- suggest the economy may very well need more help in the coming months. But with Republicans out of the White House, the GOP is now signaling concern over the surging federal budget deficit. If the GOP retains control of the US Senate, there may be little appetite for another round of substantive federal aid."}
{"original": "A Democratic-run Senate could mean bigger stimulus will be on the way to ensure the recovery gets back on track, said Ally's Bell."}
{"original": "President-elect Joe Biden has called for $3 trillion in infrastructure spending to accelerate the economy and rebuild crumbling roads, bridges and airports."}
{"original": "Analysts have said Biden's plan is a real possibility if Democrats sweep in Georgia. If not, it may be difficult to convince Congress to spend even $1 trillion on infrastructure."}
{"original": "Investors would view big spending on infrastructure as a big positive for the market, said Bell."}
{"original": "All of this explains why Bell is betting that a knee-jerk selloff on Wall Street over a potential sweep by Democrats in Georgia could prove to be a buying opportunity for investors."}
{"original": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump and top economic officials pitched Senate Republicans on a payroll tax cut and other policy proposals meant to ease the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak during a closed-door lunch on Tuesday, but multiple sources told CNN no consensus was reached on the proposals."}
{"original": "Trump made the rare trip to Capitol Hill on Tuesday after promising major and dramatic economic steps. But while sources familiar with the lunch said a multitude of options were discussed, members emerged without a concrete plan."}
{"original": "After the hour-long meeting in the Capitol, where the conversation included proposals of payroll tax holidays for workers, targeted relief for hard-hit industries -- like airlines, cruise ships, restaurants and retail -- tax cuts to help small businesses better afford sick leave for their workers and other proposals, some GOP senators remained skeptical about quickly passing an expensive stimulus package."}
{"original": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said afterward that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, would have ball control on negotiations that could take place in the coming weeks and that Senate Republicans would defer to them to see if they could cut a deal."}
{"original": "Ultimately, it's a decision between the President of the United States and Speaker Pelosi because she has to get something through the House, explained Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, a member of the Republican leadership."}
{"original": "Several senators said the most pressing item for Congress to take up was passing a law to help certify additional masks for use in hospitals, a bill that's sponsored by GOP Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska."}
{"original": "Like this week. Like right now. Like yesterday, said Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana, who said there was hope the Senate would pass it this week."}
{"original": "Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, said that senators talked about a host of things we can do."}
{"original": "We talked about infrastructure, we talked about that specific problem right now with a law regarding the certification of those masks. We talked about, obviously, payroll tax relief, Johnson said."}
{"original": "He wants action, Johnson said about Trump. He realizes this is an extraordinary event and might require extraordinary action."}
{"original": "During the lunch, presentations were given by Mnuchin, Vice President Mike Pence, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, and Trump. But they were just a starting point as Republican members also threw ideas at the wall. It was a conversation, participants said."}
{"original": "Some Republican senators have been skeptical of a payroll tax cut, which would put extra cash into people's pockets in hopes of boosting the economy. Several lawmakers have questioned how effective it would be during the outbreak, when more people are being encouraged to stay home."}
{"original": "According to several sources familiar with the lunch, Trump floated the idea of a permanent payroll tax cut, but also weighed having a temporary cut that lasted for several months."}
{"original": "While some assumed it would be limited, Trump suggested he wouldn't want the tax cut to expire before the November presidential election, noting at one point that he would get credit from voters if it passed, according to one person familiar."}
{"original": "Regarding the idea of a permanent tax cut, Indiana Sen. Mike Braun later told CNN, It's probably something I wouldn't do."}
{"original": "One GOP senator said there was a discussion about a proposal to extend tax credits for small companies that want to provide family and sick leave to their employees, a key issue during the outbreak since some workers who don't get sick pay might refuse to stay home when they are ill if it means missing a paycheck."}
{"original": "The senator said they also discussed actions the administration could take on its own that would help the economy, like waiving the requirement that people make their estimated tax payments. The idea would be relatively inexpensive, the senator said, because interest rates are low and it would keep a lot of money in the economy that otherwise would have gone to pay quarterly taxes."}
{"original": "Trump's top economic advisers raised the idea of paid family sick leave and targeted relief for industries hardest hit by the outbreak, like hotels, airlines and cruise lines."}
{"original": "'I wish I had a list'"}
{"original": "A lot of Republicans emerging from the meeting were sensitive that the President is clearly troubled by the downturn in the stock market, a fact that was clear during lunch Tuesday. But, Republicans are also struggling to square the President's worries with traditional Republican orthodoxy that government intervention in the economy -- especially this early -- could be seen as a shift in GOP policy given some of the Republican backlash to the bailouts of 2008."}
{"original": "Sen. Pat Roberts, a Republican from Kansas, said he wished there had been a bit more detail about what was actually on the table."}
{"original": "I don't have a list. I wish I had a list, Roberts said adding that Trump was determined to get something done on the economy."}
{"original": "Sen. Richard Shelby, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said GOP senators asked Trump how the package would be paid for but they didn't get an answer."}
{"original": "Some Republican senators were still cautious about the idea of an economic stimulus even after Trump's sell. The bottom line is that some of these are not traditional Republican ideas. Mandatory paid sick leave, for example, isn't necessarily widely accepted within the GOP conference and the length and scope of the payroll tax cut was also considered controversial for some."}
{"original": "Braun said he was skeptical of a package of economic stimulus items that were aimed at propping up large corporations from the oil industry to the airlines."}
{"original": "You got to be careful even here that we aren't doing this based off of hysteria or overdramatization, he warned."}
{"original": "Braun added: If it is aimed at small businesses you know I would probably look at it differently. If it is trying to help an oil industry, then I think they can take care of themselves."}
{"original": "Leaving the lunch, Trump offered no details on the discussions, but said, You'll be hearing about it soon."}

{"original": "I'm 60, earn about $80,000 a year, but have only $75,000 or so in retirement savings. What can I do to improve my retirement prospects?--Linda"}
{"original": "There's no way to put a happy face on this. You are way short of the amount of savings someone of your age and with your income should have in order to be able to retire anytime in the near future and maintain your current standard of living."}
{"original": "The fact that you're a woman makes your situation even tougher, as you're likely to live several years longer than a man your age, which means your nest egg will have to support you that much longer."}
{"original": "So I don't want to be a Pollyanna and suggest that there are a few simple (or even not so simple) steps you can take over the next several years that will allow you to live the same retirement lifestyle you might have achieved had you been saving diligently and investing sensibly throughout your career."}
{"original": "Still, you can definitely improve your chance of having a more secure retirement than if you continue along your current path, although doing so will require you to put retirement planning at the very top of your list of financial priorities. You'll also have to commit to some significant lifestyle changes in years before you retire, and possibly afterwards."}
{"original": "Related: Do you need $1 million to retire? Maybe"}
{"original": "The two most important things you need to do are no secret. You know what I'm going to suggest, as does anyone who understands the basic dynamics of how retirement works."}
{"original": "The first thing is you've got to start shoveling money into retirement savings accounts like you've never done before. I'm talking big-time savings here. The second thing you'll have to do is stay on the job for quite a while, at the very least into your late 60s, longer if you can manage it."}
{"original": "Because the fact is that, short of winning the lottery, coming into an inheritance or being on the receiving end of some other windfall, the combination of ratcheting up your savings rate and remaining on the job is your best shot at achieving a relatively secure and comfortable retirement. And even if you do those two things (as well as the others I'll suggest) you'll still probably have to scale back your standard of living somewhat."}
{"original": "Normally, someone who's been saving throughout his career and is now in the home stretch to retirement would be stashing between 10% and 15% of pay into retirement accounts. Since you don't have the accumulated savings someone in that position would have, you need to get to the upper end of that 10%-to-15% range at the very least, and preferably push yourself to save even more."}
{"original": "So let's take a look at how much you might be able to accumulate. Assuming you save 15% a year, get 2% annual pay raises and earn a 5% yearly rate of return on your original $75,000 plus your annual savings, you would end up with a nest egg at age 65 of roughly $166,000. If you manage to put away 20% of your salary, you could be looking at a nest egg of about $190,000."}
{"original": "Clearly, that puts you in a lot better position than you're in now, but hardly on easy street. Assuming a 4% initial withdrawal subsequently adjusted for inflation, a nest egg of $190,000 would generate about $7,600 a year of sustainable retirement income, or about $633 a month. Certainly not enough to allow for living large."}
{"original": "The picture improves dramatically, however, if you continue to work and save beyond age 65. For example, save 15% a year and work until you're 70, and you could be looking at a nest egg of roughly $290,000. Save at a 20%-a-year rate, and you're talking about entering retirement with roughly $345,000 in savings."}
{"original": "Figure on an initial withdrawal rate of, say, 4.5% (higher than the age-65 withdrawal rate to allow for the fact that your money doesn't have to last as long), and a nest egg that size might produce annual income of just over $15,000, or nearly $1,300 a month, or about double the amount you would have saving 20% to age 65."}
{"original": "Working longer has another benefit besides allowing you to boost the size of your nest egg: It allows you to qualify for a larger Social Security check. Generally, your Social Security benefit increases roughly 7% to 8% for each year you postpone Social Security between the ages of 62 and 70. (You get no increase for postponing benefits after reaching age 70.)"}
{"original": "In your case, taking Social Security at 70 rather than, say, 65, would boost your Social Security benefit by more than 40%. In fact, you'd probably end up with an even larger increase after also taking into account the extra years of pay you earned (and paid Social Security payroll tax on) during that period. You can see how the combination of saving more and working longer can improve your outlook for retirement by going to this retirement income calculator."}
{"original": "Of course, saying you can save more and work longer and actually doing it are two different things. You clearly haven't been saving regularly throughout your career, so starting now, especially at a high rate, will be quite a shock. You've been living a lifestyle that depends on spending most of what you earn. You're going to have to exercise some willpower to make the transition to being a serious saver."}
{"original": "Similarly, even if you're willing, you may not be able to stay on the job as long as you prefer. For example, nearly four in 10 workers said they don't plan to retire until after age 65, according to a recent Gallup poll. At the same time, though, the Employee Benefit Research Institute's 2017 Retirement Confidence Survey shows that nearly half of retirees said they retired earlier than they planned, often because they had a health problem or had to care for a spouse or other relative or because they were simply ousted from their job."}
{"original": "Given the reality that you may not be able to continue working and saving as long you'd like, it's all the more important to push yourself to save as much as you can as long as you still have the opportunity."}
{"original": "Related: How do I figure out how much to save for retirement?"}
{"original": "There are other steps you may also want to take. For example, if you own a home, you might consider downsizing and/or taking out a reverse mortgage as a way to turn home equity into spendable cash that can supplement Social Security and draws from your savings."}
{"original": "You might also combine either or both of those moves with relocating to an area of the country that has lower living costs. This cost of living calculator can help you compare the cost of living in more than 200 U.S. cities."}
{"original": "One caution: Investing aggressively to earn higher gains may seem like a reasonable strategy to boost the size of your nest egg, especially since many pros expect investment returns will be lower in the years ahead than in the past. But such a move could backfire, leaving you vulnerable to big losses that may be difficult to bounce back from at your age. You're better off focusing on saving more and maintaining a reasonable balance between growth and safety in your retirement portfolio."}
{"original": "I'm sure you've gathered by now that improving your retirement prospects isn't going to be easy. But I have one final suggestion that may provide some motivation. Go to Social Security's Retirement Estimator tool and see what your projected Social Security benefit will be at various ages. And then ask yourself how you would feel having to live solely or even mostly on that monthly income after you retire. Ideally, the answer will spur you to take action to improve your retirement outlook as much as you can."}

{"original": "Story highlights There aren't many people in the senior GOP ranks who know what Donald Trump is thinking Republicans have often found themselves derailed by a Trump interview or tweet"}
{"original": "President-elect Donald Trump's foray into health policy was perhaps best described by a senior Republican congressional aide with a long history of working through the complexities of the issue as not helpful."}
{"original": "Trump's decision to weigh in – telling The Washington Post over the weekend that not only was he nearly done with his own Affordable Care Act replacement plan, but that it would provide insurance for everybody – at once riled Capitol Hill Republicans already in a sensitive position on the issue and underscored the fraught and unknown nature of a nascent relationship with Capitol Hill."}
{"original": "In a series of interviews with GOP lawmakers and staff over the course of the first two weeks of the new Congress, it's clear there is a genuine enthusiasm about the possibilities a Trump presidency presents. Years of fighting losing battles with the veto pen awaiting all of their priorities in the White House are now, in a few days, gone."}
{"original": "But any excitement is almost immediately hedged with some level of trepidation – there simply aren't many people, if anyone, in the senior GOP ranks who appear to have much insight into what Trump is actually thinking."}
{"original": "Repeatedly in the first few weeks, Republicans have found themselves derailed for a day, if not longer, by a Trump interview or tweet that appears to split with the agreed upon intentions or path of the conference on a given day."}
{"original": "Lawmakers are prone to roll their eyes when asked questions about Trump's tweets, pledge not to talk about them at all, as Sen. John McCain has done multiple times, or ignore Trump's latest surprise policy prescription entirely, as Sen. John Barrasso did Tuesday when asked about Trump's latest health care comments."}
{"original": "Oh yeah? said Barrasso, one of the Senate GOP's leading health care policy minds, when CNN asked his thoughts about Trump's statement. He proceeded to walk into a Senate hearing room and close the door."}
{"original": "House Speaker Paul Ryan has a direct line to incoming chief of staff and fellow Wisconsin Republican Reince Priebus, one he uses often, and has said repeatedly that he speaks to Trump by phone a few times per week. Even as Trump has appeared to diverge from Ryan and the House on his proposals, Ryan has steadily maintained there is no major daylight on the big issues."}
{"original": "We are in complete sync, Ryan told reporters after it appeared Trump was asking lawmakers to move on their Affordable Care Act replacement plan at a quicker pace than planned. And we agree, we want to make sure that we move these things concurrently, at the same time, repeal and replace."}
{"original": "But Ryan and House GOP leaders have a road map for their repeal and replace process: they did much of it in 2016. While that effort was rejected, whether it was through reconciliation – the budget mechanism that will allow Republicans to repeal large swaths of the law – or through piecemeal bills that address the remaining chunks of the law, there is a step-by-step legislative process on which they've already delivered results. All of which were either vetoed or died in the Senate."}
{"original": "The contents of Trump's Affordable Care Act replacement plan were – and are – a mystery, according to multiple GOP congressional sources. It's an element, needless to say, that to the extent it exists, wasn't expected to be part of their process, they said."}
{"original": "Ditto in the Senate, where senior GOP leaders are urging caution – and patience."}
{"original": "It's the art of the doable, said Senaet Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch. These things take time."}
{"original": "Sen. Lamar Alexander, the chairman of the Senate Health panel, told CNN he was interested in seeing what Trump and his team put together. When Alexander, who is one of a handful of central players in any replacement effort, was asked if he'd had any conversations with Trump or his team about their plan, he replied simply: I have not."}
{"original": "Even as Trump rattles off his policy goals in media interviews and via Twitter, he's largely left it to his legislative team to craft and execute those priorities on Capitol Hill, according to a transition official."}
{"original": "That team consists of Vice President-elect Mike Pence and Priebus – both of whom spent Tuesday in meetings on Capitol Hill – as well as the incoming deputy chief of staff for legislative affairs, Rick Dearborn. They've been working alongside Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell."}
{"original": "A transition official stressed that some of these policies are still in their initial stages and added that when Trump unexpectedly weighs in, he's not necessarily offering up a hard and fast policy proclamation. There's still room for negotiation – a point made with tax reform in mind specifically."}
{"original": "Trump stunned Capitol Hill Republicans when he appeared to reject the idea of a border adjustment tax in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. Just a week prior, Trump's top lieutenants, from Priebus, to son-in-law Jared Kushner, to chief strategist and senior counselor Steve Bannon, were on Capitol Hill for a nearly two-hour meeting over dinner largely focused on tax reform in Ryan's office. One person with direct knowledge of that meeting said Trump's apparent opposition to the idea never came up."}
{"original": "But in an admission that seems to encapsulate the frustration GOP officials will face repeatedly in the months ahead, a person familiar with the Trump team's internal discussions on the border adjustment tax even said that it's not the actual tax Trump objects to. But rather, Trump doesn't like framing his plan as a border adjustment tax."}
{"original": "Some of it's the marketing, this person said."}
{"original": "After Trump weighed in on the border adjustment tax his spokesman, Sean Spicer, downplayed the distance between the President-elect's policy visions and the legislation Republicans have been crafting on the hill."}
{"original": "I think we're having some serious – some discussions back-and-forth with key members of Congress, the House and Senate leadership. When we have something to announce, we will, Spicer said Tuesday. There's always a back and forth between the executive and Congress as to how to get this right."}
{"original": "The question, at least on the congressional side of the relationship, remains whether those back-and-forths will lead to firm agreement – or just something waiting to be undercut later by Trump himself."}
{"original": "Hatch, the Utah Republican who has been in the Senate for more than 40 years, chuckled when he was asked if he thought Trump was starting to understand the complexities of Capitol Hill."}

{"original": "Democrats are now considering whether to subpoena Cohen to compel his testimony before he reports to prison next month, and at least one senior Democrat on the House Oversight Committee said he expects Chairman Elijah Cummings of Maryland to issue a subpoena."}
{"original": "Due to ongoing threats against his family from President Trump and Mr. Giuliani, as recently as this weekend, as well as Mr. Cohen's continued cooperation with ongoing investigations, by advice of counsel, Mr. Cohen's appearance will be postponed to a later date, Cohen's attorney Lanny Davis said in a statement. Mr. Cohen wishes to thank Chairman Cummings for allowing him to appear before the House Oversight Committee and looks forward to testifying at the appropriate time."}
{"original": "Davis added, This is a time where Mr. Cohen had to put his family and their safety first."}
{"original": "A source told CNN on Wednesday that Cohen's wife and father-in-law feel threatened by comments by the President and Giuliani, Trump's attorney. It has been Cohen's intention to testify, but he has had reservations — and vacillated — because of concerns for his family given the Trump and Giuliani statements, the source said."}
{"original": "Cohen's decision raises questions about whether he will ultimately testify publicly. He reports to prison for a three-year sentence on March 6."}
{"original": "Asked Wednesday about Cohen citing threats against him and his family, Trump said: Well I would say he's been threatened by the truth. He's only been threatened by the truth."}
{"original": "Cummings told reporters that he believed Cohen was acting in good faith, but he was determined to have Cohen testify one way or another. Cummings said he hadn't decided yet whether to issue a subpoena."}
{"original": "I promise you we will hear from Mr. Cohen. Now, we will make those determinations soon and we will let you know how we plan to proceed, but we will get the testimony as sure as night becomes day and day becomes night, Cummings said."}
{"original": "Asked if he could get Cohen to testify after he's already in prison, Cummings said: Of course we can."}
{"original": "Cummings and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff – a California Democrat who wants Cohen to return to his panel for closed-door testimony – issued a joint statement slamming Trump and Giuliani for efforts to intimidate witnesses, scare their family members, or prevent them from testifying before Congress."}
{"original": "We understand that Mr. Cohen's wife and other family members fear for their safety after these attacks, and we have repeatedly offered our assistance to work with law enforcement to enhance security measures for Mr. Cohen and his family, Cummings and Schiff said."}
{"original": "Like Cummings, Schiff told CNN on Wednesday that he expects Cohen to appear before his committee. Schiff said he was prepared to subpoena Cohen if he would not testify voluntarily before he reports to prison."}
{"original": "When our Committees began discussions with Mr. Cohen's attorney, not appearing before Congress was never an option, Cummings and Schiff said. We will not let the President's tactics prevent Congress from fulfilling our constitutionally mandated oversight responsibilities. … We expect Mr. Cohen to appear before both Committees, and we remain engaged with his counsel about his upcoming appearances."}
{"original": "After Cohen's public testimony was announced earlier this month, the President attacked him in a Fox News interview, suggesting without evidence that he was aware of damaging information about Cohen's family."}
{"original": "Then on Twitter, the President added: Lying to reduce his jail time! Watch father-in-law!"}
{"original": "Giuliani appeared on news shows over the weekend, including CNN, where he called Cohen a serial liar. On CNN's State of the Union, host Jake Tapper asked Giuliani how Trump's repeated calls for investigation into Cohen's family members ahead of Cohen's previously scheduled testimony did not amount to intimidating a witness or obstruction of Justice."}
{"original": "We are so distorting the system of justice just to get Donald Trump, it's going to hurt us so much, Giuliani responded. When Tapper asked if it was OK to go after Cohen's father-in-law, Giuliani responded, it is, if the father-in-law is a criminal."}
{"original": "In December, Trump was asked in a Fox News interview about Cohen's cooperation with special counsel Robert Mueller, and he suggested that Cohen had cut a deal to keep his wife out of trouble, as well as his father in law."}
{"original": "The following day, Cohen said Trump was wrong in an ABC News interview."}
{"original": "Inaccurate. He knows the truth, I know the truth, others know the truth, and here is the truth: The people of the United States of America, people of the world, don't believe what he is saying, Cohen said. The man doesn't tell the truth. And it is sad that I should take responsibility for his dirty deeds."}
{"original": "But prosecutors in New York had threatened Trump's ex-lawyer with numerous more counts that could have also implicated his wife and also raised the possibility of his assets being seized, CNN has reported."}
{"original": "In the Manhattan US Attorney's case against Cohen, he pleaded guilty to five counts of tax fraud related to his taxi-medallion business. Cohen's taxi business was linked closely to his family members, including his father-in-law, Fima Shusterman, from whom Cohen bought some medallions, CNN previously reported. Shusterman, who emigrated from Ukraine, pleaded guilty in 1993 to a financial crime relating to the taxi business, according to court records."}
{"original": "During the course of his taxi medallion purchases, Cohen and his wife took out several loans of unspecified value, putting up the medallions as collateral, according to CNN reporting.

{"original": "I believe Chairman Cummings will institute the process of subpoenaing, Lynch said. He is conferring with other members of the committee right now, but so far I believe the overwhelming consensus is we should move forward with a subpoena."}
{"original": "Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat on the committee, said he hadn't spoken to Cummings yet but supported a subpoena so the public would hear his story."}
{"original": "I would support the issuance of a subpoena, however reluctantly, Connolly said. This is not a reluctant witness, at least up until now, and the reason for his reluctance isn't our committee, it is the client he fears puts his family at risk."}

{"original": "GOP rivals point fingers in South Carolina debate Candidate face-off is last before Saturday primary COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN) -- The final debate before Saturday's South Carolina GOP primary was marked Tuesday by accusations of negative campaigning, and the three remaining rivals answered questions on such stalwart Republican issues as tax cuts, the death penalty, abortion and nuclear arms. The free-flowing format of the debate, which was moderated by CNN's Larry King, led to several lively repartees between Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Arizona Sen. John McCain and former Ambassador Alan Keyes, who, when they were not taking aim at one another, fired shots at President Bill Clinton. It's kind of politics, Bush said of the negative turn the South Carolina campaign has taken. Saying he had let the other candidates define him in the campaign's early days, Bush vowed: I'm not going to let it happen again. And unfortunately you ran an ad that equated me to Bill Clinton, he said to McCain. That's about as low a blow that you can give in a Republican primary. There was an ad run against me, we ran a counter ad in New Hampshire, McCain shot back. Then I was beat up pretty bad by his surrogates comparing me to Clinton, 'Clinton lite,'  McCain said, running through the campaign's negative twists and turns. This is an attack piece, Bush said as he held up a flyer he said was placed on a voter's windshield. That's not by my campaign, McCain insisted."}
{"original": "Well it says 'paid for by Sen. John McCain,' Bush said. You can disagree with me on issues, John, but do not question my trustworthiness and do not compare me with Bill Clinton. Keyes, who badly trails both candidates in the polls, spent much of the night saying that such squabbling was not what voters want. You say this is being transmitted to 200 countries and all I'm sitting here listening to is these two guys going on about their ads? he said. The problem, he said, stemmed from the fact that people are trying so hard to be all things to all people ... so they get into this spitting match over who did what to whom. When asked about tax cuts, both Bush and McCain defended their proposals. The difference between Gov. Bush's proposal and mine is I put a whole lot into shoring up Social Security and paying down the debt, and he puts a whole lot into tax cuts, McCain said. It's not the Washington mentality -- it's the grown-up mentality, McCain said of his $240 billion tax cut plan. The plan, he said, would pay off the debt and provide tax cuts to low- and moderate-income Americans while saving Social Security. If we have a debt, we ought to pay it off, McCain said, vowing to veto any bill that increases spending if elected president. I won't just be a hapless bystander."}
{"original": "I don't trust Congress; I trust people and I want to give people their money back -- grown-up or non-grown-up, Bush said. Either you trust the people or you trust government. His five-year, $483 billion tax cut plan would spend more of the surplus on tax cuts than McCain's. On the same day that Democratic presidential front-runner Al Gore received the endorsement of a major abortion-rights group, the Republican rivals argued over who was the most anti-abortion candidate. The political questions around abortions are these and this is one that's gonna differentiate us from the Democratic nominee, Bush said when McCain questioned him on his pro-life stance and whether he supported the right to an abortion in cases of rape, incest or to preserve a woman's life. I will sign a ban on partial-birth abortion, Bush said of a controversial late-term abortion procedure that Congress has twice passed and the president has twice vetoed. We need to keep the platform the way it is, bush said of the GOP plank that calls for a consitutional amendment banning abortion. The Texas governor reaffirmed his support for the death penalty when asked whether he would follow the lead of Gov. George Ryan (R-Illinois), who suspended executions in the state after 13 death row inmates were found innocent. Bush insisted that every inmate executed on his watch was guilty."}
{"original": "There's no doubt in my mind that each person who has been executed in my state was guilty of their crime, he said, adding that if someone's innocent they shouldn't be put to death. All three candidates support the death penalty, but the Texas governor, by nature of his office, is the only candidate to have presided over executions. When the question was posed to McCain, he said that DNA technology would provoke a review of certain cases, but I certainly wouldn't abandon the death penalty. The death penalty is appropriate punishment as penalty for some crimes, McCain said."}
{"original": "Living on a fixed income poses a significant challenge for many retirees. Unless you're willing to work part-time in retirement, once you leave your career behind, your options for generating extra cash will be limited at best. That's why it's critical to stretch your existing budget to the greatest extent possible. Here are a few ways to reduce your expenses in a big way."}
{"original": "That large house and yard undoubtedly served you well when you had kids living under your roof, but if you're an empty-nester with more space than you know what to do with, it may be time to consider downsizing."}
{"original": "The average homeowner spends 1% to 4% of his or her home's value on annual maintenance and repairs, but if you trade in your current home for a smaller one, you might slash your expenses in half. After all, it's cheaper to heat and cool a 1,500-square-foot house than a home twice that size, and maintaining a modest backyard is far easier than mowing and trimming a much larger property."}
{"original": "Remember, while you may be used to tackling home maintenance yourself, thus keeping your costs to a minimum, as you age, your ability to do so might decline. Furthermore, as homes age, they tend to require additional maintenance, thus adding to your overall expense. If you move to a smaller space and manage to find one better in better condition, you might save yourself thousands of dollars in upkeep year after year."}
{"original": "If you live deep in suburbia, going without a car probably isn't an option. But if you reside in a city, or live with a partner who also has a vehicle, getting rid of one car could make a major difference in your finances."}
{"original": "AAA reports that it costs about $8,700 a year to own a vehicle, but even if your car is fully paid off, you'll still have insurance, maintenance, and repairs to deal with. If you have other options for getting around, unloading a vehicle could put over $700 back in your pocket each month."}
{"original": "3. Enroll in Medicare on time"}
{"original": "Though coverage under Medicare begins at age 65, your initial enrollment window opens three months before the month of your 65th birthday and ends three months after the month you turn 65. But if you fail to sign up during that seven-month window, you could end up paying more than you need to for Medicare Part B, which covers doctor visits and diagnostic services. Specifically, for every 12-month period you go without coverage upon becoming eligible, you'll be penalized in the form of a 10% increase in your Part B premiums."}
{"original": "Signing up late for Medicare Part D, which covers prescription drugs, can also cost you. If you go 63 days or more without coverage, you'll face a penalty equal to 1% of the national base beneficiary premium -- which is currently $35.63 -- times the number of months you go without coverage. Signing up 20 months late, for example, will add $7.10 per month to your Part D premiums. It pays to arrange for Medicare coverage in advance so that you don't wind up paying more than you need to."}
{"original": "Tempting as it may be to take advantage of those early-bird specials, if you're looking to save money in retirement, dining at home is a good way to do it. The typical restaurant charges a 300% markup for the food it serves, which means a $15 entree can usually be prepared for a mere $5 at home. While dining out on occasion can be a worthwhile treat, the more you cook at home, the less you'll spend on food overall."}
{"original": "When we think about living expenses, we tend to consider everyday necessities like groceries, electricity, and clothing. But taxes can be a significant expense for seniors as well. Thankfully, there are a number of tax breaks available to seniors that can result in some serious savings."}
{"original": "If you're still working, contributing to a Roth IRA is one of the best ways to lower your taxes in retirement. That's because Roth IRA withdrawals aren't subject to taxes, nor are you required to take them at any given point in time. Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, by contrast, impose required minimum distributions starting at age 70 1/2, and once you're forced to remove funds from a non-Roth account, you'll be subject to the taxes that go along with them."}
{"original": "Another good option for lowering your taxes is taking advantage of the medical expense deduction. Currently, you can deduct out-of-pocket medical costs that exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income (AGI). This means that if you spend $10,000 a year on healthcare and have an AGI of $60,000, you can deduct any amount above $6,000 -- which, in this case, is $4,000. Since medical care is the one expense that tends to universally go up among seniors, it pays to track your spending and keep impeccable records so that you know what sort of deduction to claim."}

{"original": "With just a month to go before the first votes for president are cast in Iowa and New Hampshire, TV audiences are being treated to an onslaught of 30-second attack ads as candidates smear each other with the help of ominous narrators, grainy footage and foreboding music."}
{"original": "Yet Donald Trump, the party's undisputed front-runner for six months, remains the only candidate unscathed so far."}
{"original": "Here's a look at some of the most recent spots."}
{"original": "Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have been tussling for months, first over each other's immigration stances and now over national security."}
{"original": "RELATED: As negative ads pile up in Iowa, Ted Cruz plots a bigger footprint"}
{"original": "On Monday, the super PAC backing Cruz released a new spot to paint Rubio, who has been dogged by questions about his Senate attendance record, as unserious. Using footage from a lighthearted video Rubio made, in which he jokingly confuses fantasy football players with presidential candidates of the same name, the attack ad lists various threats against America before cutting to video of Rubio discussing fantasy football. The ad is set to run in Iowa for two weeks and is intended to blunt any potential last-minute surge by Rubio ahead of the caucuses."}
{"original": "Rubio, for his part, has been less aggressive going after Cruz on the airwaves in Iowa, instead devoting his focus to New Hampshire. But in stump speeches and interviews, Rubio frequently criticizes Cruz for his vote to reform the NSA surveillance program, which Rubio argues removed a valuable tool from counterterrorism efforts, and has used the vote to characterize Cruz as soft on security."}
{"original": "And a super PAC backing Rubio, Conservative Solutions, released an ad Tuesday touting Rubio's electability that calls him the one Hillary Clinton doesn't want to run against, an attempt to tweak Cruz over concerns about his general election viability due to his hardline conservatism."}
{"original": "Cruz isn't the only candidate with whom Rubio is locking horns."}
{"original": "This week, the Florida senator's team released a flurry of attack ads against New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, just as the brash governor is threatening Rubio's status as the GOP establishment's preferred candidate."}
{"original": "Rubio's super PAC, Conservative Solutions, put up two ads in New Hampshire, blasting Christie over his record in New Jersey. The first calls Christie Obama's favorite Republican governor and criticizes his support for an Internet sales tax, the Common Core education initiative and 'liberal energy policies."}
{"original": "The second ad slams Christie for his unpopularity in his home state, and describes his term as governor in five words: High taxes. Weak Economy. Scandals."}
{"original": "Christie's team is hitting back. In a speech Monday, he pitched his experience as a prosecutor and governor to New Hampshire voters, and argued that challenging times call for someone who has been held responsible and accountable for their decisions, not someone who just changes the next vote if the last one didn't work out. The address was a not-so-subtle dig at congressional rivals such as Rubio who, as Cruz is all too eager to remind people, changed his position on immigration reform."}
{"original": "Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum are hoping that strong showings in Iowa – where they won the 2008 and 2012 caucuses, respectively – will help sustain their campaigns."}
{"original": "And as they woo social conservatives and evangelicals in the Hawkeye State, they're taking aim at Cruz."}
{"original": "An ad from Santorum's campaign this week seeks to do this by contrasting the former Pennsylvania senator's tenure with Cruz's. A narrator recounts Santorum's achievements before cutting to video of Cruz reading Green Eggs and Ham during his 2013 filibuster over Obamacare."}
{"original": "Huckabee's supporters, meanwhile, have adopted a sharper tone, with his super PAC, Pursuing America's Greatness, releasing an ad titled Two Teds. The attack attempts to paint Cruz as two-faced about his conservative values, using audio of Cruz at a New York City fundraiser saying that fighting gay marriage would not be a top priority of his administration."}
{"original": "The two Republicans' attempts to damage Cruz reflect their campaigns' understanding that their best bet at a long-shot run depends on a strong finish in Iowa – and that Cruz's strength in Iowa makes that unlikely. Whether or not the attacks help Santorum or Huckabee, though, they could hurt Cruz enough to widen the lane for middle-tier candidates such as Rubio and Christie."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, Trump, who overwhelmingly leads the rest of the GOP field according to a CNN/ORC poll released late last month, has received his share of flak from other candidates and the groups supporting them, even if they've failed to dent his seemingly impenetrable poll numbers."}
{"original": "The Kasich campaign and his super PAC, New Day for America, stepped up their attacks against Trump, releasing a TV spot last month mocking Trump's days peddling a name-brand steak line. In November, the group released a spot effectively comparing Trump to Hitler and the Nazis, and the PAC is spending $2.5 million in attack ads against the real estate mogul in New Hampshire."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, the super PAC backing Jeb Bush, who has tried to position himself as an experienced alternative to Trump, called the real-estate mogul reckless and impulsive in a 30-second spot last month. But Bush's efforts have had little effect, leading Trump to taunt him last week by saying he wasted $40 million."}
{"original": "Trump himself has not issued any attack ads on TV, though he's gone after candidates in short video clips on Instagram. But the brash billionaire has vowed to return fire with a flurry of negative ads if he comes under attack."}
{"original": "(CNN) The White House is keenly aware of the Republican objections that have arisen to President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus proposal , but they are urging Democratic allies to be patient for the moment, according to two administration officials."}
{"original": "Biden has spent the last several days on the phone with lawmakers in both parties, and his team has started a blitz in recent days not only to walk through the proposal with lawmakers and staff, but also listen to their concerns and potential proposed changes."}
{"original": "One key meeting between National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and a group of 16 bipartisan senators will take place on Sunday. But more are planned -- and Biden himself is expected to be an active player in the days and weeks ahead."}
{"original": "The President has made clear to his team that we should be reaching out to members of Congress from both parties to make the case for the rescue and engage with them and understand their concerns, Deese told reporters during a briefing on Friday."}
{"original": "It all underscores the message from the top -- the preferred route is a bipartisan one, and Biden still believes there is a pathway to at least 10 GOP votes for a relief proposal. What that proposal looks like, however, is obviously subject to negotiation, one official said. In other words, the $1.9 trillion proposal is an opening bid."}
{"original": "They know they aren't going to get everything in their proposal, one Democratic official who has worked on the measure told CNN. That's the point here -- it's supposed to be a negotiation."}
{"original": "But growing increasingly antsy about prospects for a bipartisan deal, Senate Democrats have been laying the groundwork to use a rare procedural tactic known as reconciliation to pass major parts of the Covid-19 relief package if Republicans stand in the way, according to multiple Democratic aides."}
{"original": "While leadership has yet to give the go ahead publicly and negotiations with Republicans are still getting started, aides tell CNN that the process is complicated and arcane, which is why they are getting ready now in case they have to use it."}
{"original": "You just can't do this overnight, one Democratic Senate aide said referring to why the process is already starting."}
{"original": "And more directly, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told donors on a Zoom call Thursday that she wanted to pass the Covid relief bill in two weeks using budget reconciliation, a source familiar told CNN."}
{"original": "While the Biden administration's first goal is to pass its nearly $2 trillion plan with bipartisan support through the regular Senate process, the odds are long for winning over enough Republicans to pass another massive stimulus bill just months after a more than $900 billion package passed the Senate in December. Already, many Republicans have signaled they think the package is too expensive or even unnecessary at this point."}
{"original": "We just passed $900 billion worth of assistance why we would have a package that big now? Maybe a couple of months from now, Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, said. The needs will be evident, and we will need to do something significant. But I'm not seeing it right now."}
{"original": "For their part, the Biden administration has started to meet with Republicans they've identified as potentially supporting the package in an effort to build support."}
{"original": "I had a pretty good walkthrough of their Covid proposal, Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who is up for reelection in 2022, told reporters earlier this week. It was an opportunity for me to ask some questions."}
{"original": "But Biden's team has publicly made clear they aren't willing to take any tools off the table -- a direct reference to the budget procedure that would allow them to move forward with a simple majority."}
{"original": "It's a moment that requires decisive action to beat this pandemic and support the economic recovery that Americans need, Deese said."}
{"original": "Behind the scenes, lawmakers recognize time is of the essence and are preparing to work through reconciliation if they have to. Chairs of the House and Senate Budget Committee have not been shy about talking publicly about their plans."}
{"original": "The caucus would prefer this be done on a bipartisan basis. We haven't made a decision yet to use reconciliation, but we are prepared to move very quickly if it looks like we can't do it any other way, Rep. John Yarmuth, a Democrat from Kentucky and the chairman of the House's Budget Committee, said Thursday."}
{"original": "Hours later, Sen. Bernie Sanders, the chair of the Senate Budget Committee, told NBC's Seth Meyers that the first goal was to try to reach out to Republicans, but he argued they couldn't wait for them to come along."}
{"original": "I think we should reach out to Republicans if they choose not to come on board, which I suspect will probably be the case ... we should use that majority in a very aggressive way, Sanders said. It is my view we should make sure that we address the needs of the American people in that reconciliation bill, and if we pass it with 51 votes, we'll pass it with 51 votes."}
{"original": "The first step would be to pass a budget bill through committee to essentially unlock the process. Once that was finished, the Senate Democrats could rework Biden's bill so it fit into a very specific framework of what is allowed under the process. Reconciliation requires that anything passed has a real impact on the budget and not just an incidental one. The process also requires that proposals have no impact on social security and that the impacts on the budget do not stretch beyond a 10-year window if the changes are permanent. Because the process requires jumping through so many hoops and consultation with the Senate's parliamentarian, committee staff have been working for weeks now to make sure they understand and are ready for the process in case it has to be used."}
{"original": "There's not much room for error, another Democratic aide said noting that the committees will have to go point by point through Bidens proposal to see what can fit in reconciliation."}
{"original": "Republicans used the reconciliation process when they attempted to repeal and replace Obamacare in 2017 in the Senate. The GOP successfully used the process months later to overhaul the country's tax code, which passed with just Republican votes."}
{"original": "The conversations about reconciliation have been reinvigorated in recent days as Democrats have grown frustrated by the stalled negotiations to organize the Senate . Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has dug in and insisted that Majority Leader Chuck Schumer agree to preserve the filibuster for the next two years. The filibuster protects the minority party in the Senate by requiring that legislation meet a 60-vote procedural threshold before passing. Schumer has argued that policy has never been part of an organizing resolution before, but the issue has delayed the process of setting up committees and passing Biden's nominees."}
{"original": "There are still questions about what parts of Biden's Covid relief package would be allowed to advance under reconciliation. Some aides have identified that items like the $15 minimum wage could struggle to meet the criteria."}
{"original": "But White House officials make clear the real negotiation hasn't even started yet -- and that Biden, with decades of legislative work and relationships in the Senate, plans to give it time and space to come to fruition before moving in another direction."}

{"original": "But it's complicated -- this is a country where local property regulations are often tangled up in byzantine legalities."}
{"original": "And, of course, it's a place where attitudes towards foreign incomers are sometimes ambivalent, as highlighted by a recent rise in political hostility towards economic migrants arriving from Africa and the Middle East."}
{"original": "The latest deal to beat them all comes from Giovanni Bruno Mattiet, the mayor of the tiny Alpine village of Locana, in Piedmont, the mountainous northwestern region of Italy that borders France and Switzerland."}
{"original": "He's willing to pay up to €9,000, or $10,200, over three years to families willing to move in and take up residency amid snowy peaks and flower-strewn pastures, as long as they have a child and a minimum annual salary of €6,000."}
{"original": "Our population has shrunk from 7,000 residents in the early 1900s to barely 1,500 as people left looking for a job at Turin's big factories, Mattiet tells CNN Travel. Our school each year faces the risk of shutting down due to few pupils. I can't allow this to happen."}
{"original": "l e v a r t"}
{"original": "In Locana each year there are 40 deaths versus just 10 births. It's a familiar picture across Italy where, in the last 30 years, one in four small communities have become ghost towns . There are now 139 villages with fewer than 150 residents."}
{"original": "And while Mattiet's deal was initially offered just to Italians or foreigners already living in Italy, he's now so desperate to save his town from dying, he's extending it to non-Italians abroad too."}
{"original": "We're looking to draw mostly young people and professionals who work remotely or are willing to start an activity here, he says. There are dozens of closed shops, bars, restaurants and boutiques just waiting for new people to run them."}
{"original": "The town may be small but it's wealthy, thanks to the clean hydroelectric energy it sells to Italy's state."}
{"original": "With the money comes a great location. Locana's territory spreads across 132 square kilometers of the Gran Paradiso mountain reserve, offering fresh air and outdoor activities like ice-skating fishing, trekking, rock climbing, swimming, soccer and tennis."}
{"original": "Picturesque Alpine dwellings are made of stone and wood with typical pointed tile roofs and frescoed walls adorned with flowers. Old bridges cross clear streams."}
{"original": "The valleys are dotted with chestnut forests, solitary chapels, abandoned lodges, dairy farms, mills and copper mines in need of a restyle. Two minuscule ghost hamlets are accessible by foot only on mule paths covered by overgrown cherry shrubs."}
{"original": "Locana offers a healthy lifestyle, great food and folklore fairs all-year round, says Mattiet."}

{"original": "Locana isn't the only town in Piedmont badly in need of a rebirth. A little farther north, on the Swiss frontier, the mayor of Borgomezzavalle is playing what he hopes will be a winning card."}
{"original": "To revitalize a population that's dwindled to barely 320 residents, Alberto Preioni is not only selling abandoned mountain cottages for just €1 -- just over $1 -- he's also paying all newcomers who are starting a family."}
{"original": "This town was created in 2016 with the fusion of two neighboring villages which were disappearing, he tells CNN Travel. We've got tons of money to invest but we need kids and youth."}
{"original": "That's why I'm offering €1,000 for each newborn and another €2,000 to anyone willing to start a business and register for VAT."}
{"original": "Local taxes are very low and Preioni also promises free public transport to all students. There's not even any need to take up residency."}
{"original": "Borgomezzavalle -- the name means the town between the valley -- is stuck inside a canyon, but there's sunlight all day thanks to a huge mirror placed on the opposite hillside that reflects the rays."}
{"original": "Brightly colored houses with thatched roofs, carved from the mountain flank, are clustered around neat cobbled piazzas with wooden benches and flower pots."}
{"original": "Narrow winding alleys lead to frescoed arcaded porches with decorated columns and lavish palazzos featuring loggias."}
{"original": "The €1 buildings on sale include crumbling wood and stone cottages, barns, stables and former farm and artisan dwellings. The only catch is that the new owners must commit to refurbishing the houses within two years."}
{"original": "I invite anyone interested to come see what a peaceful place this is, our untouched nature offers a detox and unplugged stay far from the madding crowd, says Preioni, who's also recovering abandoned agricultural lands for use by would-be farmers."}
{"original": "Borgomezzavalle lies close to Italy's border with Switzerland. Roberto Bianchetti/Comune Borgomezzavalle"}
{"original": "Borgomezzavalle and Locana are just the latest in a series of towns in Italy offering cheap, dilapidated properties to foreigners or paying them to move there (and take note, it's intended to be a permanent move, not just the offer of a cheap vacation home)."}

{"original": "It's OK in the short run, foreigners love Italy's beauty and crave for an eternal holiday in a sunny spot, he says. But in the long run, even they need upgraded infrastructures, good and nearby hospitals, efficient services, especially retirees."}
{"original": "You need a long-term plan to develop the local territory and keep people there."}
{"original": "One solution might be to populate the dying towns with the migrants who flock to Italy on boats across the Mediterranean, fleeing peril or hardship in Africa or the Middle East. Indeed some have moved into places like Riace, in the southwest Calabria region or Val Camonica in northern Lombardy."}

{"original": "I'm Mark Shields with the full GANG, Al Hunt, Robert Novak, Kate O'Beirne, and Margaret Carlson."}
{"original": "The Supreme Court in a five-to-four vote affirmed the constitutionality of race as a factor in admissions at the University of Michigan Law School."}
{"original": "The majority opinion, by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, said, quote, Effective participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in the civic life of our nation is essential if the dream of one nation, indivisible, is to be realized, end quote."}
{"original": "Dissenting, Justice Clarence Thomas said, quote, The majority upholds the law school's racial discrimination not be interpreting the people's Constitution but by responding to a faddish slogan of the cognoscenti, end quote."}
{"original": "The high court next ruled six to three against the Texas sodomy law. Speaking for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy said of the high court's past support of antisodomy laws, quote, Its continuance as precedent demeans the lives of homosexual persons, end quote."}
{"original": "The dissent by Justice Antonin Scalia said, quote, The court has taken sides in the culture war, end quote."}
{"original": "Kate O'Beirne, what message is -- or messages is the Supreme Court sending in these two decisions?"}
{"original": "KATE O'BEIRNE, CAPITAL GANG: Well, I think one overriding message is clearly for the majority in these cases on this Supreme Court. The Constitution doesn't just live, it mutates. And the reason why Justice Sandra Day O'Connor is so key to these decisions is, she judges on such an ad hoc basis. She's not guided by either clear legal principles, because she changes them over time, or by precedent."}
{"original": "It also tells us that the courts, as subject to elite opinion, as fellow elites in the culture, the public really doesn't like racial preferences. They support affirmative action, but not race preferences, although the elites do. And they, of course, upheld race preferences in the Michigan case, not affirmative action. And it also says that if something becomes controversial, like the antisodomy laws, they'll change their precedent, in just 17 years ago. They're not content to leave that to the democratic process. People have changed their minds, which is why only 13 states have such laws, and they're largely unenforced. But they want to jump into that kind of democratic wrangling with a tough issue and preempt the public's action."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: We are blessed here on THE CAPITAL GANG with two women attorneys. Kate O'Beirne, having heard, now about Margaret Carlson?"}
{"original": "MARGARET CARLSON, CAPITAL GANG: Sandra Day O'Connor said that equal protection means that you cannot have a law that applies differently to heterosexuals and homosexuals. So she does follow the Constitution in that regard."}
{"original": "And, you know, life is messy. And these two decisions are a little bit messy. But they come to the right conclusion. And Justice Kennedy, who's no flaming liberal, said that you cannot uphold a law, which was in Bowers (ph), which says that you're going to criminalize private behavior, whether or not, as Kate points out, those laws are enforced. The ones that remain aren't enforced."}
{"original": "However, in Texas, the door was kicked down and two people arrested for the very thing that this said."}
{"original": "And as for affirmative action, what was interesting is the difference in the way Justice Thomas perceives affirmative action, in his -- how it turned out for him, and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. She said, Hey, I wouldn't be a justice if it weren't for affirmative action. It inflames and angers Justice Thomas that people think he's got the job because of affirmative action, when, in fact, he wouldn't have the job if not."}
{"original": "I wish somebody'd ask him that question."}
{"original": "ROBERT NOVAK, CAPITAL GANG: I wondered how long it would take before somebody attacked Clarence Thomas, which I think is just reprehensible. I can't really improve much at all on what Kate said. I agree with everything she said."}
{"original": "Just suffice to say that they -- the court acts as a superlegislature, decides what is -- what -- rules what the law should be on homosexuality, what the law should be on affirmative action, and doesn't worry about the Constitution."}
{"original": "That's what this -- the disgrace is. And, of course, yes, if the sodomy law of Texas is going to be changed, which it should be, it should be done by the Texas legislature, not by the U.S. Supreme Court. There is nothing in the Constitution about it. In fact, on the equal protection clause, Margaret, none of the other justices agreed with Justice O'Connor, who really is a disgrace on that court."}
{"original": "I would say right now that the next justice on the court's going to be probably the White House counsel, Alberto Gonzales, and I think he'll fit right into this mold on the court. Be better than O'Connor, but who wouldn't?"}
{"original": "AL HUNT, CAPITAL GANG: Two good decisions this week, Mark. The sodomy case, it was decided on due process, Bob, which is actually broader than equal protection. Justice Scalia said that they're choosing sides in the culture war. He's chosen sides all along. He's a great gay-basher."}
{"original": "And on affirmative action, Mark, couple things. There's nothing in Sandra Day O'Connor's wise decision that mandates affirmative action. Nothing. It simply says that if a university wants to use racial preferences for diversity, it can do it."}
{"original": "And the history demonstrated it's worked, it's worked in the United States military, it's worked in the service academies, for which Ted Olson had no answer, and it's worked with the University of Michigan, one of the best law schools in the country."}
{"original": "Finally, Mark, there's this argument, if it weren't for these affirmative action on race, that higher education would be an academic meritocracy. Nonsense. There are preferences given for rich kids, preferences given for legacies, preference given for athletes."}
{"original": "But some people don't want to focus on that, they just want to focus on race."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: Margaret Carlson, just go back to what Bob Novak said. The president himself praised..."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: ... Justice O'Connor's decision as careful and balanced. And there was -- if anything, there was a resounding silence from conservatives on Capitol Hill over the sodomy decision. I mean, what does this mean politically? Does this mean that they've taken a leave on these important issues to the conservative base?"}
{"original": "CARLSON: Well, as Justice Scalia said, he's taken sides in the culture wars, and President Bush has taken the side of affirmative action is a good thing for a compassionate conservative to embrace, as is giving gays, tolerating gays in our society."}
{"original": "O'BEIRNE: Let the record show, the military, the American military, does not use race preferences, because it's not the same as affirmative action. And when the publics have a chance, even in liberal states like California and the state of Washington, to vote down race preferences, they do so."}
{"original": "There's very little evidence that they lead to the kind of (UNINTELLIGIBLE) understanding that Justice O'Connor talks about at Michigan, where they have segregated dorms and black-only graduations. And of course it's only one kind of diversity they talk about. When 91 percent of Ivy League law professors voted for Al Gore and Ralph Nader, I'd say they have a far bigger diversity problem on American elite campuses than whether or not..."}
{"original": "O'BEIRNE: ... you have a requisite number of black kids in the class."}
{"original": "NOVAK: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) the president -- you mentioned President Bush. President Bush joined the prevailing opinion on the court with mostly Republican appointed justices on the court. And in fact, his toning down of Solicitor General Ted Olson's original brief on affirmative action on the orders of Alberto Gonzales and President Bush, indicated that this is the kind of decision the president wanted."}
{"original": "I just think it's the wrong decision."}
{"original": "HUNT: Let the record also show that the United States service academies, Annapolis, West Point, and the Air Force Academy, practice exactly the same kind of affirmative action the University of Michigan Law School does. They do it through the prep schools. There's no difference."}
{"original": "And the United States military not only practices it, Colin Powell, the most visible beneficiary, says he was a absolute product of affirmative action. When they sent a bunch of promotions in 1978 and Clifford Adams (UNINTELLIGIBLE) sent them back and said, You can do better, and we got Colin Powell."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: Let me just say that I thought the most compelling brief that was filed was filed on behalf of the military. (UNINTELLIGIBLE) signed by Norman Schwarzkopf and Dennis Blair (UNINTELLIGIBLE) chief of naval of operations. I mean, making the case that the United States military is a remarkable institution where there is no discrimination, and at the same time, there is no special treatment, and..."}
{"original": "O'BEIRNE: Exactly, which is not what race preferences are."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: ... (UNINTELLIGIBLE) -- no, but, I mean, but the reality is..."}
{"original": "O'BEIRNE: The military is a meritocracy."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: ... the reality -- the reality -- there is a meritocracy, but the reality is, you have to have people on that route and on that trail to have a chance..."}
{"original": "O'BEIRNE: ... the prep schools, which is fine..."}
{"original": "O'BEIRNE: The service academies cannot have the same kind of acceptance scheme that the University of Michigan Law School has, because it's a holistic scheme that nobody..."}
{"original": "HUNT: Well, that's funny, Kate, because they say they do."}
{"original": "HUNT: They filed a brief and said they did."}
{"original": "HUNT: I don't think the service..."}
{"original": "HUNT: ... I don't think the service academy..."}
{"original": "O'BEIRNE: ... (UNINTELLIGIBLE) now they have..."}
{"original": "HUNT: ... I don't think the..."}
{"original": "HUNT: I don't think the service academies would lie."}
{"original": "GANG of five will be back with whether government help for buying prescription drugs is finally at hand for seniors. As a senior, I'm asking."}
{"original": "Separate prescription drug Medicare bills passed the House and the Senate. The Senate consensus nearly broke down when Republicans included a means testing provision."}
{"original": "SEN. TED KENNEDY (D), MASSACHUSETTS: The kind of Medicare system that our seniors rely on day in and day out will be destroyed. (END VIDEO CLIP)"}
{"original": "SHIELDS: But the provision was eliminated. The bill passed by a vote of 76 to 21, despite conservative and liberal arguments against it."}
{"original": "SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), ARIZONA: For anyone who believes this bill will cost a maximum of $400 billion over the next 10 years, I've got some ocean front property in Gila Bend, Arizona, to sell you."}
{"original": "SEN. BOB GRAHAM (D), FLORIDA: Many of those who most need prescription drug coverage today simply will not live long enough to get any benefits under this plan."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: The House bill passed by just a one-vote margin after a bitter partisan debate."}
{"original": "REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER: The Democrats have come to this floor as servants of the people. The Republicans have come to this floor as handmaidens of the prescription drug industry."}
{"original": "REP. TOM DELAY (R-TX), MAJORITY LEADER: Medicare is too important for partisan politics."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: Reluctant Republican support to pass the bill was rounded up by the speaker."}
{"original": "REP. DENNIS HASTERT (R), SPEAKER: This is a defining moment for this Congress, and it's too late for obstruction, it's too late for nit-picking..."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: Bob Novak, how will these two competing bills be put together in final form?"}
{"original": "NOVAK: Not very easily. This may be one of the most fascinating conferences ever. The conservatives have been fobbed in the Senate, saying, We're going to fix it in conference. But if they fix it in conference and make it closer to the House bill, which is a bad bill too, in my opinion, then they're going to stand a chance of losing the Democratic votes there."}
{"original": "So it's a very delicate process."}
{"original": "The important thing is that the Republicans, with the blessing and fast push by the White House, have embarked on a new entitlement. It is distasteful to the most effective conservatives in both houses, who voted no. Not many voted no, but they were the best people. And it is a very sorry day, I think, for the conservative cause."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: I mean, that's very helpful, Al, we know who the best people are."}
{"original": "HUNT: I'm stunned that Tom DeLay is not one of the best people, Bob. You really have done a -- you've done a 180. You're right, though, about the House bill being a bad bill. And I think it's..."}
{"original": "HUNT: ... I think it doesn't go nearly far enough. I think the Senate bill is imperfect, but you can at least improve upon it. But the House bill, the House showed that the principal conservatives are paper tigers. Now, only 18 conservatives voted against this expansion of government."}
{"original": "Mark, I think that this is going to be a tough conference, but I think that both sides are petrified for it not to happen. The one thing I hope the Democrats in the Senate will do is, put Edward Kennedy on that conference, because I think Edward Kennedy has a veto power over whatever they finally approve."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: Kate O'Beirne, I have a question. George Bush won a smashing victory last November, and the Republican agenda since he came back was essentially extension of unemployment benefits, creation of homeland security, and prescription drugs."}
{"original": "NOVAK: What happened to the tax cuts?"}
{"original": "SHIELDS: That's not -- But that -- but, I mean, beyond that, beyond the tax cut. But that -- those were the three things that he said he wanted in the second term -- in the second session of Congress. I'm just asking, that doesn't sound like a conservative agenda."}
{"original": "O'BEIRNE: Well, the White House will remind you that in 2000, George Bush ran on a promise to deliver a prescription drug benefit."}
{"original": "O'BEIRNE: And, of course, the challenge conservatives face in the House, who very much wanted to oppose this bill, is, if you don't vote for the bill, nobody listens to any kind of modification you want to make to it. And because this bill is an inevitability, many of them think it's worth voting for so you can change something about it."}
{"original": "Look, lots of bets are being placed. The Republican White House is betting they're going to be rewarded for delivering a benefit like this, and they're betting it will, this reform, will increase the role of the private market. Ted Kennedy's betting the private market features will fail. The Democratic candidates for president are betting the reform will be unpopular. They voted no. The only safe bet is what John McCain talked about, it's going to cost a whole lot more money than current estimates. That's the only safe bet."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: Picking up on Kate's part, Margaret, though, we're talking about -- they finessed 2004, because the bill doesn't..."}
{"original": "CARLSON: The first, the -- yes."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: So you get by the presidential election, the next election, so it won't be that kind of revolt we saw against catastrophic coverage."}
{"original": "CARLSON: Catastrophic. And there could be, because there's a -- what the call a doughnut in there, where seniors end up paying a huge amount before the catastrophic amounts kick in on this. And in the details of this bill, which, you know, even Bob might be hard-pressed to enumerate, could lie a lot of trouble for both sides, whoever wants to claim victory for this bill."}
{"original": "I mean, it's not going to be reduced easily to a sound bite. Senator Kennedy, it looks like his bill, Bush will embrace it. Those two are together. Where are the conservatives? And when seniors start to complain, if they do, over the amounts they're going to have to pay, and if they're pushed, as the House bill would do, into private plans, you might have that Rostenkowski revolt."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: Let me just ask Bob Novak this. Bob, Jeff Garron (ph), the Democratic pollster, is a very true guy, he's done a lot of polling (UNINTELLIGIBLE)..."}
{"original": "NOVAK: He's a big Democrat, so..."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: I said, Democratic, I said, Democratic pollster. He said there are two things that seniors want. They want predictability and simplicity. And that this legislation involves complexity and unpredictability, and..."}
{"original": "NOVAK: Well, that, I heard that on the Senate floor over and over again. But the most, the most, the most..."}
{"original": "CARLSON: You're boring him, Mark. NOVAK: ... the most, the most interesting..."}
{"original": "NOVAK: ... thing was that this bipartisan great huge majority, which I always distrust bipartisan bills, somebody sold out if there's a bipartisan bill, but it almost came undone on what issue? Why did Teddy Kennedy get ready for a filibuster? Because of means testing, of saying that the rich people, like Mark Shields, would have to -- would not get the same benefits as poor people."}
{"original": "Why was Teddy Kennedy opposed to that? Because he loves the rich? No, because they know that this -- if you get this on a basis of a means testing, which it should be, it cut -- it begins to look like welfare, which it is."}
{"original": "HUNT: I love to hear to hear Bob Novak..."}
{"original": "HUNT: I love to hear Bob Novak..."}
{"original": "CARLSON: ... and Mark -- and Mark..."}
{"original": "HUNT: And I want to tell you one more thing too..."}
{"original": "HUNT: ... is, if you get this baby enacted, if this gets on the table, Kate is right, it is going to be good. I think Bush will get credit in 2004."}
{"original": "HUNT: But afterwards, they'll go through the (UNINTELLIGIBLE) thing, and you can build on this, and John McCain and Kate are right."}
{"original": "HUNT: ... tax cut. CARLSON: But this is why Kennedy did that, is that Republicans have vowed at one time or another to make Medicare wither on the vine and make it for the very sick and the very poor. And if you means- test it, it's the beginning."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: I hate bipartisan bills like the Civil Rights Act of 19..."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: Next on Capital Gang, can Howard Dean be nominated for president?"}
{"original": "Former Vermont governor Howard Dean officially announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination."}
{"original": "HOWARD DEAN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I speak not only for my candidacy, I speak for a new American century and a new generation of Americans, both young people and young at heart..."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: The day before his announcement, he was asked by NBC's Tim Russert about his previous advocacy of reduced Social Security and Medicare benefits."}
{"original": "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, MEET THE PRESS, NBC)"}
{"original": "DEAN: That was the middle of har -- I mean, I don't recall saying that, but I'm sure I did."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: At a Democratic fund raiser later in the week, Dean joked about his own combative reputation."}
{"original": "DEAN: Let me say how delighted I am to have all my opponents here in one room, so I can apologize to each and every one of you..."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: Dean finished first this week in an online poll."}
{"original": "Margaret Carlson, is it time to take Howard Dean seriously as a possible Democratic nominee for president?"}
{"original": "CARLSON: Seriously, in that it may be Dean versus one of the others. He's second in New Hampshire, third in Iowa. He raised over $2 million largely on the Internet in one quarter."}
{"original": "He's got a few things going against him. For a straight talker, he doesn't always give a straight answer, and some of that was obvious on Tim Russert, when he said things like he -- It's good that I apologized, but he quibbled over whether had had to apologize to Bob Graham."}
{"original": "And then saying he'd have people for that sort of thing for the questions he didn't have an answer to, which worked for George Bush in 2000, but I don't think works now after 9/11, when you really want your presidents not to be frat boys but to be really serious."}
{"original": "And he does have the anti-war problem, and, you know, even the most antiwar people kind of agree that it's good thing that Saddam Hussein is gone, and he said, Oh, I suppose that's a good thing. That hurt him."}
{"original": "O'BEIRNE: I don't disagree with Margaret about his prospects. Much can happen, but I sort of like Howard Dean's chances. She's also right, his back -- his defenders and fans call him a true believer. He's more of an equivicator. I mean, he's flipping around on balanced budget amendment and Social Security and the death penalty and gay marriage."}
{"original": "So he's not much of a straight talker. And he comes across as angry and prickly. But look, the Democratic base is angry, and I think he well represents their mood, and there are a whole lot of them pessimistic about the chances of any Democrat knocking off a popular George Bush, and I think Howard Dean appeals to the death with dignity Democrats who would rather go down with a true believer, as they see it, like Howard Dean, than a Bush-lite candidate."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: You know, I hear a lot of talk in town about this Bush reelection. Bush's reelect score now is down to 50 in the polls, which is hardly the kind of thing that you'd say the guy's going to Mount Rushmore in his second term."}
{"original": "O'BEIRNE: Well, but Ronald Reagan's at this point..."}
{"original": "NOVAK: ... an approval rating over 65. (UNINTELLIGIBLE) I don't think George Bush's reelection is assured by any means."}
{"original": "HUNT: Oh, no. NOVAK: But I do, I do believe that the Howard Dean thing is just absolutely one of the most delightful developments, because the party establishment hates him, that's why they're so..."}
{"original": "NOVAK: ... they're so -- yes, they're so sensitive to his criticism. He's an outsider, he's a guy from the people's republic of Vermont. I mean, the interesting thing to me is that he may win the New Hampshire primary. And if he wins the New Hampshire primary, anything can happen."}
{"original": "HUNT: Boy, I hope this doesn't mean that Bob's deserting Al Sharpton."}
{"original": "But Robert's absolutely right, the political establishment hates him. You know, he was criticized on that Meet the Press performance, for instance, for saying that, he was asked how many active duty troops we had, he said between 1 and 2 million, we have 1.5..."}
{"original": "HUNT: ... how many do we have in Iraq, he said 135,000, it was 146. George Bush wouldn't have done anywhere that well three years ago."}
{"original": "I don't think he'll be a finalist. I think he'll be a factor. The finalist will be Kerry, Gephardt, Lieberman, two of those three. I think the most interesting political question right now is whether Dick Gephardt can get the AFL-CIO endorsement."}
{"original": "NOVAK: But he's got, he's got more, more oomph than they do, than the guys you mention, don't you agree with that?"}
{"original": "HUNT: I think with the war over..."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: You've talked too damn much tonight. Let's just -- I think Howard Dean is the most intriguing candidate thus far. He certainly has lighted the strongest bonfire and got more people involved in his candidacy. And let's be very frank about it, I mean, he was speaking for the followership and membership of the Democratic Party on their opposition to the war against Iraq, and..."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: ... it ain't looking too bad right now. I think... CARLSON: Well, you know, Democrats want an angry populist, but they don't want a nasty populist, and I think he's going to have to tone that down a little..."}
{"original": "CARLSON: ... to become the Bush fighter. They want, they want somebody going against him."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: And if Bob Novak really enjoys antiestablishment candidates that drive the party establishment, I'm surprised you didn't embrace John McCain more."}
{"original": "Coming up on the second of CAPITAL GANG..."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: ... our Newsmaker of the Week is the French ambassador in Washington, Jean-David Levitte. Beyond the Beltway looks at Iran as an emerging nuclear power with Howard -- Harvard scholar Jim Walsh. And our Outrage of the Week, that's all after the latest news headlines."}
{"original": "ANNOUNCER: Live from Washington, THE CAPITAL GANG."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: Welcome back to the second half of CAPITAL GANG."}
{"original": "I'm Mark Shields with the full GANG, Al Hunt, Robert Novak, Kate O'Beirne, and Margaret Carlson."}
{"original": "Our Newsmaker of the Week, Jean-David Levitte, French ambassador to the United States."}
{"original": "Jean-David Levitte, age 57, residence Washington, D.C., law degree and graduate, the Institute of Political Science in Paris."}
{"original": "Entered French foreign service in 1970, the staff of President Giscard d'Estaing from 1975 to 1981. Staff of President Chirac from 1995 to 2000, ambassador to the United Nations 2000 to 2002, and since then, French ambassador to the United States."}
{"original": "Al Hunt sat down with Ambassador Levitte at the French embassy in Washington earlier this week."}
{"original": "HUNT: Mr. Ambassador, U.S.-French relations deteriorated badly over the war with Iraq. Is it still at a low point?"}
{"original": "JEAN-DAVID LEVITTE, FRENCH AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES: No. I think now the situation has improved. The two presidents, President Bush and President Chirac, met in Evian during the G-8 summit. The two leaders have decided to put aside their difference over Iraq, to work together to give a boost to the Middle East process, to work together on the fight against terrorism, which is your number one priority and our number one priority, to try to solve the issues of North Korea and Iran together."}
{"original": "HUNT: Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is canceling U.S.-French military exercises. He specifically disinvited the French from a September conference of Air Force commanders. Your reaction?"}
{"original": "LEVITTE: We have a wonderful cooperation between the U.S. and French armies in the Balkans, in Afghanistan, where we have troops deployed in Kabul, and special forces with yours on the border with Pakistan. Few days ago, our troops helped 100 American citizens to get out of Liberia."}
{"original": "HUNT: Have you protested Mr. Rumsfeld's action on the September conference?"}
{"original": "LEVITTE: It is his decision. We'll respect it."}
{"original": "HUNT: Iraqi reconstruction, will France contribute money?"}
{"original": "LEVITTE: Yes, we will participate, and we have said so, with our European partners, because we need to give a chance to the Iraqi people to rebuild their country, to build democracy. We considered this war was not necessary, but the war is over."}
{"original": "HUNT: Isn't it only natural, then, that most of the big rebuilding contracts go to American firms?"}
{"original": "LEVITTE: We don't see Iraq as a pie to be shared. For us, it's a burden to be shared. It will be very costly. So it's either the American taxpayer or the world community."}
{"original": "HUNT: Mr. Ambassador, final Iraq question. Do you believe that the failure so far to find any weapons of mass destruction, especially any nuclear capability, is a vindication of the French position?"}
{"original": "LEVITTE: I would say simply, it's a vindication of the credibility of the U.N. inspections. Now we should have a second look on the credibility of the U.N. inspections. And I think it's important for other issues. Look at Iran, look at North Korea. If we could deploy U.N. inspections in these two countries, it would be a good use for you and for us."}
{"original": "HUNT: America dominates the world today, militarily, economically, and even politically. Is that inherently a good thing, or is it, in the French view, inherently destabilizing?"}
{"original": "LEVITTE: No, it is not destabilizing. No, what is important to understand is that we are in a dangerous world. So in that world, which is dangerous, it's good news to have the American military might."}
{"original": "What we want to achieve in Europe is a more coherent European capacity in terms of difference. We are too weak. We have to solve the crisis next door to the European borders. Bosnia, Kosovo, are two examples where we failed, and we had to ask you to come to help us."}
{"original": "Now, economically I would argue that we have a strong European capacity, economic force. We have the euro, and it's good news for America."}
{"original": "HUNT: On a personal note, you presented your credentials to the White House a little more than six months ago. It's been a very turbulent time. How have you been treated in Washington?"}
{"original": "LEVITTE: It seems to me it was six years ago, but at the same time, I must pay tribute to the courtesy of all my interlocutors. It's wonderful to be an ambassador in Washington. It's wonderful to travel coast to coast to explain the French position, because there is always a respectful and friendly debate. We may disagree, but we are friends."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: Al Hunt, was the ambassador being unrealistically optimistic about relations between the United States and France?"}
{"original": "HUNT: Mark, he was being very diplomatic, and he is a very effective diplomat. Tell you something interesting, I think the differences between the United States and France are far more profound than the differences between the United States and Germany."}
{"original": "In doing research for this interview, it became clear to me that George Bush actually sort of likes Chirac, and he can't stand Schroeder. Now, this is a guy who personal relations matter. I just -- I don't know what it means, but it's interesting."}
{"original": "NOVAK: I think the United States and France, when all is said and done, with all this biting -- backbiting, have too much in common to stay alienated. And you may even see French troops before too long in Iraq."}
{"original": "CARLSON: Ambassador Levitte should invite the Congress and, say, THE CAPITAL GANG over for French fries so that can be renamed from freedom fries, and all will be forgiven."}
{"original": "O'BEIRNE: I'm not sure, Bob, that France and America do have that much in common in the post-cold war world. It does strike me that the French project, regardless of what the ambassador diplomatically says, is to organize the European Union as a counterweight to America power and prestige. That puts him at odds with us."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: We wouldn't have won the Revolution without them. I'm always be grateful to the French for that."}
{"original": "Coming up, the CAPITAL GANG classic, when the Supreme Court ruled against affirmative action in 1997. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)"}
{"original": "Five and one-half years ago, the Supreme Court let stand a vote by Californians to prohibit racial preferences imposed by state policy. But the House Judiciary Committee the same week voted down a bill to end racial preferences."}
{"original": "The committee's chairman, Republican Henry Hyde of Illinois, was our guest as THE CAPITAL GANG discussed this issue on November 8, 1997."}

{"original": "SHIELDS: Bob Novak, is affirmative action in trouble, or is it making a political comeback?"}
{"original": "NOVAK: Mark, the American people hate racial preferences. It's a great issue for the Republicans, it's a terrible issue for the president. He's on the wrong place. But they're -- it -- with a -- playing a losing hand is dealt a losing hand on this. He is playing the race card."}
{"original": "REP. HENRY HYDE (R-IL), CHAIR, JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: There is general accord, agreement, among Republicans that quotas and set- asides and preferences are unconstitutional, they're wrong. But they're always saying, This isn't the time to bring it forward."}
{"original": "HUNT: Affirmative action divides this country right down the middle. California disapproved it 54-46. Houston approved it 54-46."}
{"original": "We had a poll last week, Washington Journal poll, 48-43 for. The country divides in half."}
{"original": "O'BEIRNE: The days of race preferences are numbered. The public, by 80 percent, hates them. The courts are increasingly suspicious of them. The man who's on the side of Republicans here..."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: Al Hunt, is it now obvious that these predictions, and frank predictions, of the death of racial preference were somewhat greatly exaggerated?"}
{"original": "HUNT: Yes, it is, Mark, because affirmative action works, as we can see from George Bush's endorsement of the Supreme Court decision this week."}
{"original": "NOVAK: I think those -- the statements that Kate and I made were exactly right. People still hate racial preferences. But the elite opinion drives the Supreme Court and the media."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: Margaret. CARLSON: I think it works. It worked for Justice Thomas, Justice O'Connor. I don't want to speak for Kate, but I wouldn't be on this panel without it, so I think it's a good thing."}

{"original": "SHIELDS: Joining us now from Los Angeles is Jim Walsh, executive director of Managing the Atom Project at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government."}
{"original": "Thanks for being with us, Jim."}
{"original": "JIM WALSH, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: Happy to be here, Mark."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: Jim, does its nuclear development make Iran a threat to the United States?"}
{"original": "WALSH: Well, if we're talking about nuclear weapons, certainly nuclear weapons are inherently dangerous, and so it's a serious business. But I also think we have to keep it in perspective. We have to put it in context."}
{"original": "So is it the most dangerous nuclear threat in the world today? No, I think most of my colleagues would say that Pakistan, which is crawling with terrorists, has nuclear weapons already, and has given nuclear technology to North Korea."}
{"original": "That's a bigger nuclear-related risk right now than Iran."}
{"original": "The other thing you should ask when you want to put this into context is, how do we weigh the strengths of Iran versus the U.S.? And on every measure, the U.S. is far, far stronger than Iran, 37 times as big a military force as Iran does. We have thousands of nuclear weapons, Iran has zero nuclear weapons."}
{"original": "So yes, it's serious, but we shouldn't panic, and we shouldn't provoke a crisis when there isn't need for one."}
{"original": "NOVAK: Do you think, Jim, that the very strong statements by the members of the administration -- we just had one by Dr. Rice -- are serving to provoke a crisis with the Iranian regime?"}
{"original": "WALSH: Well, I do think that they are probably unhelpful. There's been a lot of talk about destabilizing Iran, having American- made solutions to the Iranian problem. And I think that's counterproductive, because what it does, it strengthens the hand of the hard-liners, the folks we want to lose here, it actually helps them."}
{"original": "And the second thing it does is, it increases the incentive that Iran has to seek a nuclear weapon in the first place. So I think even if you want to change that regime, the last thing you want to do is going around talking about it out loud in a really loose way."}
{"original": "CARLSON: Jim, by the time the United States took action against Iraq, there were U.N. resolutions that had been violated, Iraq had invaded Kuwait, and Iran, for that matter. Iran has not been an aggressive country, although it -- now it does seem to have a nuclear program that could be converted to military use."}
{"original": "What does the United States have? Does it -- I don't believe there's a U.N. resolution calling for inspections. What framework does the United States have for putting pressure on Iran to cut back on its nuclear program?"}
{"original": "WALSH: Well, it's a good question, Margaret. You know, where is the U.S. leverage here? And it's certainly not in something like trade sanctions, because we don't do a lot of trade with Iran, and we don't recognize them as a country. It's really the nonproliferation regime where we have the most leverage."}
{"original": "Why? Because we can request inspections of undeclared facilities. We can require that the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, go police and keep an eye on Iran."}
{"original": "So I think that's a powerful tool. And I think we also want to be trying to strengthen the nonproliferation constituencies within Iran. Iran is nothing but a giant argument. These guys argue over everything. There are thousand divisions, a thousand factions, and we want to make sure the factions that oppose nuclear weapons are stronger than those that want nuclear weapons."}
{"original": "O'BEIRNE: Jim, beyond being persuaded of the value of having a nuclear capability, what lessons do you think Iran drew from the recent action in Iraq, that they can count on a divided world to stall around until they do develop a capacity? Or that America will act against world opinion if need be?"}
{"original": "WALSH: Well, it's a great question. I can't really get into the minds of the Iranians. I've met with Iranians to talk about nuclear weapons in Rome and in Vienna, but it's a hard thing to try to speculate on their motivations. It seems to me two things are possible, and we'll just have to see."}
{"original": "One is that the U.S. action in Iraq makes them feel more secure and makes them feel like they better not go down the path towards nuclear weapons, or they'll get whacked."}
{"original": "The other possibility here, and some people say this is through North Korea, is that the lesson they'll learn is, We better build our nuclear weapon as soon as possible. The mistake that Iraq made was being sort of betwixt and between. We better get our nuclear weapon to protect us."}
{"original": "I don't know which of those lessons or other lessons they may have learned. But the more we threaten them, I think the greater the incentive that they will seek nuclear weapons."}
{"original": "HUNT: Jim, the Russians have been very helpful in getting materials to the Iranian nuclear program. The Bush administration has said recently that the Russians now appreciate the danger and are being more cooperative with our interests in not getting as much material to the -- to Iran. Is that true? And will that make a difference?"}
{"original": "WALSH: Well, I think it is true. I think it will make a difference. But this has been a struggle for some years now. I think President Putin has made clear that he wants to be careful of -- about any transfers or any relationship with Iran with respect to nuclear weapons."}
{"original": "But Menadim (ph) and other bureaucratic actors may have different views. So I think it's a tough one, but I think they are serious about it."}
{"original": "Even more important, I think, is perhaps the role of the Europeans. As I said, we don't do much trade with Iran. They're sort of persona non grata. But the Europeans have a lot of investment in Iran, have a long history of Iranian relations. And the E.U. has called on Iran to adopt a more aggressive set of rules for inspection. And I think the Europeans have a big and a positive role to play here."}
{"original": "SHIELDS: Hey, Jim Walsh, thank you very much for being with us. It's been enormously helpful."}

{"original": "Thanks to Democratic Congresswoman Marcy Kaptor of Ohio, we now know that conservatives don't always mean it when they swear allegiance to the free market. How else to explain Title VIII in the House prescription drug bill, which forbid the secretary of health and human services from negotiating with the world's biggest drug companies to get a better price for prescriptions like the VA does for veterans for the nation's seniors?"}
{"original": "Marcy Kaptor is right. By using free market pressure, we could save taxpayers and seniors billions. Bob Novak."}
{"original": "NOVAK: One senator after another took the floor in praise of Strom Thurmond, dead at age 100. The oldest combat officer in the Normandy invasion, governor of South Carolina, carrying four states for president, elected to the Senate in a write-in, longest speech in Senate history, first Southern senator with a black aide, first Deep Southern Republican senator."}
{"original": "Well, wait a minute. Didn't his colleagues force Trent Lott out as majority leader because he said nice things about old Strom? Maybe somebody owes Senator Lott an apology."}
{"original": "CARLSON: Mark, for less than a rounding error in the tax cut going to millionaires, President Bush could save Americorps' 50,000 volunteers. Two hundred corporation executives ran a full-page ad in The New York Times this week urging just that."}
{"original": "In California alone, volunteers, who build low-cost housing, tear down crack dens, and clean up parks, will drop from 6,000 to 825 without new funds."}
{"original": "Once derided as welfare for yuppies, the program now has strong bipartisan support in Congress. Bush just needs to recall there's more to being president than cutting taxes."}
{"original": "O'BEIRNE: This week, The New York Times ran a boldfaced lie on its front page, literally. Its obituary marked the death of former Senator Thurmond, who changed his position on race issues decades ago, by falsely labeling him a foe of integration. This politician's support for racial equality was far more consequential than his behavior in the distant past."}
{"original": "Such is the treatment of Republicans on race issues. You don't imagine that Senator Robert Byrd's obituary would be titled, Death of a Klansman, do you?"}
{"original": "HUNT: Mark, Governor Thurmond's 1948 presidential run as an arch-segregationist was shameful. However, unlike some of his peers, Strom in his 30 -- in his last 30 years adapted to a changing and a much better America on race."}
{"original": "On a personal note, his much younger wife and my wife were sorority sisters, and he once counseled me that we ought to have a boy, followed by a girl, then a boy, and finally a girl, the way he did."}

{"original": "Billionaires, who now number a record 2,208, have more wealth than ever before, according to an Oxfam International report published Monday. Since the global financial crisis a decade ago, the number of billionaires has nearly doubled."}
{"original": "The annual study was released ahead of the yearly World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which brings together some of the wealthiest and most influential people on Earth. The 106-page report is meant to call attention to the growing gap between rich and poor."}
{"original": "The combined fortunes of the world's 26 richest individuals reached $1.4 trillion last year — the same amount as the total wealth of the 3.8 billion poorest people."}
{"original": "Most of these mega-wealthy are American, according to the Forbes list of billionaires used by Oxfam. The names include Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Microsoft's Bill Gates, Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, who collectively are worth $357 billion, according to Forbes."}
{"original": "Oxfam recommends that nations tax wealth at fairer levels, raise rates on personal income and corporate taxes and eliminate tax avoidance by companies and the super-rich. It also advocates providing universal free health care, education and other public services — and ensuring that women and girls also benefit. And it suggests investing in public services — including water, electricity and childcare — to free up women's time and limit the number of unpaid hours they work."}
{"original": "The report echoes policy positions embraced by the newly empowered Democrats in the United States, who are advocating for similar reforms."}

{"original": "In many countries, a decent education or quality healthcare has become a luxury only the rich can afford, Oxfam said. Every day, 10,000 people die because they lack access to affordable healthcare."}
{"original": "The impact is disproportionately felt by women."}
{"original": "Girls are pulled out of school first when the money isn't available to pay fees, and women clock up hours of unpaid work looking after sick relatives when healthcare systems fail, the organization said, estimating that if all the unpaid care work carried out by women across the globe was done by a single company, it would have an annual turnover of $10 trillion."}
{"original": "The problem is felt acutely in places like India, the world's fastest growing major economy. The country has one of the world's lowest female labor participation rates.

{"original": "By now, everyone has learned that New York city and state have persuaded the corporate leviathan Amazon to build its next headquarters in Queens. They did this by offering the company $3 billion in tax incentives and state grants. But New York was not the only city to bid for Amazon's next office. Elected officials in at least 20 cities – from Los Angeles to Boston – were tripping over themselves to offer Amazon their own sweetheart packages."}

{"original": "Such special treatment is not given to everyone. Local business owners, like me, find ourselves increasingly subject to fees and permitting expenses – such as the byzantine corporate franchise taxes – imposed by the same officials wooing Amazon with a favorable deal."}
{"original": "A particularly galling example of this disconnect? As some New York city and state politicians courted Jeff Bezos, others were deciding it would be OK to add to my expenses by requiring my Manhattan bookstore – the third-generation-owned, 91-year-old Strand – to be designated as a landmark building."}
{"original": "This alleged honorific would present me with a regulatory nightmare: When any building is designated a landmark, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission henceforth must approve all building changes – from window repair and signage adjustment to the type of mortar used to repair a crack in the walls. The labyrinthine process for such approval places a burden that would cost us time and money – as it does every other small business that is so designated. Maintaining the building would require hiring landmarking experts, architects and lawyers. This additional cost, on top of our already thin margins, could very well grind the Strand into bankruptcy."}
{"original": "After spending the majority of his life working at the Strand and saving his money for more than 60 years, my father, Fred Bass, purchased the building housing the Strand in 1996 to ensure the survival of his business. Ironically, his investment could be the undoing of his life's work."}
{"original": "Though there is one more hearing at which we can argue our case against landmark status, the odds are unlikely to favor us. The city has made clear its intention to force through the designation."}
{"original": "And now, as one group of New York City bureaucrats lands Amazon's next headquarters, another group of them fails to see the significance of protecting a working bookstore with 238 employees."}
{"original": "The Amazon deal is not directly related to the city's landmark commission proposal for the Strand – but the situation certainly throws the irony of cities' kowtowing to Big Tech while they allow other businesses to suffer into sharp relief. And it's happening everywhere."}
{"original": "Take Reno, Nevada. Tesla received a $1.4 billion tax incentive to build a battery factory outside Reno.

{"original": "Another high-profile handout is Foxconn, the huge Taiwanese manufacturer, which picked up more than $4 billion from Wisconsin taxpayers, courtesy of Wisconsin politicians, to build a plant in the southeastern corner of the state. Environmental regulations, a significant expense for any of Foxconn's local competitors, have been waived for the firm's development. And a portion of the 13,000 blue-collar jobs promised will now go to Taiwanese workers instead."}
{"original": "The fact is unless we stop them, local and state politicians will continue to advantage Big Tech over longstanding local businesses. And without the powerful team of lawyers necessary to take on City Hall, small businesses will continue to suffer."}
{"original": "This dismal reality demands immediate action, as local businesses serve a critical role in our cities. They are meeting places, cultural destinations and even town halls. If they cease to exist, we lose the character of our communities and the sweat equity of our neighbors. We forfeit the American promise of hard work and self-reliance."}
{"original": "There are alternative spending options for our local officials besides cash for jobs. Rather than importing Big Tech, identify strengths and weaknesses of local industry sectors and present financial support in terms of training and technology development to build on what current taxpayers have already started. Local money then stays local."}

{"original": "You don't want to leave your family without any resources to deal with the financial implications of your death, so it's important to invest in life insurance. After all, life insurance can kick in to replace your income for years or even decades after you're gone, and the death benefit from your policy can be used to cover your final expenses and debts your family has accrued."}
{"original": "Traditional term life insurance is the most popular type of coverage, but some consumers need more than a policy that only lasts for 10 to 30 years. An alternative is to buy whole life insurance that lasts for — you guessed it — your whole life."}
{"original": "Whether whole life insurance is best for you depends on your needs and goals, so keep reading to learn more about whole life insurance, how this type of coverage works and who it's best for."}
{"original": "How does whole life insurance work?"}
{"original": "Whole life insurance is a type of permanent life insurance that's meant to last until the day you die, regardless of age. According to the Insurance Information Institute, whole life is the most common type of permanent life insurance purchased — other types of permanent coverage include variable life insurance and universal life."}
{"original": "With most whole life insurance policies, consumers pay the same premium for the duration of their policy. Meanwhile, the death benefit typically also stays the same, regardless of how long you live. Obviously, this means that while whole life insurance premiums don't become more expensive as you age, the overall total cost of your whole life policy gets larger and larger as you get older and have to continue submitting another premium payment each month."}
{"original": "But your family will receive the death benefit of your policy no matter how long you live, unlike term life insurance that only lasts for a set period of time. And whole life insurance policies also build cash value, and that cash value increases over time as you pay your premiums."}
{"original": "Learn more about whole life insurance with QuoteWizard by LendingTree."}
{"original": "How much does whole life insurance cost?"}
{"original": "PHOTO: iStock Whole life insurance can cost as much as 10 times more than similar term life insurance coverage."}
{"original": "If you want life insurance that lasts your entire life and also builds cash value, you can expect to pay a lot more for coverage than you would for a more restrictive policy. In fact, a whole life policy could easily have premiums that are 10 times higher than you would pay for the same amount of term life insurance coverage."}
{"original": "How much will whole life insurance set you back? While rates vary among insurers, based on a recent search at Top Whole Life, a 30-year-old woman in excellent health could qualify for $250,000 in whole life insurance for about $189 per month. Meanwhile, prices surge to over $373 per month for twice the coverage."}
{"original": "Compare those prices to term life insurance, which is much less expensive overall. With an online provider like Haven Life, the same woman could buy a 20-year term policy worth $250,000 for as little as $15.02 per month, or a $500,000 policy with the same term for as little as $19.46 per month."}

{"original": "The benefits of whole life insurance"}
{"original": "With whole life insurance costing significantly more than term life insurance, why do people buy it? Well, there are many advantages that come with buying whole life insurance, starting with the fact that the death benefit is guaranteed as long as you pay your premiums."}
{"original": "If you worry that your loved ones will struggle financially or not have enough money for your final expenses when you die, then having a guaranteed death benefit for your entire life is a huge advantage that may be worth the added cost."}
{"original": "Also, while your premiums may seem expensive when you're young and in good health, they could be relatively affordable in relation to your death benefit once you reach an advanced age. That's another big advantage of whole life — your premiums will always remain the same, even as your age increases and your health declines."}
{"original": "And don't forget that whole life comes with a savings component that builds cash value. The cash value of your policy grows each month that you pay for whole life insurance, since a part of your premium is set aside. In most cases, this amount becomes accessible for you to use for any reason."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, some whole life companies also pay dividends. Any dividends you receive can add to the cash value of your policy. Depending on the insurer, you may even be able to use your dividends to pay for part or all of your insurance premiums."}
{"original": "Finally, whole life insurance comes with tax benefits, including the fact that your beneficiaries will likely receive your death benefit without having to pay income tax on it. If you're a high-net-worth individual who wants to pass on tax-free money to your heirs, a whole life insurance policy can help you do that."}
{"original": "Check your life insurance rates from multiple insurers now using QuoteWizard by LendingTree."}
{"original": "Can I cash out or borrow from my whole life insurance policy?"}
{"original": "Generally speaking, the cash value growth you build in your policy can be accessed tax-free while you're alive. Many customers also borrow against the cash value of their whole life insurance policies, which they can do without paying income taxes. However, the rules regarding how and when you access the cash value in your policy can vary, so you'll need to check the details with your insurer."}
{"original": "Also, you're never stuck with a whole life insurance policy. You can surrender your policy at any time, stop paying your premiums and in most cases take out the cash value that's accrued. However, you'll likely owe income tax on any amounts you receive this way, so make sure to speak with your whole life agent or a tax adviser before you take this step."}
{"original": "Should you buy whole life insurance?"}
{"original": "PHOTO: iStock You'll pay a lot more for whole life insurance, but depending on your situation, the peace of mind could be worth the cost."}
{"original": "As you get ready to choose a whole life insurance policy, make sure you invest the time and effort required to shop around. Compare whole life premiums with at least three different life insurance companies, and find out what it would cost for a similar amount of term life insurance coverage as well."}
{"original": "At the end of the day, whole life insurance is more likely to be utilized by higher-net-worth individuals since the premiums are so much more expensive, but it can be an asset for anyone who wants to make sure money is left behind for their heirs. So while you'll pay more for permanent life insurance, the peace of mind can be worth the cost."}

{"original": "'Those at the top are not doing their part:' WH looks to raise taxes on wealthy"}
{"original": "So much ink has been spilled for so long on the national debt, it might be nice if that $22 trillion plus on the red side of the US balance sheet just didn't really matter."}
{"original": "That's exactly the thinking behind a new school of economic theory that the government should be spending more, not less."}
{"original": "The status quo is that Republicans promised strong growth kickstarted by the tax cuts they passed without Democratic help would help pay for the tax cuts themselves. That's a question mark in any case, but it will only really work with so-called entitlement reform to curb the growth in spending of Medicare and Social Security. They passed the tax cuts – the easy part – without addressing the spending, the hard part."}
{"original": "The end result is that the US deficit – the amount of money the US government takes in from taxes and other things subtracted from the amount it spends – is projected to be more than a trillion dollars this year."}
{"original": "In total, it'll be $22 trillion any day now and it's going to get a lot bigger. Cue the annual-ish political fight over raising the US debt limit – the top amount the government is allowed under law to borrow."}
{"original": "By the way, lawmakers don't even raise the debt limit any more. Recently, they've just suspended the idea of a debt limit for a year. Democrats indicated this year they want to create an automatic mechanism to raise the debt ceiling, but Republicans aren't sold on the idea."}
{"original": "Growing debt has caused more than its share of distress among politicians who warn about the dangers of the US essentially being in hock to its creditors."}
{"original": "But no amount of warning has stopped each successive recent president from finding a way to add their own spending projects, but never enough belt-tightening to offset new spending. The last time the US didn't spend more than it took in was in 2001."}
{"original": "George W. Bush spent big on the war on terrorism and also his prescription drug addition to Medicare. Barack Obama spent big on stimulus during the Great Recession and on Obamacare. And Donald Trump spent on his tax cuts."}
{"original": "When Democrats took power in Congress, a new wave of of lawmakers wanted to scrap nonbinding so-called paygo – pay as you go – rules so that they could introduce and vote for new government programs to give free education and better health care and deal with climate change without having to pay for them by either raising taxes or cutting spending elsewhere in the budget."}
{"original": "Democratic elders prevailed, for now, on that front, but it's clear that more progressive Democrats who helped land their party the majority and who are more in line with the Bernie Sanders wing of the party than the Hillary Clinton one have big plans for the government to help people and no desire to balance the budget."}
{"original": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the poster child for the new Democrats, has spoken freely about her desire to impose a marginal tax rate upward of 70% on the wealthiest Americans. That sounds politically crazy after Republicans just lowered taxes on the wealthiest Americans. But it's not exactly unprecedented – similar rates were in place under Republican and Democratic administrations in the '50s and '60s. Nor is it out of step with what a lot of economists have been saying, according to an approving column by New York Times columnist Paul Krugman."}
{"original": "Ocasio-Cortez and other progressives like Sanders aren't afraid to talk about spending trillions on new programs without cutting other programs, debt be damned."}
{"original": "You can pay for it by saving costs on expenditures that we're already doing, Ocasio-Cortez recently told Business Insider. We can do it by saving money on military spending. We can pay for it by raising taxes on the very rich. We can pay for it with a transaction tax. We can pay for it with deficit spending."}
{"original": "The school of thought that allows such dreams – Modern Monetary Theory – suggests seriously that if a government that controls a currency needs more money, it just prints more. It can't go bankrupt if it's printing its own money. Just print more, essentially."}
{"original": "The idea is that the deficit actually equals wealth in the private sector and that's a good thing. What are the treasuries securing that debt if not the promise of newly printed money? And as long as there's a market for them, they should be used by the government to improve society."}
{"original": "If that sounds a bit socialist, it is, but so are the self-described democratic socialists like Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez."}
{"original": "The liberal Krugman, for the record, while approving of the higher taxes, has been less friendly to MMT, as its known."}
{"original": "While it may literally be true that a government with its own currency can't go bankrupt, it can destroy that currency if it loses fiscal credibility, he wrote back in 2011."}
{"original": "But people like Stephanie Kelton, Sanders' economist in 2016, a professor at Stony Brook University, and a proselytizer for this view toward currencies and national economies, argues that the government essentially prints money each time it authorizes new unpaid for programs and that it hasn't hurt the economy by causing runaway inflation."}
{"original": "We asked her for her her thoughts on the national debt as it approaches $22 trillion. That exchange is below:"}
{"original": "CNN: We've spent years and years in US politics worrying about the national debt, which is going to hit $22 trillion any day. $22 trillion sounds like so much money and the rate at which the debt has been increasing seems to be speeding up. Why is this not such a big deal?"}
{"original": "Kelton: Few people understand what the national debt is, and most people tend to conflate government deficits with the national debt. So let's start by clarifying these terms. The national debt is nothing more than a historical record of all the dollars that were spent by government but not taxed back. When the government spends more than it collects in the form of taxes (and other payments), we label it deficit spending. But that's only part of the story. To complete the picture, suppose the government spends $100 into the economy but only taxes $90 back out. The result is a surplus equal to $10 that shows up somewhere in the non-government part of the economy. In other words, the government's red ink becomes our black ink. Their deficits are our financial surpluses. So where does the debt come into play? Whenever the government runs a deficit, it sells government bonds called U.S. Treasuries. This is usually referred to as borrowing, but that's actually misleading. What's really happening is that the government is allowing people to trade in their dollars for a bond that pays some interest. A pretty good deal if you happen to be lucky enough to hold some of that $22 trillion."}
{"original": "CNN: What size annual deficit would worry you and why?"}
{"original": "Kelton: Inflation is the relevant risk, not the size of the annual deficit. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, budget deficits rose to more than 10 percent of GDP. They were big, by historic standards, but they were nothing to worry about. In fact, most economists seem to agree that bigger (and better targeted) deficits would have helped the economy recover much more quickly. Today, the government is running annual budget deficits that are expected to reach $1 trillion. That's a lot of zeros, but so what? Remember, their red ink is our black ink. What worries me about the deficits we're running today is not their size but their nature. A big part of the reason the government is running bigger deficits right now is because Republicans voted for tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the richest Americans and large corporations. Income and wealth inequality—already at alarming levels—will only widen. So I worry about the way these deficits are being used to funnel resources to the people who least need the help."}
{"original": "CNN: If Republicans can slash tax rates and Democrats should pass massive benefits programs like Medicare for All and free college without regard to debt, what's the brake? What keeps politicians in check with what they can promise to voters. Or should there be a brake?"}
{"original": "Kelton: The brake is inflation. If policymakers run wild, cutting taxes and pumping money into the economy with reckless abandon, inflation will spike and voters will (presumably) check those politicians at the ballot box. So, in a sense, democracy is the thing that keeps politicians in check. But that doesn't mean we can't pass Medicare-for-All or make public colleges and universities tuition-free, even with the tax cuts in place. The debt is not the constraining factor (except, perhaps, politically). The point is this: the economic constraint is inflation."}
{"original": "CNN: Part of what you argue is that if inflation gets out of hand, that's a good time for Congress to raise taxes. But the political momentum is in the opposite direction, as we saw last year with the tax cuts. What's your thinking on where political reality runs into economic theory?"}
{"original": "Kelton: I believe the government should use the federal budgeting process to maintain a balanced economy. That means balancing the risks of inflation against the benefits of full employment. It means embarking on new spending programs only if those programs can be implemented without causing excessive inflation. It might be necessary to raise taxes in order to prevent, say, a massive infrastructure program from pushing the economy beyond its limit. But taxes aren't the only way to curb inflation. The most important thing is to understand what's actually driving the inflation. Historically, the big drivers of inflation have been: energy, housing, and health care. So even if the political reality means you can't raise taxes, you can still fight inflation with policies that increase the supply of available housing units, promote energy efficiency, and lower health care costs. I also wouldn't discount the possibility that our political realities might evolve rather quickly with an MMT-informed Congress."}
{"original": "CNN: Is MMT a socialist idea or is it a free market idea? Explain."}
{"original": "Kelton: Neither. MMT is mostly a descriptive project. It provides a lens that can be used to understand how a modern, capitalist economy works. Based on that understanding, MMT also offers a prescriptive side, which shows how fiscal/monetary/regulatory policies can be used to constrain inflation while maintaining full employment."}
{"original": "CNN: If the national debt shouldn't scare Americans, what should?"}
{"original": "Kelton: The national debt is nothing to fear. What should scare Americans is allowing misunderstandings and fear-mongering about the national debt to prevent us from taking bold action to deal with the urgent threat of climate change."}
{"original": "The big test for the stock market's Trump rally may be President Trump himself."}
{"original": "Wall Street's post-election surge was built on hopes of a pro-growth agenda getting swiftly implemented. Investors bet big that Trump's promises to slash taxes, unleash infrastructure spending and cut regulation would accelerate the sluggish American economy."}
{"original": "But those hopes are already getting undercut by Trump's turbulent first days in office."}
{"original": "Instead of focusing on pushing his stimulus plans through Congress, as investors had hoped, Trump is instead acting first on polarizing issues like the ban on travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations. The White House has also taken an aggressive stance on trade, raising concerns on Wall Street over the risk of a trade war."}

{"original": "President Donald Trump and former President Jimmy Carter are the only presidents to oversee government shutdowns while their party controlled both chambers of Congress."}
{"original": "They are also the only two presidents to oversee three shutdowns in the same year. The federal government experienced three funding lapses under Jimmy Carter in 1977 when both chambers of Congress were Democratic. The current federal shutdown is the third one this year, although the previous two were much shorter."}
{"original": "The money that Congress and Trump are fighting over – $5 billion for the border wall – is a small fraction of the overall federal budget. The total federal budget is $4.4 trillion, but 70% of that is mandatory spending. The other 30% is discretionary spending that lawmakers appropriate each year. This is where funding for federal agencies comes in."}
{"original": "This year, discretionary spending for federal agencies was not passed in one single 'omnibus' spending package like it has been in the recent past. Some agencies, like the Defense Department, had their funding bills passed before the end of 2018. Each agency has a separate appropriations process. 2018 was the first year in more than a decade that some of the congressional appropriations bills were passed on time. That's why only certain agencies are shut down."}
{"original": "Approximately 380,000 federal employees are furloughed, meaning they cannot go to work and are not being paid, according to Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee. Four hundred and twenty thousand federal employees are working in what the government deems essential positions and are required to continue working without pay."}
{"original": "Tens of thousands of employees working for federal contractors are impacted by the shutdown as well, according to Professional Services Council Executive Vice President and Counsel Alan Chvotkin. PSC is an advocacy organization that represents government technology and professional services federal contractors."}
{"original": "In past shutdowns, Congress has passed legislation to pay back federal employees for the time they were not paid during the shutdown. People working for federal contractors, however, may not receive the same back pay that full time federal employees do."}
{"original": "It is nearly impossible to nail down a specific number of how many federal contract employees are impacted by this shutdown. The impacts of the shutdown vary by department and agency, and there is no central database of stop work orders from agencies to contractors or how many affected contractors are impacted by those orders. The impact of the shutdown also changes as the shutdown continues because some work that could continue originally with other funds may no longer be able to do so, according to a PSC spokesperson."}
{"original": "Agencies and departments impacted by the shutdown include some of the key federal government services, like law enforcement, travel screening and business services, although many of those workers, like FBI special agents and TSA screeners, will continue to work without pay for the moment."}
{"original": "The agencies involved in the shutdown include the Departments of Justice, Treasury, Commerce, Agriculture, Homeland Security, Interior, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. Part of the State Department are also closed. Other key federal institutions like the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, the Smithsonian museums, including the National Zoo in Washington, DC, are also affected."}
{"original": "Many of the closed agencies provide key law enforcement functions. Homeland Security houses the Transportation Security Administration, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection. The Justice Department houses the FBI and a significant portion of both of these departments are essential employees working without pay."}
{"original": "But federally-run museums and national parks have been shut down."}
{"original": "And IRS workers have also been furloughed. They were already scrambling to deal with the new tax law. Tax day has been delayed after at least one previous government shutdown, but it's not clear if that will happen now. It's also not clear when this partial shutdown will end."}
{"original": "CNN's Nikki Carvajal, Aaron Pellish and JoElla Carman contributed to this report."}
{"original": "New York (CNN Business) America's energy policy is getting an extreme makeover."}
{"original": "On his first day in the White House, Biden took a series of executive actions that put an exclamation point on his commitment to address climate change. Biden immediately moved to rejoin the Paris Agreement on climate change, revoke a permit that former President Donald Trump granted to the controversial Keystone XL pipeline and place a temporary moratorium on oil and gas leasing in the Arctic."}
{"original": "The steps underscore just how sharply US climate policy is changing, not only from the Trump era but even from the approach of the Obama administration in which Biden played a major role."}
{"original": "The era of supporting fossil fuels, even as a temporary bridge to a clean future, is over, said Bob McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group. The United States has shifted from all-of-the-above to accelerated decarbonization."}
{"original": "Even during the Obama administration, the United States supported natural gas as a cleaner alternative to coal. But gas is now falling out of favor in Washington, too."}
{"original": "Climate activists celebrated Biden's Day One moves -- and promised to press for much more."}
{"original": "This is swift and decisive action. It makes the United States once more part of the global climate solution -- not the problem, Mitchell Bernard, president of the National Resources Defense Council, said in a statement Wednesday."}
{"original": "Many scientists fear the United States, and the world, lost valuable time during the Trump era in combating the worsening climate crisis."}
{"original": "May Boeve, executive director of environmental group 350.org, vowed to ensure Biden stops all harmful fossil fuel infrastructure, including the Dakota Access Pipeline and other projects."}
{"original": "Tom Werner, CEO of solar technology and energy storage company SunPower, applauded Biden's executive actions and expressed hope for additional steps, including support for minority-owned clean energy businesses and streamlining project permitting."}
{"original": "It's inspiring to have leaders in office who squarely put clean energy and the environment as one of the most urgent and top priorities, Werner told CNN Business in an email."}
{"original": "At least one Big Oil CEO cheered as well."}
{"original": "I applaud President Biden's decision to rejoin the Paris Agreement. It's a deal made stronger with the United States as a member, and we look forward to working with the administration to meet the goals outlined within it, Gretchen Watkins, president of the Shell Oil Company, said in a statement."}
{"original": "However, some Republicans and oil industry executives immediately bashed Biden's moves."}
{"original": "Killing the Keystone XL pipeline and rejoining the Paris Agreement will eliminate good-paying jobs, US Senator Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia, said in a statement. She said it is imperative that Congress aggressively exercises oversight and pushes back on the worst impulses of Washington bureaucrats."}
{"original": "Mike Sommers, the CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, said in a statement the oil-and-gas lobby supports the ambitions of the Paris Agreement. Sommers also emphasized that the world needs natural gas, including expanded liquefied natural gas (LNG), to make the transition to cleaner fuels."}
{"original": "However, Sommers slammed Biden's decision to revoke the Keystone XL pipeline permit as a misguided move and a slap in the face to union workers supporting the project. Sommers called it a significant step backwards both for environmental progress and our economic recovery."}
{"original": "Keystone XL has been a political football between climate activists and the oil industry. The planned pipeline would carry oil from the tar sands of Canada into the United States."}
{"original": "TC Energy TRP , the Canadian company building the pipeline, called the Biden decision very disappointing and said it will cause the project to be suspended."}
{"original": "Andrew Grant, head of climate, energy and industry research at Carbon Tracker, said the decision to stop Keystone XL makes sense based purely on economics."}
{"original": "It's high-cost and high-carbon. If we're serious about hitting the Paris climate goals, this is exactly the kind of oil [project] that shouldn't be going ahead, Grant said."}
{"original": "Energy analysts said the consequences of the Keystone XL decision are far larger for Canada than for US consumers."}
{"original": "We're awash in oil right now. We have a glut, said McNally, the Rapidan Energy consultant. We don't desperately need that oil."}
{"original": "Still, the move marks a shift from Trump's efforts to advance oil pipelines and support the industry broadly."}
{"original": "Last spring, with oil prices crashing and the shale industry on the brink, Trump pressured Russia and Saudi Arabia to end their oil price dispute. OPEC and its allies eventually agreed to unprecedented production cuts that stopped the bleeding."}
{"original": "Donald Trump came in and helped save shale's bacon by intervening, said McNally."}
{"original": "Trump also knew he couldn't afford to lose political support in major energy-producing states such as Texas."}
{"original": "Similarly, Biden will face a difficult challenge in balancing the need to address the climate crisis without worsening the jobs crisis facing the United States."}
{"original": "The Biden coalition is a very tenuous alliance between progressive environmentalists and organized labor, Josh Price, senior analyst at Height Capital Markets, said in an email."}
{"original": "The Biden plan calls for pouring trillions of dollars into clean energy, creating millions of union jobs while slashing carbon emissions."}
{"original": "However, Biden's legislative climate is in jeopardy because Democrats only have a slim majority in both houses of Congress. Moderate Democrats, including West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, are unlikely to back sweeping climate action such as the Green New Deal or steps to strip the oil industry of tax breaks."}
{"original": "The Biden team and environmental advocates in Congress will need to take stock of their assets and go back to the drawing board for a feasible plan, Price said."}
{"original": "Anyone looking for clues as to what President Trump might include in his much-promised revamp of his tax reform proposal may have gotten a clue over the weekend."}
{"original": "In an interview with Jesse Watters of Fox News, Trump reiterated his oft-stated desire to cut taxes for everyone -- both businesses and individuals. He also noted that the number of tax brackets would be reduced from seven to three or four."}
{"original": "That might signal a change from his latest proposal in which he called for just three brackets -- a 12% bracket, a 25% bracket and a 33% bracket -- just as the House Republican's tax reform blueprint does."}
{"original": "Related: How Paul Ryan and Donald Trump differ on tax reform"}
{"original": "Trump then went on to say, I'd like to see 0[%] if you don't make much, like 0. That's what it's going to be, it's going to be 0 up to a level."}
{"original": "In other words, the first $X you earn would be taxed at 0%. And that 0% is possibly the fourth bracket to which Trump alluded."}
{"original": "But here's the thing: Under today's code, the standard deduction effectively serves as a 0% rate, said Len Burman, a former deputy assistant secretary for tax analysis at Treasury."}
{"original": "That is, your adjusted gross income is automatically reduced by $6,300 if you're single, or by $12,600 if you're married filing jointly. So it removes that amount from your federal taxable income."}
{"original": "Both Trump and the House GOP blueprint have already proposed greatly increasing the standard deduction. House Republicans would nearly double it while Trump would go farther -- raising it to $15,000 for singles and $30,000 for married couples."}
{"original": "Having both (a 0% bracket and a standard deduction) wouldn't make much sense, said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center."}
{"original": "So perhaps the president was suggesting that the newest iteration of his tax reform proposal would offer a 0% bracket in place of a bigger standard deduction. Or maybe he was merely emphasizing the effect a larger standard deduction would have for those who don't earn much. Or maybe he was just hinting that his next plan will do a better job of not increasing taxes for some low- and moderate income parents, who might be hurt by various other changes he called for, such as a repeal of certain exemptions and the head of household status."}
{"original": "Trump also suggested that in his next tax proposal the first rate above 0% might be different than in his latest version. But he wasn't specific on what the final numbers would be."}
{"original": "Then it's going to be 12.5%, 15%, it's going to be 10%. We're working on the different numbers."}
{"original": "Related: 6 reasons tax reform may not happen this year"}
{"original": "It's not clear when the White House will put forth a new proposal."}
{"original": "What seems increasingly evident, however, is that tax reform will not be completed this summer as originally promised and possibly not even this year. True tax reform is always harder than it seems. Plus, the process of repealing and replacing Obamacare is taking longer than expected and will push aside tax reform until lawmakers can come to some agreement."}
{"original": "Retirement investing is mostly contextual. So much depends on your risk tolerance, how much time you have before you retire, and how much you can save."}
{"original": "However, there are a few best practices that are nearly universal. So keep these in mind, whether you're a few years from retirement or still have decades to go."}
{"original": "Uncle Sam wants you saving for retirement, so the U.S. tax code has all kinds of incentives to sock away money for your golden years."}
{"original": "Your workplace retirement plan (whether 401(k), 403(b), TSP, etc.) comes with specific tax benefits. If it's a traditional 401(k) (or equivalent plan), you get to reduce your taxable income by a dollar for every dollar you put in. So if you save $18,500 (the limit for 2018 if you're under 50 years old; it's $24,500 if you're age 50 or older) in a 401(k), your taxable income will be reduced by $18,500 that year. That means you'd get to pocket a rather nice tax savings that year and not have to pay taxes on any of that money until you withdraw it in retirement."}
{"original": "Many workplace retirement plans also come in the Roth flavor -- which means you don't get to save on taxes this year, but that money won't be taxed at all in retirement. IRAs (which you can open on your own, and fund with up to $5,500 per year -- or $6,500 if you're age 55 or older) also come in both flavors. There are arguments for both, so learn more about Roth vs. Traditional accounts if you're unsure where you stand."}
{"original": "It's not just Uncle Sam who's trying to help you retire. Chances are good that, if your employer offers you access to a retirement plan like a 401(k), they also offer you some incentives to participate. Usually these incentives take the form of matching funds, whereby if you put a certain amount aside in your retirement plan, your employer will contribute some cash on top to help boost your account balance. For example, employers often offer a 50% match on contributions of up to 6% of an employee's salary. In that case, if you're setting aside 6% of your salary in your 401(k), your employer will contribute an additional amount equal to 3% of your salary."}
{"original": "In that example, you wouldn't get anything extra from your employer for anything you contribute above 6%, but you'd still get the tax benefits. Anyway, bottom line: At the very least, if at all possible, make sure you max out your employer match. Think about it this way: If you make $50,000 a year and contribute 6% for a 50% employer match, you're putting in $3,000 annually -- and your employer pays you an extra $1,500 in your 401(k) as a thank-you for doing that. That's a nice chunk of change."}
{"original": "A study published in 2015 estimated that American workers were leaving $24 billion in matching funds on the table each year (an average of $1,336 per worker who failed to take full advantage) by not maxing out their employer match. That's free money. Claim it."}
{"original": "Fees are one of the two great killers of investing returns -- second only to making bad investments. It can be difficult to predict how great or terrible an investment will be, but fortunately, fees are a lot easier to identify. And the savings are potentially huge. In fact, a 1-percentage-point reduction in fees could net you an extra $43,000 or more. How?"}
{"original": "Let's say you invested $3,000 per year for 30 years into a fund that tracks the S&P 500, returns 6% annually (a little less than historical stock market returns), and has a 1.14% expense ratio. At the end of 30 years, you'll have a little over $201,000. That's a nice chunk of change."}
{"original": "Now let's say you put the same amounts into the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFINX) over the same time period at the same hypothetical annual return. The Vanguard fund, however, has a 0.14% expense ratio -- that's 1 percentage point lower than the other fund's, all for the same exact investments. You'd end 30 years with a little over $244,000 -- an extra $43,000 -- by tracking the same underlying investment."}

{"original": "The superintendent says that the $1.8 billion is already earmarked for education spending during this three-year budget cycle. At this rate, LAUSD said, it might not even have enough money to meet a required 1% reserve by the 2021-2022 school year."}
{"original": "But UTLA President Alex Caputo-Pearl said the school district has always been wrong in their projections, so we just don't believe those numbers."}
{"original": "The district's three-year projections have always been wrong, Caputo-Pearl said Tuesday. Three years ago, they predicted a $105 million reserve; they ended with a $1.86 billion reserve. They were off by $1.7 billion."}

{"original": "Beutner said the state actually provides 90% of the district's funding, not LAUSD."}
{"original": "The union president acknowledged that much of the requested money would have to come from Sacramento, and said it's taking steps to try to get it."}
{"original": "We have been a big part of the fight for more state funding, Caputo-Pearl said. We're in conversations with the governor's office – that is a part of the puzzle. But that $2 billion reserve belongs with our students in classrooms. And that's an LAUSD issue."}

{"original": "I was asked yesterday by someone why I didn't just join teachers on the picket line, close our schools, and go to Sacramento (to) fight for more funding. Ninety percent of our funding comes from Sacramento, after all. … It's a fair question, Beutner said Tuesday."}
{"original": "Then I thought for a moment about Virgil Middle School and Telfair Elementary School."}
{"original": "At the middle school, 100% of the students in Virgil come from families living in poverty, Beutner said. And about 60% of those students went to school on the first day of the strike – much higher than the average for the rest of the district Monday."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- What a lousy campaign year. Neither party said what it meant or meant what it said."}
{"original": "Lacking either the courage of their convictions or just the convictions, themselves, Democrats did not dare whisper in public what they privately professed to believe: that basic fiscal sanity and fundamental social justice demand an immediate repeal of the future Bush tax-cuts for the Best-Off among us."}
{"original": "Revisionist and cowardly Republicans spent the year waist-high in Denial, fruitlessly rewriting history to insist that the word privatize-- as of Social Security -- had never passed their craven lips. Of course, privatize had been the exact term favored by many Republican pols ... until GOP pollsters discovered that voters, after watching the Dow-Jones drop like a rock, did not react positively to the idea of Kenny Boy Lay and his merry men of Enron managing their retirement savings."}
{"original": "What had been an undistinguished political year looked absolutely noble when compared to the dishonorable character defects of the resigned Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, R-Georgia, nationally televised on the October 27 Meet the Press."}
{"original": "For calculated deceit and deliberate dishonesty, the former speaker showed he is still a master of that sinister art. The program was only two days after the death of Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minnesota, and his wife and five others in a plane crash while on a re-election campaign trip. Former Vice President Walter Mondale was being urged to run for the Wellstone seat."}
{"original": "Here is what Newt Gingrich had to say: Walter Mondale chaired a commission that was for the privatization of Social Security worldwide. Added Gingrich, He chaired a commission that was for raising the retirement age dramatically. ... If you want to raise your retirement age dramatically and privatize Social Security, Walter Mondale is a terrifically courageous guy to say that."}
{"original": "This is vintage Newt. You begin with one true fact: Mondale did chair a commission at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a respected and thoroughly bipartisan Washington think tank that wrestles with global issues. And, yes, the commission did recommend market based financing for retirement programs for the industrial nations in place of pay-as-you-go."}
{"original": "But here is where it gets ugly. Mondale led the dissent from the majority views of the commission and strongly opposed (because) some of the commission's findings and recommendations could be interpreted as mandates to fundamentally change Social Security and Medicare."}
{"original": "Mondale's dissent rejected any commission plan that might result in the dismantling of social insurance programs and their replacement with funded (e.g. stock market) schemes. Gingrich deliberately and totally misrepresented Walter Mondale's clearly stated position on privatization of Social Security. The former speaker is undeniably bright. What he must have been seeking to do by his Big Lie was to poison the reputation of Mondale and thereby drain the enthusiasm for his candidacy from the army of Wellstone volunteers."}
{"original": "This is the same Gingrich who days before the 1994 election chose to exploit the horror of Susan Smith, the South Carolina woman who had drowned her two toddlers in the backseat of her car."}
{"original": "How a mother can kill her two children,14 months and 3 years, in hopes that her boyfriend would like her is just a sign of how sick the system is, observed Gingrich, and I think people want to change. The only way you get change is to vote Republican."}
{"original": "Four years later, Speaker Gingrich led a family values House Republican lynch mob bent on stringing up and impeaching the faithless and lying husband who was the president of the United States and a Democrat."}

{"original": "One thing about Donald Trump: He knows how to tell you what he's really thinking."}
{"original": "Consider this from Trump during the campaign in 2015, explaining the rationale for his favorite edifice:"}
{"original": "What I do best in life, I build. … I want it to be so beautiful because maybe someday they'll call it 'The Trump Wall.' Maybe. If they call this 'The Trump Wall,' it has to be beautiful."}
{"original": "There you go. The wall, for the President, is a monument. To himself. A visible legacy of his achievement; an example of what he considers himself best at: building and branding. It's not like tax reform or trade policy. It's actually concrete (or slats) and there for all the world to see as a Trump achievement. Even when he leaves the Oval Office. And way beyond."}
{"original": "If he could put his name on it in gold filigree, he would. But maybe calling it The Trump Wall is good enough."}
{"original": "This is not new for Donald Trump. His life has always been about the theatrical product. It's like the curtains opening at an opera, says biographer Michael D'Antonio. It's like a piece of scenery for his show."}
{"original": "Indeed. And as Trump produces this scene, his concern for the hundreds of thousands of furloughed government workers is lost, taking a back seat to his star, the wall. Kind of like Atlantic City 30 years ago when he was building other monuments to himself, inconspicuously named The Taj Mahal, for instance. The gilded splendor marketed as Trump mattered the most; paying the contractors what they were owed took a back seat. Always."}
{"original": "And so now he has boxed himself in. He truly believes the artifice he has constructed about both his great ability to build and his prowess at negotiating for permission to build. He did it in real estate, he tells us, and he was brilliant, or so he claims."}
{"original": "But now his monument is caught between his own grand vision and Democratic priorities for immigration reform, not to mention his party's far right. Trump probably longs for the good old days, when he could – and would – say just about anything in a room to test a real estate deal, especially since his company was not publicly held. Exaggeration was king, a perfect fit for Trump. Alan Pomerantz, who represented a group of Trump's creditors in the early 1990s, calls it puffing. Trump probably perfected the art of the hype."}
{"original": "Problem is, negotiating with Congress isn't like doing a real estate deal. In real estate, you can walk out of a room, as Trump did many times. But when he tried it with Chuck and Nancy it didn't work. In fact, it backfired."}

{"original": "The New Jersey Senate passed a bill Thursday that would gradually raise the state minimum wage to $15 an hour. Currently it's $8.38."}
{"original": "The measure has already been approved by the state Assembly, so the next stop is Gov. Chris Christie's desk."}
{"original": "The expectation, however, is that Christie will veto it. But his spokesman would only say that the governor has to see the final piece of legislation before making that call. Nevertheless, Christie has been highly critical of the proposal, citing it as reckless."}
{"original": "If Christie doesn't veto the bill, New Jersey would become the third state -- behind California and New York -- to be on track toward a $15 minimum. And just last week, the District of Columbia passed a similar measure that the mayor is expected to sign."}
{"original": "If he does veto it, advocates may get their way through other means. Proponents have said they will put the measure on the 2017 ballot to let voters decide whether the state should move toward a $15 minimum wage."}
{"original": "That's what they did in 2013. When Christie vetoed a much smaller increase, voters approved a constitutional amendment that raised the then-$7.25 minimum wage by $1 and indexed it to inflation."}
{"original": "The bill passed by the New Jersey Senate on Thursday would raise the $8.38 minimum to $10.10 in 2017, and then by at least $1.25 every year thereafter until 2021. At that point it would continue to be inflation adjusted."}

{"original": "The IRS, in turn, does its best to keep certain facts under wraps -- either because it would make it easier for the agency if people don't know these details, or because taxpayers can use this information to get some of their money back ."}
{"original": "1. You probably won't be audited"}
{"original": "In recent years, the IRS's budget has been repeatedly slashed. As a result, it's been forced to reduce its personnel, including auditors. The inevitable result is a steep decline in audit rates: Fewer than 1% of taxpayers are audited these days, and as the budget cuts continue, this rate will likely drop further."}
{"original": "However, this doesn't give you carte blanche to throw whatever numbers you like into your tax return. Setting aside the ethical issues of cheating on your taxes, there's no guarantee that the IRS' budget or priorities won't change in the near future (before the statute of limitations runs out on your current tax return). So while it's natural to be happy that you are extremely unlikely to be audited, don't push your luck. Claiming legitimate deductions that you might otherwise be too nervous to take is one thing; committing tax fraud is entirely different."}
{"original": "2. The IRS may owe you interest"}
{"original": "The IRS spells it out loud and clear that taxpayers owe the agency interest and penalties for late payments, but it's significantly quieter about the fact that if the IRS is late giving you your tax refund, it will owe interest to you. If the IRS doesn't issue you your refund within 45 days of the returns due date or the date it accepted your tax return (whichever comes later), it owes you interest for every day that the refund is late."}
{"original": "Note that the timing rule means that you can't cheat by turning your return in late, then claiming that the IRS owes you interest because it's been more than 45 days since the return due date."}
{"original": "The IRS's interest rates change quarterly; for first quarter 2017, the rate is 4%."}
{"original": "3. Qualified charitable distributions in lieu of RMDs"}
{"original": "Once you hit age 70½, the IRS requires you to withdraw a certain minimum amount from your tax-deferred retirement accounts every year. It doesn't want you to be able to hang on to that money forever; after a certain point, it wants to be able to start collecting taxes on the money in these accounts. Thus, you'll be forced to take distributions (and pay taxes on them) whether or not you actually need the income. And because the distributions are taxed as income, this can cause all kinds of other tax complications such as raising your tax bracket (and your capital gains rate as a result), and making your Social Security benefits partially taxable."}
{"original": "You can't get out of taking the required minimum distribution from your tax-deferred accounts unless you're willing to pay a grotesquely high 50% penalty, but you can avoid paying income taxes on that money by donating it to charity instead of keeping it yourself. This would count as an RMD, but it would help decrease your tax liability."}
{"original": "In order for this to work, the distribution has to go straight from the retirement account to the charity -- you can't pull out the money and then write a check to the charity of your choice. Consult with your retirement account's trustee or your financial adviser to learn the nitty-gritty details of how to manage this transaction so as to meet IRS requirements."}
{"original": "4. Removing the penalty on early withdrawals from retirement accounts"}
{"original": "Take money out of your tax-deferred IRA or 401(k) before age 59½, and the IRS will slap a 10% penalty tax on the distribution (in addition to taxing the distribution as income). However, there's an exception that's available to all: the substantially equal periodic payment rule."}
{"original": "What this rule says, in brief, is that if you commit to taking exactly the same amount from your retirement account every year -- an amount figured by one of three calculation methods offered by the IRS -- you won't have to pay penalties on the distributions. The three calculation methods are based on how much money you have in your retirement accounts, and on life expectancy tables provided by the IRS."}

{"original": "• 7 of 8 People Are Clueless About This Trillion-Dollar Market"}
{"original": "Note that this is not an exception you should take advantage of unless you really, really need to. There are significant drawbacks: You have to keep taking the distributions for at least five years or until you reach age 59½, and taking money out of your retirement accounts before you retire can cause you serious financial hardship later on. However, if you do end up needing the money before 59½, at least you have a way to avoid the 10% penalty."}

{"original": "The infrastructure decisions Americans made in the past echo today. Infrastructure investment has connected the people and industries of our vast continent with rails and roads, and it has saved lives in our cities with modern water and sewer systems."}
{"original": "But short-sighted infrastructure decisions have also caused serious harm – from the demolition of urban neighborhoods for freeways in the 1950s and 1960s to the flooding of irreplaceable natural gems such as Arizona's Glen Canyon during the dam-building years of the mid-20th century."}
{"original": "The stakes in the current infrastructure debate are high. But what matters most is not the size of any federal infrastructure package, nor how it is financed, nor even how many jobs it creates in the coming years. What matters most is building the infrastructure that will enable America to respond to the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century."}
{"original": "Any infrastructure package that incentivizes the wrong investments or unwisely rolls back crucial environmental, public health and safety regulations in the name of short-term profits could waste taxpayer money or, even worse, hurt the nation's future health and well-being."}
{"original": "The New Deal infrastructure programs of the 1930s are famous for putting unemployed Americans back to work, but that isn't all they achieved. Back then, economic opportunity was constrained by lack of access to good roads and electricity across much of the country. The iconic infrastructure of the New Deal – from the Merritt Parkway in Connecticut to the power systems of the Tennessee Valley Authority – addressed those needs, helping to position the nation for 20th century success."}
{"original": "What is needed to advance America now?"}
{"original": "Answering that question begins with knowing what we don't need to build. America already has too much infrastructure that we don't maintain adequately, or which we don't use to its fullest potential. Research indicates that fixing existing roads, for example, delivers greater return on investment than expanding them. We don't need new pipelines to distribute even more dangerous fossil fuels nearly as much as we need to fix existing pipeline leaks."}
{"original": "And we should prioritize stewardship of our existing green infrastructure of wetlands and forests – the natural lands that absorb floodwaters and filter out pollutants before they reach our rivers, streams and lakes. Doing so will minimize the cost of the water and sewer system upgrades we need to deliver safe drinking water to our families and keep our rivers and lakes clean."}
{"original": "When we do build, we need to keep 21st century priorities front and center, and incorporate the revolutionary knowledge and technologies spawned over the decades since America's last infrastructure overhaul."}
{"original": "As more households transition from just consuming energy to also producing energy with solar panels and other renewable technologies, we will need to build a modern, decentralized electric grid to accommodate them. Rural Americans today need access to broadband Internet the way they once needed electricity. As Americans, especially millennials, look for new transportation options without the stress and cost of driving, we need to provide them with new choices, such as convenient public transportation. And since whatever we construct today will be expected to last for a long time, our investments must make sense in an era of climate change."}

{"original": "Moreover, we need to make sure that the money we spend – either in the form of direct investment or tax breaks – results in infrastructure that is managed for the public interest. Conducting a fire sale of our current publicly owned assets to finance a new wave of infrastructure construction, or subsidizing the construction of infrastructure for private benefit, could leave America weaker, not stronger, as we face the challenges of the modern era."}
{"original": "With a smart approach to infrastructure that is grounded in 21st century needs, our children and grandchildren can look back with gratitude at the wisdom of our choices. Without one, they will look back in disappointment at the precious opportunities – not to mention dollars – we wasted."}

{"original": "The Internal Revenue Service is bringing back tens of thousands of additional federal employees with less than two weeks before tax filing season begins."}
{"original": "The federal tax collector said Tuesday in an undated government shutdown plan that it would recall an additional 36,000 federal employees, bringing the total number of those working at the IRS during the partial government shutdown to more than 46,000, or roughly 57% of the workforce."}
{"original": "The move will allow Americans to get their tax refunds on time, but at the expense of the IRS employees, most of whom won't be paid."}
{"original": "Only 809 federal employees in two specific areas of the agency will get their paychecks because their operations are funded by user fees."}
{"original": "The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents roughly 70,000 IRS workers around the country, said Tuesday that the executive branch can't continue to force more and more employees to show up in exchange for an IOU."}
{"original": "There is no doubt the IRS needs to get ready for the 2019 filing season that starts Jan. 28, and IRS employees want to work, union president Tony Reardon said in a statement. But the hard, cold reality is that they've already missed a paycheck and soon they'll be asked to work for free for as long as the shutdown lasts."}
{"original": "This year's tax filing season begins on Jan 28."}
{"original": "The IRS is part of Treasury, one of the federal agencies affected by the government shutdown that's now in its 25th day. Since the shutdown, it has been operating with only 12.5% of its workforce, or fewer than 10,000 employees."}
{"original": "Facing potential political blowback over delays in processing refunds, the agency committed to paying out tax refunds, reversing a long-standing policy that refunds due to individuals and corporations would go unpaid during a shutdown."}
{"original": "Tax refunds will go out, Russell Vought, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, told reporters on Jan. 7. He added that the Trump administration is working to make the shutdown as painless as possible, consistent with the law."}
{"original": "A senior administration official told CNN at the time that the change was supported by a 2011 IRS memo that argued tax refunds can be paid out during a shutdown."}
{"original": "Under President Barack Obama, the general counsel of the Office of Management and Budget overrode the IRS, saying refunds could not be paid until the government opens. Faced with the latest shutdown, the Treasury Department asked the current OMB general counsel to revisit the 2011 memo and the guidance was revised to allow refunds to be paid after a supplemental memo was submitted to OMB."}
{"original": "A federal judge on Tuesday denied a request from the Treasury union for an order blocking the government from asking employees to work without pay, one of several cases challenging the administration policy."}
{"original": "It's an open question whether recalled workers will be able to claim unemployment insurance since the laws vary state by state.

{"original": "China has a message for the Davos crowd: Fear about an economic slowdown is overblown."}
{"original": "In a speech at the World Economic Forum, Vice President Wang Qishan said that growth remains substantial, and that it's important for China to focus on the long term."}
{"original": "There will be a lot of uncertainties in 2019, but something that is certain is that China's growth will continue and will be sustainable, he said Wednesday."}
{"original": "Earlier this week, China reported that its economy grew 6.6% in 2018, the slowest pace in almost three decades."}
{"original": "Activity has been hit by government efforts to rein in high levels of debt with the aim of putting the vast economy on more stable footing. Momentum has also been blunted by the trade war with the United States, which has led to tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese exports."}
{"original": "Wang, for his part, took a glass-half-full view of the data."}
{"original": "I think [6.6%] is a pretty significant number, he said. Not low. At all."}
{"original": "Wang said that the Communist Party is trying to remind people that speed does matter, but what really matters for the time being is the quality and efficiency of development."}
{"original": "Chinese officials have echoed this sanguine take throughout the week."}
{"original": "Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said at a panel on Tuesday that growth as low as 6% would not be a disaster."}
{"original": "Still, concerns about China's slowdown and what it means for global growth have rattled markets."}
{"original": "Chen Xingdong, chief China economist at BNP Paribas, said Wednesday that Beijing faces the most difficult economic situation since the global financial crisis."}
{"original": "Growth is slowing down quite dramatically, Chen told reporters. The magnitude of the slowdown has been intensifying."}
{"original": "China has been working to support growth through a combination of looser monetary policy and fiscal stimulus such as tax cuts for small businesses."}
{"original": "And bright spots do remain. Retail sales in China are set to reach more than $5.6 trillion this year, about $100 billion more than in the United States, according to a report published Wednesday by research firm eMarketer."}
{"original": "But the specter of tougher trade penalties looms."}
{"original": "China and the United States are racing to cut a deal on trade before March 1, when tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods will otherwise rise to 25% from 10%. Negotiations with top officials are scheduled later this month in Washington, although an invitation by Beijing to hold preliminary talks this week was rejected by the White House."}
{"original": "BNP Paribas sees a 60% to 70% chance that a US-China trade deal gets done. The alternative is grim, and would cause a massive increase in job losses, Chen said."}
{"original": "Wang appeared to take a jab at the Trump administration and to offer an olive branch at the same time."}
{"original": "Shifting blame for one's own problems onto others will not resolve the problems, he said in prepared remarks."}

If they need more information -- you need more information, that's the place to go: cnnpolitics.com."}
{"original": "I want to begin the second part of this debate with a question for Senator Obama, and I want to refer to Congressman Charlie Rangel, one of the most powerful members, one of the most powerful members of the House of Representatives, and specifically on this Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, a day so important to all of us here in the United States."}
{"original": "He's a supporter of Hillary Clinton and he said yesterday, and I'm quoting now, that he likes you, Senator Obama. He's very proud of your accomplishments. But he went on to say that Black voters should not do what makes us feel good, but what's good for our great nation."}
{"original": "And I wonder if you want to respond to that notion that it may make a lot of African-Americans feel good to vote for you, but it might not necessarily be the best thing for the United States."}
{"original": "OBAMA: Well, first of all, Charlie's absolutely right that African-Americans should vote for what's best for them, their children, and this country, and the same way that I think Hillary..."}
{"original": "... you know, Hillary feels that women should vote for what's best for them, their children, and their country."}
{"original": "EDWARDS: Would you mind saying that..."}
{"original": "OBAMA: And the same way that John..."}
{"original": "EDWARDS: Say that a little more often."}
{"original": "OBAMA: Absolutely. Same way that John, I think, he wants white males to vote for..."}
{"original": "OBAMA: So I think Charlie's right in principle. Now, obviously, he and I differ in terms of what would be best for the nation. I wouldn't be running if I didn't think that I could bring the country together most effectively, that I can overcome the special interests in Washington most effectively, that I can inspire the American people to get involved in their government most effectively."}
{"original": "So his principle is right. He just has miscalculated in his equation. But I get along great with Charlie, so I'm sure that -- as president, I look forward to working with him as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee to get things done for families of America."}
{"original": "BLITZER: I'll move on to the next question from Suzanne unless either of you want to make a comment."}
{"original": "MALVEAUX: It's kind of related to Senator Edwards. I've spoken with a lot of African American voters in South Carolina this week, and a lot of them say that electing a black president, that this would change the way whites see African Americans and the way African Americans see themselves."}
{"original": "Do you think that this is a valid consideration for voters in determining who's president?"}
{"original": "EDWARDS: Well, first of all, I don't think it's for me to tell anybody, and particularly not African Americans, what they should consider when they're voting. I think they ought to be able to consider anything that they think is fair and reasonable and important to them."}
{"original": "What I would say, though, is on the issue, since we are here on Dr. King's day, on the issues of equality, ending poverty in America, the things that he devoted so much of his life to, no one has been -- and with all respect to the two other candidates, no one has been more aggressive on these issues than I have."}
{"original": "I mean, ending poverty is the cause, the single most important cause in my life. I'm not suggesting for a minute the two of them haven't spoken about it, because they obviously have. But I have made it central to what I'm doing, central to my campaign and I have been trying to drive it in this campaign and welcome everything they have to say."}
{"original": "I have a comprehensive set of ideas about how we end poverty in this country. I think it is a huge moral issue facing the United States of America, and it is an enormous issue facing the African American community."}
{"original": "If you're black, you're much more likely to be poor, you're much less likely to have health care coverage. That community is hurt worse by poverty than any community in America. And it's our responsibility, not just for the African American community, but for America, as a nation, to take on this moral challenge, to try as best we can to walk in the shadow of Dr. King and try to make certain that we take this cause on, and I intend to do it."}
{"original": "It will be central to the work that I do as president of the United States, ending poverty in America."}
{"original": "BLITZER: Let's let Senator Clinton respond, and then Senator Obama."}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, I respect John's commitment to ending poverty. That's why, 35 years ago, when I graduated from law school, I didn't go to work for a law firm. I went to work for Marian Wright Edelman at the Children's Defense Fund, because ending poverty -- particularly ending poverty for children, has been the central core cause of everything that I've been doing for 35 years."}
{"original": "I care deeply about what for me is a mission and it does infuse everything that I do and why I'm in public office and why before I was in public service, chairing the Legal Services Corporation so that people got free legal aid when they would otherwise be put out of the courthouse, standing up time and time again for health care and education for abused and neglected kids and kids in the foster care system."}
{"original": "But I think that what we want to do is have a little reality check here, because how is it best to end poverty? We know we've got to maintain programs that are there to help people in need, but look at what's happened over the space of the last seven years. The average African American family has lost $2,600 in income."}
{"original": "Compare that to the prior eight years, when we had a president who took on the fights of the '90s and stood up against the Republicans, often at great cost. And the typical African American family went up $7,600 during the 1990s."}
{"original": "We know we've got to attack poverty by making sure the economy works for everybody. We have to lift up the idea of good jobs with good benefits, and I think that we know what we need to do. And if we have a president who is willing from day one to make it a mission to create shared prosperity again, that's going to be good for every American. And that's what I'm going to offer as president. That's what I've been talking about, that's what I've been working for and that's what I intend to do. And I think we can get results for every American."}
{"original": "OBAMA: Well, I think John has run a terrific campaign and has focused on poverty during the campaign."}
{"original": "But, John, I have to say, first of all, I have put forward a comprehensive poverty plan that talks about early childhood education, health care for children, dealing with ex-offenders."}
{"original": "And I'll be, you know, happy to share it with you. I know that you don't have time to read all my stuff, just as I don't have time to read yours."}
{"original": "But understand this. I haven't just been talking about..."}
{"original": "EDWARDS: Maybe I can read it when I can't go to sleep at night."}
{"original": "That's when I usually read my stuff, actually. But I think it's important."}
{"original": "It's not just talking about it during a campaign. You know, as I said, I started my career after college working in low-income neighborhoods, working in public housing projects, talking to children when you grow up? They say, I want to be a doctor, or, I want to be a lawyer, had the same aspirations as every other child, but they were three, four grade levels behind."}
{"original": "And nobody had told them that the likelihood of them accomplishing their goals were each year diminished because we weren't putting the money in to make sure that they could actually achieve it."}
{"original": "And that's what I did as a civil rights attorney. That's what I did as a state legislator, providing health care for people who didn't have it, making sure that we are providing tax relief to those who need it, as opposed to those who don't."}
{"original": "So I want to make clear, John, that I think a lifetime commitment is how people are going to have to measure these issues."}
{"original": "One last point I want to make, because I think the media, you know, has really been focused a lot on race as we move down to South Carolina. And I have to say that, as I travel around South Carolina, I am absolutely convinced that white, black, Latino, Asian, people want to move beyond our divisions, and they want to join together..."}
{"original": "... in order to create a movement for change in this country."}
{"original": "And, I mean, I'm not entirely faulting the media because, look, race is a factor in our society. There's no doubt that in a race where you've got an African-American, and a woman, and John..."}
{"original": "... there's no doubt that that has piqued interest, but I guess what I'm saying is I don't want to sell the American people short."}
{"original": "They are desperate to move beyond the same, old arguments that we've been having and start actually getting something done in this country. And that's what the Democratic Party has been about."}
{"original": "The Republicans may have a different attitude, because they haven't been appearing before forums that are diverse. And the policies, frankly, that they've promoted -- and here I think all three of us agree -- the policies that they have promoted have not been good at providing ladders for upward mobility and opportunity for all people."}
{"original": "That is a fight that all of us will fight. But I don't want us to get drawn into this notion that somehow this is going to be a race that splits along racial lines."}
{"original": "EDWARDS: Well, first of all, before I ever was involved in politics at all, I was involved with Urban Ministries in North Carolina, which is a group that takes care of the poorest of the poor, the homeless, the people who are struggling."}
{"original": "There are a lot of Americans -- I've bet some people here won't know this -- but I've been in a fight with Bill O'Reilly -- that's a fight I'd love to be in, by the way -- I've been in a fight with Bill O'Reilly about whether we, in fact, have 200,000 men and women who wore our uniform who are homeless every single night."}
{"original": "They are. There's absolutely no question about that. And anybody in this audience who's paying attention knows it."}
{"original": "But what I worry about is all the work that I've done at the poverty center that I started at the university, the work I did before I got involved in politics, all the substantive ideas, what I worry about is this starts to sound like a statistic."}
{"original": "You know, we talk about 37 million Americans who live in poverty -- that's more than the population of California -- in the richest nation on the planet."}
{"original": "I've been to hundreds of places around this country who take care of the poorest of the poor, extraordinary, wonderful places. But I'll never forget, just a year or so ago, I was with a woman in Kansas City who told me the story -- worked full-time, worked full-time. She had several children."}
{"original": "Every night in the winter, she could not pay both her heating bill and her rent. She had to choose. Single mom, working full-time, she had to put her kids in all of their winter clothing, in their coats, bundle them up in the bed together, put as many blankets on top of them as she could."}
{"original": "And she'd get them out of bed in the morning and send them off to school. And the last thing she would say to them? Please, for goodness's sakes, don't tell anybody at school what's happening here, because they'll come and take you away from me."}
{"original": "EDWARDS: No mother in America should have to live like that. We are a better country than that."}
{"original": "JOHNS: Senator Obama, appreciating what you said about the media's preoccupation with race, there is..."}
{"original": "JOHNS: Right. The Nobel Prize-winning African-American author, Toni Morrison, famously observed about Bill Clinton, This is our first black president, blacker than any actual black person who could ever be elected in our children's lifetime."}
{"original": "Do you think Bill Clinton was our first black president?"}
{"original": "OBAMA: Well, I think Bill Clinton did have an enormous affinity with the African-American community, and still does. And I think that's well earned."}
{"original": "Like John, one of the things that I'm always inspired by -- no, I'm -- this I'm serious about. I'm always inspired by young men and women who grew up in the South when segregation was still taking place, when, you know, the transformations that are still incomplete but at least had begun had not yet begun. And to see that transformations in their own lives I think that is powerful, and it is hopeful, because what it indicates is that people can change."}
{"original": "And each successive generation can, you know, create a different vision of how, you know, we have to treat each other. And I think Bill Clinton embodies that. I think he deserves credit for that."}
{"original": "OBAMA: I have to say that, you know, I would have to, you know, investigate more of Bill's dancing abilities."}
{"original": "OBAMA: You know, and some of this other stuff before I accurately judge whether he was in fact a brother. But..."}
{"original": "BLITZER: Let's let Senator Clinton weigh in on that."}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, I'm sure that can be arranged."}
{"original": "CLINTON: You know, I want to echo what Barack has said and what each of us has said repeatedly over the last days. You know, this campaign is obviously an incredible opportunity for so many people to become involved, to be part of making history."}
{"original": "You have got a son of the South. You've got an African-American. You have a woman. What better way to celebrate the legacy of Dr. King than to look at this stage right here tonight?"}
{"original": "CLINTON: And, you know, I'm reminded of one of my heroes, Frederick Douglas, who had on the masthead of his newspaper in upstate New York, The North Star, that right has no sex and truth has no color. And that is really the profound message of Dr. King."}
{"original": "You know, the content of our character, who we are as people. And I think that my pride in being part of this campaign -- now, look, it's a hard-fought campaign."}
{"original": "We have differences, but it would be unbecoming of any of us to not share those differences and to make the points we're making because we are competing for the most important job in the world at a time when our country has been disgraced abroad, when we have denied and ignored the problems that are afflicting people in South Carolina and across America, when we know we will inherit a huge amount of damage from President Bush upon taking office on January 20th, 2009, whoever the next president is."}
{"original": "So we are passionate about our cause, our candidacy, what we believe, what we want to do for America. And it is a great privilege for me to be part of this. And I think it's important that we stay focused on the future, what we are going to do together to make our country once again what it should be, to deal with this myriad of problems that await, because we can bring our country together and we can set big goals again."}
{"original": "We can start acting like Americans and solve those problems together, and that's what I want to do."}
{"original": "OBAMA: And I have to say, Wolf, that I especially appreciate the fact that Hillary and John were giving me a tough time, because that shows I'm doing pretty good."}
{"original": "I would be upset if there was too much civility in this debate, because it is competitive."}
{"original": "One last point I want to make about this, though, and John alluded to it on the poverty issue."}
{"original": "The one thing we -- when I say we should not focus on my race or Hillary's gender in terms of choosing a candidate, that is not to say that we should be ignoring the very real problems that still exist in terms of race in America."}
{"original": "So for example, if we know that in our criminal justice system, African-Americans and whites, for the same crime, receive -- are arrested at very different rates, are convicted at very different rates, receive very different sentences."}
{"original": "That is something that we have to talk about. But that's a substantive issue and it has to do with how do we pursue racial justice."}
{"original": "If I am president, I will have a civil rights division that is working with local law enforcement so that they are enforcing laws fairly and justly. But I would expect..."}
{"original": "... a white president or a woman president should want to do the same thing, because I believe that the pursuit of racial equality, of the perfection of this union, is not just a particular special interest issue of the African-American community. That is how all of us are going to move forward."}
{"original": "And to the extent that we don't deal with those issues, those longstanding, deep seeded issues, we will continue to be hampered. We will be competing with the world with one hand tied behind our backs."}
{"original": "CLINTON: And, you know, Wolf, the..."}
{"original": "... the challenge is for us to address all of these issues. We obviously still have problems of gender equality. You know, equal pay is not yet equal."}
{"original": "A woman makes $0.77 on a dollar and women of color make $0.67. So there is a big agenda waiting for the Democratic Party. And we feel so passionately about this because we not only are running for office, but we each, in our own way, have lived it."}
{"original": "We have seen it. We have understood the pain and the injustice that has come because of race, because of gender. And it's imperative that, as we move forward with our campaign, we make it very clear that each of us will address these issues."}
{"original": "You don't hear the Republicans talking about any of this. You don't hear them talking about the disgrace of a criminal justice system that incarcerates so many more African-Americans proportionately than whites. You don't hear any kind of effort to help Historically Black Colleges and Universities, something that I'm committed to doing in order to..."}
{"original": "... make it clear that these are important institutions that have led the way for so many great leaders to be where they are today."}
{"original": "So we have a specific set of policies and priorities that are really part of who we are, as well as part of what the Democratic Party stands for."}
{"original": "BLITZER: I'm going to let the son of the south wrap this subject up and then we'll move on to Suzanne."}
{"original": "EDWARDS: Well, I appreciate what both of them said about the transformative effect of having lived with this. I mean, I grew up, I was born here in South Carolina, grew up in South Carolina, Georgia and North Carolina, and, in my early years, I lived in the segregated south."}
{"original": "I mean, I saw up close the impact it had on people's lives and I saw up close the blood, sweat and tears and lives of those, including some people who are in this audience tonight, what they went through to bring about this change."}
{"original": "And there is a great deal -- Hillary says the Republicans don't talk about it. There's some things we don't talk about, either, and if you look at what's..."}
{"original": "... if you look at what's happening, my father, who, I mentioned earlier, is sitting in the audience, he raised me to believe that the men and women who worked in the mill with him were worth every bit as much as the man that owned that mill."}
{"original": "And if we really believe that every American is of equal value, no matter who their family is, where the live or what the color of their skin -- when are we going to start living together? Because you look at what's happening -- I announced my campaign from the ninth ward of New Orleans."}
{"original": "I think a lot of America was shocked to see those pictures coming out of the ninth ward. And you can't pick on New Orleans. The same thing's true in many communities all over this country."}
{"original": "I mean, we have got to -- both in housing policy and economic policy and every other way -- create the kind of opportunity for people to be able to move. It shouldn't just be that rich folks are able to, if they don't like their neighborhood or don't like their school or are worried about crime in their neighborhood, they're the only ones that can go somewhere else."}
{"original": "Everybody in America ought to have that chance, at the same time that we're investing in a serious way to improving all of our neighborhoods."}
{"original": "MALVEAUX: To Senator Clinton. In New Hampshire, you said you found your own voice, but increasingly there are people who believe that it's your husband's voice that has become too loud."}
{"original": "MALVEAUX: Congressman Clyburn earlier said today, I think he can afford to tone it down. Is there a risk that he is overshadowing your message and your voice?"}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, I think that he is very much advocating on my behalf, and I appreciate that. He is a tremendous asset. And he feels very strongly about this country and what's at stake and what out future should be."}
{"original": "I believe that this campaign is not about our spouses. It is about us. It is about each of us individually. Michelle and Elizabeth are strong and staunch advocates for their husbands, and I respect that."}
{"original": "But, at the end of the day, voters are going to have to choose among us, and I think it's fair to say that really the most important decision is who would be the best president on day one, to deal with all the problems that we know are waiting for our next president? And the subsidiary question is, who can best withstand the Republicans and all that we know is coming from them in order to win in November 2008?"}
{"original": "I believe strongly that I can make the best case for that. Obviously, my colleagues believe just as strongly."}
{"original": "So I think that we need to keep our focus on what's at stake in the election, what the future holds, what each of us will bring to this campaign and the presidency, because ultimately it's really not about any of us. It's about the people of South Carolina. It's about the people of America."}
{"original": "And my voice is their voice. What I want to do is take not only my 35 years of experience into the White House, but I want to take all those voices of these extraordinary Americans who come up to me and tell me their stories and give me hope and inspiration that I can do something for them. Because that's what it's about for me."}
{"original": "Politics is not a game. It is the most serious of business. We have seen that over the last seven years. We have seen what a difference it makes when we have a president who is indifferent to and insensitive about the real-life struggles of Americans, and I want to be the champion that once again gives Americans the feeling that they have a president who cares about them and can produce results for them. And that's what I intend to do."}
{"original": "BLITZER: I'm going to let both of the other senators respond. Then we'll take a quick break."}
{"original": "OBAMA: Well, Hillary's right. All of us have extraordinarily smart and effective advocates in our spouses."}
{"original": "And, as I've said before, I do not at all begrudge -- I would expect that Bill Clinton would campaign vigorously on your behalf. Obviously, he's the ex-president, so that means that the gets a lot of outsized attention and there's nothing long with that. That's, as you said, an asset to the campaign."}
{"original": "I have been troubled, and we already had this discussion, so I don't want to go over it again, the degree to which my record is not accurately portrayed. But that's standard practice in some of our political battles."}
{"original": "What I do want to focus on, though, is how important it is, when you talked about taking on the Republicans, how important it is I think to redraw the political map in this country. And the reason I say that is that we have gone through the 2000 election, the 2004 election, both of which were disappointing elections."}
{"original": "But the truth is that we as Democrats have not had a working majority in a very long time. And what I mean by that is a working majority that could push through the kinds of bold initiatives that all of us have proposed. And one of the reasons that I am running for president is because I believe that I can inspire new people to get involved in the process, that I can reach out to independents and, yes, some Republicans who have also lost trust in their government and want to see something new."}
{"original": "When you look at Bush and Cheney and their record, the one good thing they've done for us is they have given their party a very bad name."}
{"original": "That gives us a unique opportunity in this election, and what we can't do, I think, is just to take the playing field as a given. We want to expand the scope of the electorate so that we can start getting a 60 percent majority, more folks in the House, more folks in the Senate, and I think that's something I can do."}
{"original": "OBAMA: And that's why we've seen record turnout in every election so far. I'm not taking all the credit for it. I think people are voting against George Bush. But I also think that we've inspired people who had not previously voted before, and that's what the Democratic Party has to do."}
{"original": "EDWARDS: I would just add on it's just really important for primary voters in South Carolina and all the other subsequent primaries to understand they're not just voting in a primary."}
{"original": "They're voting to establish what we're going to be doing next November and who our candidate will be next November. And it's becoming increasingly likely, I think, that John McCain is going to be the Republican candidate."}
{"original": "Now, here's what we have to be thinking about. Who will be tough enough and strong enough? And who can compete against John McCain in every place in America?"}
{"original": "You know, I believe that I won't just be here campaigning in the South Carolina primary. When I'm the Democratic nominee, I'll be back in South Carolina campaigning for the general election."}
{"original": "And we can't concede places like South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Missouri, all these places around America where we know, everyone knows, that we always do well -- all three of us have been through this -- we always do well in Chicago, or New York, or Los Angeles, Seattle."}
{"original": "We do well in the big urban areas. The question is: Are we competitive in the rural areas, in the tougher places for Democrats to compete?"}
{"original": "And the only thing I would say -- and I think it has nothing to do with race and gender. Let me be really clear about that. It's amazing now that being the white male..."}
{"original": "OBAMA: You're feeling all defensive about it, John. It's all right, man."}
{"original": "What I was going to say, though, is being able to go everywhere in America and campaign and to compete -- and I grew up in the rural south, in small towns all across the rural south, and I think I can go everywhere and compete head-to-head with John McCain."}
{"original": "And, actually, the last time I saw one of your polls that had all three of us against John McCain, I was the one that beat John McCain everywhere in America."}
{"original": "And I think we need to be able to have a candidate when people are voting -- it's not the only consideration. Lord knows, if you don't agree with what we stand for, and you don't believe in us, our character and our ability to lead this country, you should not vote for us, no matter what it means for the general election."}
{"original": "But if you believe in our passion, our strength, our toughness, our independence from these special interests -- I've never taken money from a Washington lobbyist or a special interest PAC, which is different than these two guys, over our whole career."}
{"original": "But what I would say that I think what that means is I can go anywhere in America and compete against John McCain and win."}
{"original": "BLITZER: We have to take a quick break, but we have a lot more to talk about, much more of this presidential debate here in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, when we come back."}
{"original": "OBAMA: ... where in northern Nevada, in places like Elko, I won by 30 points. And we were attracting Independents and some Republicans. You know, this is the same way that I was able to win the election in Illinois, going to downstate Illinois. So, I think it's important for us not to assume that we can't reach out to people of all -- of all persuasions, and I want to just take one last example on this, and that is on the issue of faith."}
{"original": "OBAMA: You know, I am a proud Christian. And the..."}
{"original": "I think there have been times -- there have been times where our Democratic Party did not reach out as aggressively as we could to evangelicals, for example, because the assumption was, well, they don't agree with us on choice, or they don't agree with us on gay rights, and so we just shouldn't show up. And when you don't show up, if you're not going to church, then you're not talking to church folk. And that means that people have a very right-wing perspective in terms of what faith means and of defining our faith."}
{"original": "OBAMA: And as somebody who believes deeply in the precepts of Jesus Christ, particularly treating the least of these in a way that he would, that it is important for us to not concede that ground. Because I think we can go after those folks and get them."}
{"original": "BLITZER: All right. Suzanne has a question on faith to all of you."}
{"original": "CLINTON: ... let me just get in here, because there are a lot of polls showing that I'm beating them higher than anybody else. I don't think that has -- I don't think, frankly, that has much to recommend this far from an election."}
{"original": "If John is right and Senator McCain is the Republican nominee, we know that once again we will have a general election about national security. That is what will happen."}
{"original": "I believe of any one of us, I am better positioned and better able to take on John McCain or any Republican when it comes to issues about protecting and defending our country and promoting our interest in the world. And if it is indeed the classic Republican campaign, I've been there. I've done that."}
{"original": "They've been after me for 16 years, and much to their dismay I am still here. And I intend to be still here when that election comes around and we win in November 2008."}
{"original": "EDWARDS: I just want to add that I think it's about -- I don't think it's about polls either, Hillary, by the way. But I do think it is about fundamental differences between us and them. And this is a difference that you and I have."}
{"original": "You know, I think that John McCain has made central to his time in public life, in his campaign, campaign finance reform and cleaning up the money in politics. And I think it's dangerous for us to send somebody against him who presents a contrast to what he represents. And I'm proud of the fact that I've never taken money from a Washington lobbyist or a special interest PAC."}
{"original": "EDWARDS: And I have a question -- I have a question that I'm interested in hearing you respond to. You've talked a lot about day one. I've committed -- I don't know what Barack has said about this -- but I've committed not to have any corporate lobbyists working in my White House on the first day that I'm president."}
{"original": "Will you make the same commitment?"}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, you know, John, I will make the commitment to have people in the White House who are honest and trustworthy and put the interests of the United States first. But I think..."}
{"original": "CLINTON: You know what? I don't know."}
{"original": "I don't know, because I'm not in favor of corporate lobbyists, but you keep drawing these artificial distinctions. You take money from people who employ lobbyists, who are married to lobbyists, who are the children of lobbyists."}
{"original": "And, you know, at some point this gets really hard to take, because if you are someone like I am, who has withstood the full force of corporate lobbyists, starting with the health insurance companies, and the drug companies, and the oil companies, and everybody that I've taken on for all of these years, you know, I think I'm independent and tough enough to be able to deal with anybody. And that's what I intend to do."}
{"original": "EDWARDS: Those people, though -- here's the problem, Hillary. Everybody is listening. They can make their own judgment about this. They don't have to depend on us. When somebody gives you millions and millions of dollars, I think they expect something. I don't think they're doing it for nothing."}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, John, trial lawyers have given you millions and millions of dollars. So..."}
{"original": "EDWARDS: And what they expect from me is they expect me to stand up for democracy, for the right to jury trial, for the right for little people to be heard in the courtroom. And that is exactly what I stand up for."}
{"original": "That is not the same thing. That is not the same thing as corporate lobbyists who are in there every single day lobbying against the interests of middle-class Americans. And I think we need a president who can stand up."}
{"original": "We have a difference about this. You're entitled to your view. But we have a real difference about it."}
{"original": "CLINTON: No, we don't have a real difference. Where we stand is -- where I stand is for public financing. I'm going to do everything I can to get public financing, to get the money out of American politics."}
{"original": "But, you know, Barack has a lot of lobbyists who are leading his campaign here in South Carolina. John has had lobbyists who've been working hard for him all of these years."}
{"original": "The point is that you've got to say no. You've got to say no."}
{"original": "CLINTON: And, yes, I think that we will say no consistently in order to have a positive agenda that is actually going to make a difference. Do you have to stand up to the lobbyists? Yes. But the lobbyists represent the interests that are paying the lobbyists. So to go and focus on the lobbyists, you know, kind of misses the point."}
{"original": "OBAMA: Let me just interject on this."}
{"original": "Hillary, you're right. Nobody's hands are perfectly clean in politics. That is true. I mean, there a distinction, though, between not taking PAC and federal lobbyist money and having that as a major way of driving your campaign and having some ancillary involvement."}
{"original": "But, you know, I don't want to go down that route. What I want to really focus on is this issue of national security, because I think you've repeated this a number of times. You are the person best prepared on national security issues on day one, and so if you're running against John McCain, that you can go toe-to-toe."}
{"original": "I fundamentally disagree with that. And I want to tell you why, because I believe that the way we are going to take on somebody like a John McCain on national security is not that we're sort of -- we've been sort of like John McCain, but not completely, you know, we voted for the war, but we had reservations."}
{"original": "I think it's going to be somebody who can serve a strong contrast and say, We've got to overcome the politics of fear in this country. As commander-in-chief..."}
{"original": "As commander-in-chief, all of us would have a responsibility to keep the American people safe. That's our first responsibility. And I would not hesitate to strike against anybody who would do Americans or American interests' harm."}
{"original": "OBAMA: Wait, Wolf, let me finish. I was listening to these folks quite some time."}
{"original": "What I do believe is that we have to describe a new foreign policy that says, for example, I will meet not just with our friends, but with our enemies, because I remember what John F. Kennedy said, that we should never negotiate out of fear, but we should never fear to negotiate."}
{"original": "Having that kind of posture is the way I think we effectively debate the Republicans on this issue. Because if we just play into the same fear-mongering that they have been engaged in since 9/11, then we are playing on their battlefield, but, more importantly, we are not doing what's right in order to rebuild our alliances, repair our relationships around the world, and actually make us more safe in the long term."}
{"original": "EDWARDS: And it requires that -- wait, wait. Both of them talked about it. You've got to let me say a word."}
{"original": "BLITZER: All right, 30 seconds, please."}
{"original": "EDWARDS: What it requires is having something beyond a short- term foreign policy of convenience. I mean, Bush has done extraordinary damage to us."}
{"original": "EDWARDS: But if we have a visionary foreign policy, where we re- establish America as a moral leader in the world, where we do the things that we need to do to combat global poverty, to deal with the spread of HIV/AIDS, the spread of disease at large, economic development, what it does is it takes an entire generation of young people who are sitting on the fence as I speak and on one side is Al Qaeda and Bin Laden, Islamic jihad, and on the other side is the United States of America, which way do they go?"}
{"original": "That depends entirely on us. If they continue to see this foreign policy of belligerence, selfishness, only interested in the expansion of American power, we will drive them in the other direction."}
{"original": "If, on the other hand, they see America as the light, the source of hope and opportunity, it will pull them to us like a magnet. We need to be that light again."}
{"original": "We are completely out of time, but we have time for one final question that I'd like to ask all three of you to respond and, if possible, within one minute or less, and it's an important question on this important day."}
{"original": "And, Senator Edwards, let me start with you. If Dr. Martin Luther King were alive today, unfortunately, he's not, but if he were alive today, why do you think he would or why should he endorse you?"}
{"original": "EDWARDS: For two reasons. One is that -- we've talked about this a great deal already -- I met with Martin III in Atlanta on Saturday and he was very kind about me pushing the single biggest issue -- two biggest issues that Dr. King stood for, which are the issues of equality and ending poverty in America."}
{"original": "I've been on at least part of his poor people's campaign. I was in Marks, Mississippi, among other places. I mean, I have been pushing this issue as aggressively and as loudly as I possibly can and I will do it as long as I'm alive, because it is central to what I believe."}
{"original": "He also worked very hard for the Voting Rights Act and he would look at an America today where almost half of our people don't vote. They're disenchanted. They -- Barack's spoken about this. They feel disengaged."}
{"original": "And what we need is a president of the United States who actually believes to their core in equality, who's willing to fight for that equality, who's willing to do things that may not be politically popular. And fighting to end poverty in America may not get you any votes, but it is the right thing to do."}
{"original": "OBAMA: Well, I don't think Dr. King would endorse any of us. I think what he would call upon the American people to do is to hold us accountable, and this goes to the core differences, I think, in this campaign."}
{"original": "I believe change does not happen from the top down. It happens from the bottom up. Dr. King understood that."}
{"original": "It was those women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus, union workers who are willing to take on violence and intimidation to get the right to organize. It was women who decided, I'm as smart as my husband. I'd better get the right to vote."}
{"original": "OBAMA: them arguing, mobilizing, agitating, and ultimately forcing elected officials to be accountable, I think that's the key."}
{"original": "So that has been a hallmark of my career, transparency and accountability, getting the American people involved. That's how we're going to bring about change. That's why I want to be president of the United States, to respect the power of the American people to bring about change."}
{"original": "CLINTON: Well, there is no doubt that change comes from the extraordinary efforts of the American people. I've seen it in my life. I'm sitting here as a result of that change."}
{"original": "It is also true -- and Dr. King understood this. He campaigned for political leaders. He lobbied them. He pushed them. He cajoled. He did everything he could to get them over the line so that they would be part of the movement that he gave his life for."}
{"original": "There are people sitting in this audience right now, John Lewis, Jim Clyburn, they were part of those kinds of efforts, going so far as they could to make it clear that we had to live up to our values and our ideals."}
{"original": "And then there was a meeting of morality and politics. And the political leaders finally responded."}
{"original": "The American people should not have to work so hard to get leaders who will actually help them and recognize we are strongest when we lead by our values. Dr. King transformed the lives of so many of us, and I intend to do whatever I can to make his legacy real in the lives of Americans."}
{"original": "BLITZER: Senators, that ends our debate. Thank you so very much. Thanks to all of you."}

{"original": "Story highlights More than 55 school districts take part in the walkout, including those in Oklahoma City and Tulsa The state Senate voted on three measures that affect education funding"}
{"original": "The Oklahoma Teachers Association will extend its five-day walkout into next week, group President Alicia Priest said Friday."}
{"original": "Before the walkout can end, the legislature must pass a bill ending the capital gains deduction and the governor must veto the repeal of a hotel-motel tax bill, Priest said at a news conference."}
{"original": "We will be here Monday and Tuesday to get this done, Priest said."}
{"original": "Friday was the fifth consecutive day Oklahoma teachers packed the state Capitol as lawmakers discussed three measures that affect education funding."}
{"original": "More than 55 of the state's 500-plus school districts – including those in Oklahoma City and Tulsa – were closed Friday because of the walkout, CNN affiliate KOCO reported."}
{"original": "Teachers pressured lawmakers on three bills that saw action."}
{"original": "1. The Senate approved a bill amendment Friday that would require third-party retailers selling though internet outlets such as Amazon to collect sales tax from customers or inform them how much they owe in sales taxes. The House approved it earlier in the week. The bill could bring in about $20 million annually in education funding."}
{"original": "2. The Senate approved a ball and dice tax for gambling Friday. Senate leaders are saying it will not add any income to this year's education funding but Priest, speaking at the news conference, said it would help."}
{"original": "3. The Senate followed the House's lead and repealed a hotel and motel tax as part of Bill 1010XX. This action removes around $43 million from the education funding bill. Senators claim that they can make up that shortage through other revenue in the bill."}
{"original": "It's still unclear whether the bills passed Friday helped teachers gain funding or covered only the education funding bill passed last week."}
{"original": "The Oklahoma Education Association says the motel tax, which it says would be paid by mostly nonresidents of the state, would add millions in revenue and opposes its repeal."}
{"original": "We strongly disagree with this repeal and are asking senators to vote no on the repeal of the hotel/motel tax, Katherine Bishop, the group's vice president, said in a Facebook message Thursday. This is a valuable revenue source that could provide much needed additional funding for our kids and is widely supported by the public."}
{"original": "The association wants the Senate to approve the first two measures – the third-party internet sales-tax collection bill and the ball and dice tax."}
{"original": "If those two pass, this would make a major victory for our students that would not have happened without the thousands of people who have come to the Capitol to make their voices heard, Bishop said. To be clear, this is why we are here, because we all want to do more for our students."}
{"original": "Teachers in Oklahoma say more spending on education is needed, asserting that school facilities, equipment and textbooks are rundown, outdated or in short supply."}
{"original": "The educators and state government are at odds over salaries and funding. Gov. Mary Fallin recently signed a bill that raises the average teacher salary by $6,100, but the teachers' union wanted that figure to be $10,000."}
{"original": "The state ranks 49th in the nation in teacher salaries, according to the National Education Association, in a list that includes Washington, D.C. Only Mississippi and South Dakota rank lower than Oklahoma."}
{"original": "Fallin also signed a bill that raises education funding – money for textbooks and the state-aid formula – next fiscal year by $50 million; the teachers' union wanted that number to be higher."}
{"original": "Since Monday, teachers have swarmed the Capitol with signs and slogans."}
{"original": "I think they thought we were not going to come out in the forces that we did, especially throughout the week … but we're holding strong, and you don't mess with teachers when we're trying to fight for our kids, Amanda Girdler, a fourth-grade teacher, told CNN."}
{"original": "The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation is investigating threats made against lawmakers they believe are related to the walkouts, according to Jessica Brown, a spokeswoman for the OSBI."}
{"original": "Brown declined to elaborate but did say investigators don't believe the threats are being made by teachers. At least three cases have been opened in the last two days."}
{"original": "In Kentucky, teachers also protested in their state Capitol earlier this week in Frankfort."}
{"original": "They are upset over a controversial pension bill that state lawmakers passed last week."}
{"original": "The bill would affect new teachers and move them to a hybrid cash-balance plan rather than traditional pensions, and would limit new sick days that teachers can put toward their retirement. Senate Bill 151 is now at Gov. Matt Bevin's desk. Supporters of the bill said the changes are necessary to save the state's pension systems."}
{"original": "CNNMoney: How states are changing teacher pension plans"}
{"original": "When teachers came to Frankfort on Monday to protest the pension overhaul, the state Legislature passed changes to the tax system called House Bill 366."}
{"original": "An analysis of that bill by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that the measure would bring a huge tax cut for the richest 1% of residents, while the biggest tax increase would affect those making less than $21,000 a year. A fellow with the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy described it as a tax cut for Kentucky's richest people paired with a tax increase for the middle class and the poor."}
{"original": "It's unclear whether Bevin will sign the bill."}
{"original": "CNN's Jason Hanna, Tina Burnside, Nick Valencia and Kaylee Hartung contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Checking and savings accounts are not the exclusive domain of banks. They are also offered by some non-bank businesses. Here are three of the most common:"}
{"original": "Credit unions operate much like banks, and deposits in member credit unions are federally insured up to $250,000 by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund."}
{"original": "The key difference is this: Credit unions are nonprofit, member-owned cooperatives whose members share something in common, such as a labor union, college alumni association, employer, or community. Members' immediate family may also be allowed to join."}

{"original": "JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) brought in more than $120 billion combined in profit last year, the result of President Donald Trump's corporate tax cuts and a booming economy."}
{"original": "That's a record showing. It also dwarfs the amount they made in 2017, when many banks faced large, one-time charges related to tax reform."}
{"original": "Those results highlight the degree to which bank shares have diverged from actual business performance. The sector's stocks had a dismal 2018, weighed down by concerns about rising interest rates, the shrinking difference between short-term and long-term bond yields, and global issues such as trade and Brexit."}
{"original": "But fears about slowing economic growth ahead take focus off what's happening right now: American banks are making more money than ever."}
{"original": "The largest players had mostly good news to share when they reported earnings for the final three months of 2018 this week."}
{"original": "One area that's being closely watched is how rising interest rates will affect banks."}
{"original": "Typically, higher rates let banks charge more interest on loans, while forcing them to grow what they pay out on deposits. But the spread between loan earnings and deposit costs was better than expected last quarter, according to Fred Cannon, director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods."}
{"original": "Deposit costs are rising, he said. But they didn't go up quite as much as people expected."}
{"original": "One dark spot was trading revenue. Global markets veered wildly in December. Instead of encouraging trading, this volatility appears to have spooked investors. Repeat sell-offs may have encouraged them to stay on the sidelines or cash out investments without making new ones."}
{"original": "Bond trading revenue suffered as a result. At JPMorgan, it fell 16%. At Goldman Sachs, which beat analyst expectations overall, trading revenue from the fixed income unit plunged 18%."}
{"original": "But bank executives brushed this off as a one-time problem, noting that January trading so far has been much more stable than December."}
{"original": "I honestly couldn't care less, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said Tuesday. He pointed to the company's strong performance in other areas, such as loans and credit cards."}
{"original": "Loan growth was generally solid, though Cannon pointed out this is not just about rising demand. He said market volatility played a role, and he encouraged banks to keep some loans on their balance sheets that would have otherwise been sold."}
{"original": "Despite healthy numbers overall, bank leaders clearly felt the need to reassure investors about the state of the economy. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have cut their growth forecasts for 2019, and concerns about a slowdown appear to be growing."}
{"original": "That matters for banks since profits are closely tied to the economy. They suffer when growth slows and businesses are scared to borrow, and become especially vulnerable when a recession hits and some customers aren't able to pay back loans."}
{"original": "Bank leaders said that while growth may slow, what they're seeing doesn't necessarily indicate near-term trouble."}
{"original": "From what we see, economic growth is stronger and more resilient than recent market volatility would indicate, Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said Monday."}
{"original": "Dimon took pains to note that even if a recession were to hit, it would look very different from the one that followed the 2008 financial crisis. Credit is pristine, he said during a Tuesday call for investors."}
{"original": "While some non-bank lenders could be in trouble, the quality of loans on JPMorgan's books is strong, Dimon added."}
{"original": "We're not immune to what goes on in the economy, Dimon said. But it won't be anything like you saw last time for much of the large banks."}
{"original": "One sticking point is the partial government shutdown, which could drag down economic growth in the first quarter of 2019 as it stretches into its 28th day."}
{"original": "The effects of the shutdown will hit banks eventually. The closure cramps lending and could even hurt capital markets activity by preventing companies from going public."}
{"original": "If the government shutdown continues, nobody's home at the [Securities and Exchange Commission] to approve IPOs, Cannon said."}

{"original": "Trump has said he will not release returns because tax authorities are auditing him."}
{"original": "And last month, Rubio and Cruz released summaries of their returns in order to highlight Trump's reluctance to reveal his own.

{"original": "Investors, who had been banking on gridlock in 2021, are suddenly worried about the risk of tax hikes and a crackdown on Big Tech, the superstar of the stock market. Tech stocks, and the market overall, could be hurt if a faster economic recovery allows the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates out of the basement sooner than anticipated."}

With Democrats in charge, GDP has grown at a brisk annual clip of 4.3% over that span -- the only scenario where growth eclipsed 4%."}
{"original": "Even though many would assume Republicans are better for the economy (low taxes, less regulation), GDP grew by a more modest 2.7% when Republicans had unified control of the government, according to CFRA."}

Since 1933, the S&P 500 has averaged 9.8% when Democrats have unified control, compared with 13.6% when there is a Democratic president and split Congress, according to CFRA."}
{"original": "It's important to remember that Democrats hardly have a super majority in Congress. They lost seats in the House of Representatives and the Senate could be tied 50/50, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris breaking the deadlock."}
{"original": "That means Democrats won't have enough votes to dramatically raise taxes, enact the Green New Deal or pass other sweeping measures that would rattle Wall Street -- unless they get rid of the Senate's filibuster rules, an idea that has gained some momentum in recent months but that moderate Democrat Joe Manchin opposes."}
{"original": "The most egregious or expensive policies will not be passed, Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday."}
{"original": "One big question mark is whether Democrats would try to hike the 21% corporate tax rate, especially in the midst of a shaky economic recovery."}

{"original": "However, investors are already worrying about the goldilocks backdrop that juiced stock prices."}
{"original": "Before this week, Wall Street was betting the Fed would keep interest rates at zero until at least 2024. Rock-bottom rates hurt savers and suggest economic weakness -- but they essentially force investors to gamble on risky stocks."}

{"original": "London (CNN Business) Nearly two decades have passed since a coronavirus known as SARS emerged in China, killing hundreds of people and sparking panic that sent a chill through the global economy. The virus now rampaging across China could be much more damaging ."}
{"original": "China has become an indispensable part of global business since the 2003 SARS outbreak. It's grown into the world's factory, churning out products such as the iPhone and driving demand for commodities like oil and copper. The country also boasts hundreds of millions of wealthy consumers who spend big on luxury products tourism and cars . China's economy accounted for roughly 4% of world GDP in 2003; it now makes up 16% of global output."}
{"original": "SARS sickened 8,098 people and killed 774 before it was contained. The new coronavirus, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has already killed more than 900 people and infected over 40,000 across at least 25countries and territories. Chinese officials have locked down Wuhan and several other cities, but the virus continues to spread."}
{"original": "The outbreak has the potential to cause severe economic and market dislocation. But the scale of the impact will ultimately be determined by how the virus spreads and evolves, which is almost impossible to predict, as well as how governments respond, said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics."}
{"original": "Compounding the risk is the fact that the world outside China has also changed since 2003."}
{"original": "Globalization has encouraged companies to build supply chains that cut across national borders, making economies much more interconnected. The major central banks have used up much of the ammunition they would typically deploy to fight economic downturns since the 2008 financial crisis, and global debt levels have never been higher. Rising nationalism may make it harder to coordinate a worldwide response, if that's required."}
{"original": "A resident wears a protective mask while riding a scooter on February 5, 2020, in Wuhan."}

According to S&P Global Ratings, the outbreak will force carmakers in China to slash production by about 15% in the first quarter. Toyota said on Friday it would keep its factories shut at least until February 17."}
{"original": "Burberry BBRYF Luxury goods makers, which rely on Chinese consumers who spend big at home and while on vacation, have also been hit. British brandhas closed 24 of its 64 stores in mainland China, and its chief executive warned Friday that the virus is causing a material negative effect on luxury demand. Dozens of global airlines have curtailed flights to and from China."}
{"original": "Qualcomm QCOM Hyundai HYMTF Fiat Chrysler FCAU Even more troubling is the threat to global supply chains., the world's biggest maker of smartphone chips, warned that the outbreak was causing significant uncertainty around demand for smartphones, and the supplies needed to produce them. Already, auto parts shortages have forcedto close plants in South Korea and causedto make contingency plans to avoid the same result at one of its plants in Europe."}
{"original": "Economists say the current level of disruption is manageable. If the number of new coronavirus cases begins to slow, and China's factories reopen soon, the result will be a fleeting hit to the Chinese economy in the first quarter and a dent in global growth. If the virus continues to spread, however, the economic damage will increase rapidly."}
{"original": "An employee works on an assembly line at Dongfeng Honda in Wuhan."}
{"original": "Allianz ALIZF Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to, told CNN Business that he was most worried about the potential cascading economic effects."}
{"original": "They first paralyze the region of the virus outbreak, he said. Then they gradually spread domestically, undermining internal trade, consumption, production and the movement of people. If the virus is still not contained, the process spreads further, including regionally and internationally by disrupting trade, supply chains and travel."}
{"original": "Economists have a hard time working out the potential costs of epidemics because of their unique characteristics."}
{"original": "Yet diseases can be far more damaging than natural disasters such as hurricanes or a tsunami, or other unpredictable events known as black swans. According to a study by the World Bank, a severe pandemic could cause economic losses equal to nearly 5% of global GDP, or more than $3 trillion. Losses from a weaker flu pandemic, such as the 2009 H1N1 virus, can still wipe 0.5% off global GDP."}
{"original": "A severe pandemic would resemble a global war in its sudden, profound, and widespread impact, the World Bank assessed in a report on pandemics from 2013. (The Wuhan coronavirus has not been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.)"}
{"original": "The virus is not the driving factor behind those losses, however. Instead, it's the way consumers, businesses and governments respond to an outbreak that matters most."}
{"original": "People are more likely to stay home during an outbreak to avoid getting sick, preventing them from traveling, shopping and working. Doing so limits demand for consumer goods and energy. Decisions by companies and governments to close shops and idle factories, meanwhile, curtail production."}
{"original": "This is continuing to grow in scope and magnitude. It could end being really, really big, and really, really serious. We can't project that now, said William Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who spent 15 years as president of the National Foreign Trade Council."}
{"original": "According to Shearing, past epidemics show that China's economy is likely to take a significant hit in the first quarter. But that will quickly fade from memory if the virus is contained."}
{"original": "As long as factory closures don't lead to job losses, by this time next year the level of GDP is unlikely to be very different from what it would have been without the virus, he said."}
{"original": "China's government has moved quickly to counter the economic fallout from the coronavirus and the measures taken to contain it."}
{"original": "The People's Bank of China cut a key interest rate this week and injected huge amounts of cash into markets in order to help take the pressure off banks and borrowers. Officials have also announced new tax breaks and subsidies designed to help consumers."}
{"original": "Yet China is also more vulnerable to a crisis than it was 17 years ago when SARS broke out."}
{"original": "It has much higher debt, trade tensions with a major trading partner and its growth has been steadily slowing down for a number of years, which gives a weak starting point to face such a crisis, said Raphie Hayat, a senior economist at Dutch bank Rabobank."}
{"original": "Analysts at Capital Economics expect the government to announce additional measures in the coming days. If the virus keeps spreading, they believe that Beijing will have to abandon its long-running efforts to get its debt under control and pump money directly into the economy."}
{"original": "Chinese President Xi Jinping attends a meeting in Beijing."}
{"original": "Central banks in neighboring countries including Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines have cut interest rates in recent weeks. South Korea and Taiwan could be next."}
{"original": "But the big powers of the financial world are exhausted from a decade fighting anemic growth since the global financial crisis. The European Central Bank introduced negative interest rates in 2014 and hasn't been able to increase them since, while the Bank of Japan is in a similar position. The US Federal Reserve already cut interest rates three times last year; Chair Jerome Powell has said he's carefully monitoring the situation."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, debt levels have soared in the United States, Japan and key European countries including Italy, limiting the scope for a big fiscal stimulus if the world economy goes into another tailspin. Global debt, including borrowing by households, governments and companies, has jumped to more than three times the size of the global economy, the highest ratio on record, according to the Institute of International Finance."}
{"original": "Also critical is whether governments are able to coordinate their response to the outbreak, ideally with help from multinational institutions. This is especially true because, according to the World Bank, preparedness for a potential pandemic is low. But coordination may prove difficult in a increasingly fractured world where nationalism is often prized over cooperation."}
{"original": "It's quite clear that multinational institutions are under more pressure, and have less teeth on day to day issues than 10 years ago, Shearing said. But the optimist in me would like to think that in the face of a global pandemic, global institutions are still in a position to respond."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- -- It's OK for Republicans to want President Obama to fail if they think he's jeopardizing the country, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal told members of his political party Tuesday night."}
{"original": "Gov. Bobby Jindal is offering a spirited defense of Republicans who say they want President Obama to fail."}
{"original": "Jindal described the premise of the question -- Do you want the president to fail? -- as the latest gotcha game being perpetrated by Democrats against Republicans."}
{"original": "Make no mistake: Anything other than an immediate and compliant, 'Why no sir, I don't want the president to fail,' is treated as some sort of act of treason, civil disobedience or political obstructionism, Jindal said at a political fundraiser attended by 1,200 people. This is political correctness run amok."}
{"original": "Since conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh said that he hoped that Obama would fail, Republicans have been pressed by Democrats and the media about Limbaugh's comments."}
{"original": "Jindal, a potential 2012 presidential candidate, told the Republican audience he would not be brow beaten on this, and I will not kowtow to their correctness."}
{"original": "My answer to the question is very simple: 'Do you want the president to fail?' It depends on what he is trying to do."}
{"original": "Jindal, who served two terms in the U.S. House, returned to Washington to help his former colleagues raise more than $6 million for the 2010 midterm elections. And he likely picked up important political chits, should he decide to run for president."}
{"original": "So far, Jindal has sidestepped questions about 2012. But on Tuesday he seemed to be laying the groundwork in case he eventually decides the political climate is right. A video of favorable back-to-back TV reports about Jindal preceded his introduction to the audience. And Jindal used his remarks to deep-pocketed Republican donors to emphasize his vision for how the Grand Old Party can get back on track."}
{"original": "He made a point to criticize Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for a spending spree that he said is costing the taxpayers more than the Iraq war, more than the Vietnam War, and, near and dear to my heart, even more than the Louisiana Purchase."}
{"original": "Jindal singled out House Republicans for standing up to Obama and helping the GOP return to its conservative roots."}
{"original": "The governor took a controversial stand when he refused to accept $98 million in federal stimulus money to expand unemployment benefits in Louisiana, because he said it would force an unfair tax on businesses when the funding ran out."}
{"original": "Democrats and other critics blasted Jindal's decision, saying he was influenced by presidential ambitions. But many conservatives saw his decision as a principled stand."}
{"original": "Moments after Jindal wrapped up his remarks Tuesday, Obama held his second prime-time news conference 12 blocks away at the White House. Last month, Jindal delivered the Republican response following Obama's joint address to Congress. The governor was widely panned for his performance, which he addressed Tuesday at the top of his speech."}
{"original": "Many of you have asked that I reprise my State of the Union response speech, Jindal said. That was a joke by the way. It's OK to laugh about it."}
{"original": "I have just learned that because of President Obama's opposition to torture, it is now illegal to show my speech to prisoners at Gitmo, he added."}
{"original": "The governor's speech then took on a serious tone when he emphasized the need for Republicans to put the 2008 election behind them and embrace the role of loyal opposition party."}
{"original": "It's time to declare our time of introspection and navel-gazing officially over, Jindal said. It's time to get on with the business of charting America's future. So, as of now, be it hereby resolved that we will focus on America's future, and on standing up for fiscal sanity, before it is too late."}
{"original": "With the next presidential election three years away and the fact that he has to face Louisiana voters in 2011 if he seeks re-election, it is not surprising that Jindal does not publicly express interest in running in 2012."}
{"original": "But if the governor is considering a presidential bid, he must now focus on learning to become a national candidate and building a political operation."}
{"original": "Unlike potential 2012 rivals such as Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee, Jindal doesn't have a national infrastructure in place, nor the experience the two men gained crisscrossing the country in their failed 2008 bids for the White House. And Jindal lacks the name recognition of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential nominee who is said to be considering her own campaign in 2012."}
{"original": "GOP operative Alex Vogel said it is critical for Jindal or any other Republican candidate to begin amassing a list of national supporters similar to what Obama created for the 2008 campaign."}
{"original": "It is all about data, said Vogel, a former senior aide to the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and ex-Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist. The best candidate in the world is only as good as his database. How many cell phone numbers, e-mails and mailing addresses can you collect? You can't collect that in a presidential campaign. You have to do that now."}
{"original": "Vogel also said that beyond fine-tuning his message, Jindal needs to continue giving speeches, attending political events and appearing on television if he wants to get used to running for national office."}
{"original": "At 37, Jindal potentially has a long political future, whether or not he runs for president in 2012."}
{"original": "There is plenty of time between now and the primaries for him to tighten his game, said Jonathan Grella, a GOP strategist who has worked for former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and the National Republican Senatorial Committee."}
{"original": "He obviously has got a long ways to go before he performs at a presidential level, and particularly at the Obama level. That is a tall order. But Bobby Jindal is an above-average political performer now, and he has plenty of room to grow."}

{"original": "A bit of travel is required to go here—driving or getting a taxi/Uber will be the easiest and fastest option—but, especially if it's a weekend, it's worth making the trip to Bukit Brown Cemetery. It's the largest Chinese cemetery outside of China, and it's a depository of history and heritage for Singapore. It's also home to a wide range of flora and fauna."}
{"original": "Most weekends, the Brownies, of the volunteer group All Things Bukit Brown, host free guided tours around the cemetery. (Check out their event page for more information.) There are introductory tours, which provide you with an overview of the culture and stories on offer in the cemetery, highlighting the tombs of notable figures and their contributions to Singapore. There are also themed tours that focus on more specific aspects of the site, such as the edible plants that grow in Bukit Brown."}
{"original": "Keep in mind, though, that Bukit Brown isn't quite what it used to be: More than 3,700 of over 100,000 graves have been exhumed to make way for an eight-lane highway that will cut the cemetery in half. The imminent change is why the Brownies' mission is so important and why I'm so insistent that Bukit Brown is worth the detour. As urbanization encroaches upon this historic and natural space, the need to learn, preserve, and understand its value has never been so urgent. Public awareness and care for Bukit Brown might one day be the only thing that stands between the cemetery and a top-down master plan to destroy it completely."}

The compound is open from 8 a.m., but the museum opens at 10 a.m., and free tours kick off at 11 a.m. Wander down Arab Street and stop at Toko Aljunied, a friendly store offering gorgeous Peranakan kebayas, batik sarongs, jewelry, and other trinkets."}

{"original": "Don't miss Mustafa Center, a 24-hour maze of a shopping mall, jam-packed with almost anything you can think of.

{"original": "My favorite exhibition is Siapa Nama Kamu?, meaning What Is Your Name? The show traces Singaporean art from the 19th century to the modern day. It's a beautiful way to follow the development and growth of the country and to see the region through the eyes of those who have called it home. Of particular interest is the section on the Nanyang Style, referring to a group of Chinese artists who were active in Malaya in the 1950s. Trained in both Chinese and Western traditions, these artists were inspired by Southeast Asian life; the Indonesian island of Bali, for instance, provided plenty of inspiration.

{"original": "Today Boat Quay is a series of pubs and restaurants, providing bankers and office workers a place to unwind and get tipsy at the end of the day. Pro tip: Don't eat at the seafood restaurants on Boat Quay. They are notorious for being ludicrously overpriced."}
{"original": "Boat Quay does, however, have one hidden gem: the Neko no Niwa Cat Café, situated on the second floor of a shophouse. More cat cafes have since opened, but Neko no Niwa is the country's very first.

(A note for parents: Children under the age of 7 aren't allowed in the cafe; children between 7 and 14 need adult supervision.)"}
{"original": "All of Neko no Niwa's 13 cats are rescue cats, in keeping with the establishment's desire to encourage people to adopt pets instead of buying them.

{"original": "The best time to visit Lau Pa Sat is in the evening. As the sun sets in Singapore at 7 p.m., the street behind the hawker center is closed off, and the satay vendors set up their stalls.

{"original": "(CNN) -- President Obama delivered his State of the Union address to Congress on Wednesday night. Here is a transcript of the speech."}
{"original": "Obama: Madam Speaker, Vice President Biden, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans, our Constitution declares that from time to time the president shall give to Congress information about the state of our union. For 220 years, our leaders have fulfilled this duty. They've done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility, and they've done so in the midst of war and depression, at moments of great strife and great struggle."}
{"original": "It's tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress was inevitable, that America was always destined to succeed."}
{"original": "But when the Union was turned back at Bull Run and the Allies first landed at Omaha Beach, victory was very much in doubt. When the market crashed on Black Tuesday and civil rights marchers were beaten on Bloody Sunday, the future was anything but certain."}
{"original": "These were the times that tested the courage of our convictions and the strength of our union. And despite all our divisions and disagreements, our hesitations and our fears, America prevailed because we chose to move forward as one nation, as one people."}
{"original": "Again, we are tested. And again, we must answer history's call."}
{"original": "One year ago, I took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by a severe recession, a financial system on the verge of collapse, and a government deeply in debt. Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act, we might face a second depression."}
{"original": "So we acted, immediately and aggressively. And one year later, the worst of the storm has passed."}
{"original": "But the devastation remains: One in 10 Americans still can't find work. Many businesses have shuttered. Home values have declined. Small towns and rural communities have been hit especially hard. And for those who'd already known poverty, life has become that much harder."}
{"original": "This recession has also compounded the burdens that America's families have been dealing with for decades, the burden of working harder and longer for less, of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college."}
{"original": "So I know the anxieties that are out there right now. They're not new. These struggles are the reason I ran for president. These struggles are what I've witnessed for years in places like Elkhart, Indiana, Galesburg, Illinois."}
{"original": "I hear about them in the letters that I read each night. The toughest to read are those written by children, asking why they have to move from their home, asking when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work."}
{"original": "For these Americans and so many others, change has not come fast enough. Some are frustrated; some are angry. They don't understand why it seems like bad behavior on Wall Street is rewarded, but hard work on Main Street isn't, or why Washington has been unable or unwilling to solve any of our problems."}
{"original": "They're tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness. They know we can't afford it, not now."}
{"original": "So we face big and difficult challenges. And what the American people hope -- what they deserve -- is for all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to work through our differences, to overcome the numbing weight of our politics, for while the people who sent us here have different backgrounds, different stories, different beliefs, the anxieties they face are the same, the aspirations they hold are shared: a job that pays the bills, a chance to get ahead, most of all, the ability to give their children a better life."}
{"original": "You know what else they share? They share a stubborn resilience in the face of adversity. After one of the most difficult years in our history, they remain busy building cars and teaching kids, starting businesses and going back to school. They're coaching Little League and helping their neighbors."}
{"original": "One woman wrote to me and said, We are strained but hopeful, struggling but encouraged."}
{"original": "It's because of this spirit -- this great decency and great strength -- that I have never been more hopeful about America's future than I am tonight."}
{"original": "Despite -- despite our hardships, our union is strong. We do not give up. We do not quit. We do not allow fear or division to break our spirit. In this new decade, it's time the American people get a government that matches their decency, that embodies their strength."}
{"original": "And tonight -- tonight, I'd like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise."}
{"original": "Our most urgent -- our most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis. It was not easy to do. And if there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans -- and everybody in between -- it's that we all hated the bank bailout. I hated it."}
{"original": "I hated it. I hated it. You hated it. It was about as popular as a root canal."}
{"original": "But when I ran for president, I promised I wouldn't just do what was popular, I would do what was necessary. And if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system, unemployment might be double what it is today. More businesses would certainly have closed; more homes would have surely been lost."}
{"original": "So I supported the last administration's efforts to create the financial rescue program. And when we took that program over, we made it more transparent and more accountable. And as a result, the markets are now stabilized, and we've recovered most of the money we spent on the banks."}
{"original": "Most, but not all. To recover the rest, I've proposed a fee on the biggest banks. Now..."}
{"original": "Now, I know Wall Street isn't keen on this idea, but if these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses again, they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need."}
{"original": "Now, as we stabilized the financial system, we also took steps to get our economy growing again, save as many jobs as possible, and help Americans who'd become unemployed."}
{"original": "That's why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million Americans, made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their coverage through COBRA, and passed 25 different tax cuts."}
{"original": "Now, let me repeat: We cut taxes. We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. We cut taxes for small businesses."}
{"original": "We cut taxes for first-time homebuyers. We cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children. We cut taxes for 8 million Americans paying for college."}
{"original": "I thought I'd get some applause on that one."}
{"original": "As a result, millions of Americans had more to spend on gas and food and other necessities, all of which helped businesses keep more workers. And we haven't raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person, not a single dime."}
{"original": "Now, because of the steps we took, there are about 2 million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed."}
{"original": "Two-hundred-thousand work in construction and clean energy. Three-hundred-thousand are teachers and other education workers. Tens of thousands are cops, firefighters, correctional officers, first responders."}
{"original": "And we're on track to add another 1.5 million jobs to this total by the end of the year."}
{"original": "The plan that has made all of this possible, from the tax cuts to the jobs, is the Recovery Act."}
{"original": "That's right, the Recovery Act, also known as the stimulus bill."}
{"original": "Economists on the left and the right say this bill has helped saved jobs and avert disaster, but you don't have to take their word for it."}
{"original": "Talk to the small business in Phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the Recovery Act."}
{"original": "Talk to the window manufacturer in Philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical about the Recovery Act, until he had to add two more work shifts just because of the business it created."}
{"original": "Talk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the last week of school that, because of the Recovery Act, she wouldn't be laid off after all."}
{"original": "There are stories like this all across America. And after two years of recession, the economy is growing again. Retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value. Businesses are beginning to invest again, and slowly, some are starting to hire again."}
{"original": "But I realize that, for every success story, there are other stories, of men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from, who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response."}
{"original": "That is why jobs must be our No. 1 focus in 2010, and that's why I'm calling for a new jobs bill tonight."}
{"original": "Now, the true engine of job creation in this country will always be America's businesses..."}
{"original": "... but government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire more workers."}
{"original": "We should start where most new jobs do, in small businesses, companies that begin when..."}
{"original": "... companies that begin when an entrepreneur -- when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream or a worker decides it's time she became her own boss."}
{"original": "Through sheer grit and determination, these companies have weathered the recession and are ready to grow. But when you talk to small-business owners in places like Allentown, Pennsylvania, or Elyria, Ohio, you find out that even though banks on Wall Street are lending again, they're mostly lending to bigger companies. Financing remains difficult for small-business owners across the country, even though they're making a profit."}
{"original": "So tonight, I'm proposing that we take $30 billion of the money Wall Street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat."}
{"original": "I'm also proposing a new small-business tax credit, one that will go to over 1 million small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages."}
{"original": "While we're at it, let's also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small-business investment and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all small businesses to invest in new plants and equipment."}
{"original": "Next, we can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow."}
{"original": "From -- from the first railroads to the Interstate Highway System, our nation has always been built to compete. There's no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains or the new factories that manufacture clean-energy products."}
{"original": "Tomorrow, I'll visit Tampa, Florida, where workers will soon break ground on a new high-speed railroad funded by the Recovery Act. There are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help move our nation's goods, services and information."}
{"original": "We should put more Americans to work building clean-energy facilities and give..."}
{"original": "... and give rebates to Americans who make their homes more energy efficient, which supports clean-energy jobs."}
{"original": "And to encourage these and other businesses to stay within our borders, it is time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in the United States of America."}
{"original": "Now, the House has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps."}
{"original": "As the first order of business this year, I urge the Senate to do the same, and I know they will. They will."}
{"original": "People are out of work. They're hurting. They need our help. And I want a jobs bill on my desk without delay."}
{"original": "But -- but the truth is, these steps won't make up for the 7 million jobs that we've lost over the last two years. The only way to move to full employment is to lay a new foundation for long- term economic growth and finally address the problems that America's families have confronted for years."}
{"original": "We can't afford another so-called economic expansion like the one from last decade, what some call the lost decade, where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion, where the income of the average American household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs, where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation."}
{"original": "From the day I took office, I've been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious, such effort would be too contentious. I've been told that our political system is too gridlocked and that we should just put things on hold for a while."}
{"original": "For those who make these claims, I have one simple question: How long should we wait? How long should America put its future on hold? You see..."}
{"original": "You see, Washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the problems have grown worse. Meanwhile, China's not waiting to revamp its economy; Germany's not waiting; India's not waiting."}
{"original": "These nations, they're not standing still. These nations aren't playing for second place. They're putting more emphasis on math and science. They're rebuilding their infrastructure. They're making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs."}
{"original": "Well, I do not accept second place for the United States of America."}
{"original": "As hard as it may be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become, it's time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth."}
{"original": "Now, one place to start is serious financial reform. Look, I'm not interested in punishing banks. I'm interested in protecting our economy. A strong, healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs. It channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes. But that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy."}
{"original": "We need to make sure consumers and middle-class families have the information they need to make financial decisions. We can't allow financial institutions, including those that take your deposits, to take risks that threaten the whole economy."}
{"original": "Now, the House has already passed financial reform with many of these changes. And -- and the lobbyists are trying to kill it. Well, we cannot let them win this fight. And if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform, I will send it back until we get it right. We've got to get it right."}
{"original": "Next, we need to encourage American innovation. Last year, we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history, an investment -- an investment that could lead to the world's cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched."}
{"original": "And no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy. You can see the results of last year's investments in clean energy in the North Carolina company that will create 1,200 jobs nationwide, helping to make advanced batteries, or in the California business that will put 1,000 people to work making solar panels."}
{"original": "But to create more of these clean-energy jobs, we need more production, more efficiency, more incentives, and that means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country."}
{"original": "It means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development."}
{"original": "It means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean-coal technologies."}
{"original": "And, yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America."}
{"original": "I'm grateful to the House for passing such a bill last year."}
{"original": "And this year -- this year, I'm eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate."}
{"original": "I know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy. I know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change."}
{"original": "But -- but here's the thing. Even if you doubt the evidence, providing incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future, because the nation that leads the clean-energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy, and America must be that nation."}
{"original": "Third, we need to export more of our goods."}
{"original": "Because the more products we make and sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right here in America. So..."}
{"original": "So tonight, we set a new goal: We will double our exports over the next five years, an increase that will support 2 million jobs in America."}
{"original": "To help meet this goal, we're launching a National Export Initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports and reform export controls consistent with national security."}
{"original": "We have to seek new markets aggressively, just as our competitors are. If America sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals, we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores."}
{"original": "But realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the rules."}
{"original": "And that's why we'll continue to shape a Doha trade agreement that opens global markets and why we will strengthen our trade relations in Asia and with key partners like South Korea, and Panama, and Colombia."}
{"original": "Fourth, we need to invest in the skills and education of our people. Now, this year -- this year, we've broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools."}
{"original": "And the idea here is simple: Instead of rewarding failure, we only reward success. Instead of funding the status quo, we only invest in reform, reform that raises student achievement, inspires students to excel in math and science, and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young Americans, from rural communities to the inner city."}
{"original": "In the 21st century, the best anti-poverty program around is a world-class education."}
{"original": "And in this country, the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than on their potential. When we renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will work with Congress to expand these reforms to all 50 states."}
{"original": "Still, in this economy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job. That's why I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges, which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families."}
{"original": "To make college more affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans. Instead, let's take that money and give families a $10,000 tax credit for four years of college and increase Pell Grants."}
{"original": "And let's tell another 1 million students that, when they graduate, they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans, and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 years, and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service, because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they chose to go to college."}
{"original": "And, by the way, it's time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs, because they, too, have a responsibility to help solve this problem."}
{"original": "Now, the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle class. That's why last year I asked Vice President Biden to chair a task force on middle-class families."}
{"original": "That's why we're nearly doubling the childcare tax credit and making it easier to save for retirement by giving access to every worker a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg. That's why we're working to lift the value of a family's single largest investment, their home."}
{"original": "The steps we took last year to shore up the housing market have allowed millions of Americans to take out new loans and save an average of $1,500 on mortgage payments. This year, we will step up refinancing so that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages. And..."}
{"original": "And it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle-class families that we still need health insurance reform."}
{"original": "Now, let's clear a few things up."}
{"original": "I didn't choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt. And by now, it should be fairly obvious that I didn't take on health care because it was good politics."}
{"original": "I took on health care because of the stories I've heard, from Americans with pre-existing conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage, patients who've been denied coverage, families, even those with insurance, who are just one illness away from financial ruin."}
{"original": "After nearly a century of trying -- Democratic administrations, Republican administrations -- we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many Americans."}
{"original": "The approach we've taken would protect every American from the worst practices of the insurance industry. It would give small businesses and uninsured Americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market."}
{"original": "It would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care. And by the way, I want to acknowledge our first lady, Michelle Obama, who this year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make kids healthier."}
{"original": "Our approach would preserve the right of Americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan. It would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses."}
{"original": "And according to the Congressional Budget Office, the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for Congress, our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades."}
{"original": "Still, this is a complex issue. And the longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became. I take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the American people. And I know that with all the lobbying and horse-trading, this process left most Americans wondering, What's in it for me?"}
{"original": "But I also know this problem is not going away. By the time I'm finished speaking tonight, more Americans will have lost their health insurance. Millions will lose it this year. Our deficit will grow. Premiums will go up. Patients will be denied the care they need. Small-business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether."}
{"original": "I will not walk away from these Americans, and neither should the people in this chamber."}
{"original": "As temperatures cool, I want everyone to take another look at the plan we've proposed. There's a reason why many doctors, nurses and health care experts who know our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo."}
{"original": "But if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen Medicare for seniors, and stop insurance company abuses, let me know."}
{"original": "Let me know. Let me know."}
{"original": "Here's what I ask Congress, though: Don't walk away from reform, not now, not when we are so close. Let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the American people. Let's get it done."}
{"original": "Now, even as health care reform would reduce our deficit, it's not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves. It's a challenge that makes all others that much harder to solve and one that's been subject to a lot of political posturing."}
{"original": "So let me start the discussion of government spending by setting the record straight. At the beginning of the last decade, the year 2000, America had a budget surplus of over $200 billion."}
{"original": "By -- by the time I took office, we had a one-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade. Most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription drug program."}
{"original": "On top of that, the effects of the recession put a $3 trillion hole in our budget. All this was before I walked in the door."}
{"original": "Now -- just stating the facts. Now, if we had taken office in ordinary times, I would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit. But we took office amid a crisis, and our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another $1 trillion to our national debt. That, too, is a fact."}
{"original": "I'm absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do, but families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions. The federal government should do the same."}
{"original": "So tonight, I'm proposing specific steps to pay for the $1 trillion that it took to rescue the economy last year."}
{"original": "Starting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze government spending for three years. Spending related to our national security, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security will not be affected, but all other discretionary government programs will."}
{"original": "Like any cash-strapped family, we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don't. And if I have to enforce this discipline by veto, I will."}
{"original": "We will continue to go through the budget line by line, page by page, to eliminate programs that we can't afford and don't work. We've already identified $20 billion in savings for next year."}
{"original": "To help working families, we'll extend our middle-class tax cuts. But at a time of record deficits, we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies, for investment fund managers, and for those making over $250,000 a year. We just can't afford it."}
{"original": "Now, even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we'll still face the massive deficit we had when I took office. More importantly, the cost of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will continue to skyrocket."}
{"original": "That's why I've called for a bipartisan Fiscal Commission, modeled on a proposal by Republican Judd Gregg and Democrat Kent Conrad."}
{"original": "This can't be one of those Washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solved a problem. The commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain deadline."}
{"original": "Now, yesterday, the Senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission. So I'll issue an executive order that will allow us to go forward, because I refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of Americans."}
{"original": "And when the vote comes tomorrow, the Senate should restore the pay-as-you-go law that was a big reason for why we had record surpluses in the 1990s."}
{"original": "Now, I know that some in my own party will argue that we can't address the deficit or freeze government spending when so many are still hurting. And I agree, which is why this freeze won't take effect until next year, when the economy is stronger. That's how budgeting works."}
{"original": "But understand -- understand, if we don't take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery, all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes."}
{"original": "From some on the right, I expect we'll hear a different argument, that if we just make fewer investments in our people, extend tax cuts, including those for the wealthier Americans, eliminate more regulations, maintain the status quo on health care, our deficits will go away."}
{"original": "The problem is, that's what we did for eight years."}
{"original": "That's what helped us into this crisis. It's what helped lead to these deficits. We can't do it again."}
{"original": "Rather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated Washington for decades, it's time to try something new. Let's invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of debt. Let's meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here. Let's try common sense, a novel concept."}
{"original": "Now, to do that, we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now. We face a deficit of trust, deep and corrosive doubts about how Washington works that have been growing for years."}
{"original": "To close that credibility gap, we have to take action on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, to end the outsized influence of lobbyists, to do our work openly, to give our people the government they deserve."}
{"original": "That's what I came to Washington to do. That's why, for the first time in history, my administration posts our White House visitors online. That's why we've excluded lobbyists from policy-making jobs or seats on federal boards and commissions."}
{"original": "But we can't stop there. It's time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client with my administration or with Congress. It's time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for federal office."}
{"original": "With all due deference to separation of powers, last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections."}
{"original": "I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests or, worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people. And I urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps correct some of these problems."}
{"original": "I'm also calling on Congress to continue down the path of earmark reform, Democrats and Republicans."}
{"original": "Democrats and Republicans, you've trimmed some of this spending. You've embraced some meaningful change, but restoring the public trust demands more. For example, some members of Congress post some earmark requests online."}
{"original": "Tonight, I'm calling on Congress to publish all earmark requests on a single Web site before there's a vote so that the American people can see how their money is being spent."}
{"original": "Of course, none of these reforms will even happen if we don't also reform how we work with one another. Now, I'm not naive. I never thought that the mere fact of my election would usher in peace and harmony and some post-partisan era."}
{"original": "I knew that both parties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched. And on some issues, there are simply philosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways. These disagreements, about the role of government in our lives, about our national priorities and our national security, they've been taking place for over 200 years. They're the very essence of our democracy."}
{"original": "But what frustrates the American people is a Washington where every day is Election Day. We can't wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side, a belief that if you lose, I win. Neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can."}
{"original": "I'm speaking of both parties now. The confirmation of well-qualified public servants shouldn't be held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few individual senators."}
{"original": "Washington may think that saying anything about the other side, no matter how false, no matter how malicious, is just part of the game. But it's precisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the American people. Worse yet -- worse yet, it's sowing further division among our citizens, further distrust in our government."}
{"original": "So, no, I will not give up on trying to change the tone of our politics. I know it's an election year. And after last week, it's clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual. But we still need to govern."}
{"original": "To Democrats, I would remind you that we still have the largest majority in decades and the people expect us to solve problems, not run for the hills."}
{"original": "And if the Republican leadership is going to insist that 60 votes in the Senate are required to do any business at all in this town, a supermajority, then the responsibility to govern is now yours, as well. Just saying no to everything may be good short-term politics, but it's not leadership. We were sent here to serve our citizens, not our ambitions."}
{"original": "So let's show the American people that we can do it together."}
{"original": "This week -- this week, I'll be addressing a meeting of the House Republicans. I'd like to begin monthly meetings with both Democratic and Republican leadership. I know you can't wait."}
{"original": "Now, throughout our history, no issue has united this country more than our security. Sadly, some of the unity we felt after 9/11 has dissipated. And we can argue all we want about who's to blame for this, but I'm not interested in re-litigating the past."}
{"original": "I know that all of us love this country. All of us are committed to its defense. So let's put aside the schoolyard taunts about who's tough. Let's reject the false choice between protecting our people and upholding our values. Let's leave behind the fear and division and do what it takes to defend our nation and forge a more hopeful future, for America and for the world."}
{"original": "That's the work we began last year. Since the day I took office, we renewed our focus on the terrorists who threaten our nation. We've made substantial investments in our homeland security and disrupted plots that threatened to take American lives."}
{"original": "We are filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed Christmas attack with better airline security and swifter action on our intelligence. We've prohibited torture and strengthened partnerships from the Pacific to South Asia to the Arabian Peninsula."}
{"original": "And in the last year, hundreds of Al Qaeda's fighters and affiliates, including many senior leaders, have been captured or killed, far more than in 2008."}
{"original": "And in Afghanistan, we're increasing our troops and training Afghan security forces so they can begin to take the lead in July of 2011 and our troops can begin to come home."}
{"original": "We will reward good governance, work to reduce corruption, and support the rights of all Afghans, men and women alike. We're joined by allies and partners who have increased their own commitment and who'll come together tomorrow in London to reaffirm our common purpose. There will be difficult days ahead, but I am absolutely confident we will succeed."}
{"original": "As we take the fight to Al Qaeda, we are responsibly leaving Iraq to its people. As a candidate, I promised that I would end this war, and that is what I am doing as president."}
{"original": "We will have all of our combat troops out of Iraq by the end of this August."}
{"original": "We will support -- we will support the Iraqi government -- we will support the Iraqi government as they hold elections, and we will continue to partner with the Iraqi people to promote regional peace and prosperity."}
{"original": "But make no mistake: This war is ending, and all of our troops are coming home."}
{"original": "Tonight, all of our men and women in uniform -- in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and around the world -- they have to know that we -- that they have our respect, our gratitude, our full support. And just as they must have the resources they need in war, we all have a responsibility to support them when they come home."}
{"original": "That's why we made the largest increase in investments for veterans in decades last year."}
{"original": "That's why we're building a 21st-century [Veterans Affairs]. And that's why Michelle has joined with Jill Biden to forge a national commitment to support military families."}
{"original": "Now, even as we prosecute two wars, we're also confronting perhaps the greatest danger to the American people, the threat of nuclear weapons. I've embraced the vision of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these weapons and seeks a world without them."}
{"original": "To reduce our stockpiles and launchers, while ensuring our deterrent, the United States and Russia are completing negotiations on the farthest-reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades."}
{"original": "And at April's Nuclear Security Summit, we will bring 44 nations together here in Washington, D.C., behind a clear goal: securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in four years so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists."}
{"original": "Now, these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of nuclear weapons. That's why North Korea now faces increased isolation and stronger sanctions, sanctions that are being vigorously enforced."}
{"original": "That's why the international community is more united and the Islamic Republic of Iran is more isolated. And as Iran's leaders continue to ignore their obligations, there should be no doubt: They, too, will face growing consequences. That is a promise."}
{"original": "That's the leadership we are providing: engagement that advances the common security and prosperity of all people. We're working through the G-20 to sustain a lasting global recovery. We're working with Muslim communities around the world to promote science and education and innovation."}
{"original": "We have gone from a bystander to a leader in the fight against climate change. We're helping developing countries to feed themselves and continuing the fight against HIV/AIDS."}
{"original": "And we are launching a new initiative that will give us the capacity to respond faster and more effectively to bioterrorism or an infectious disease, a plan that will counter threats at home and strengthen public health abroad."}
{"original": "As we have for over 60 years, America takes these actions because our destiny is connected to those beyond our shores. But we also do it because it is right."}
{"original": "That's why, as we meet here tonight, over 10,000 Americans are working with many nations to help the people of Haiti recover and rebuild."}
{"original": "That's why we stand with the girl who yearns to go to school in Afghanistan, why we support the human rights of the women marching through the streets of Iran, why we advocate for the young man denied a job by corruption in Guinea, for America must always stand on the side of freedom and human dignity, always."}
{"original": "Abroad, America's greatest source of strength has always been our ideals. The same is true at home. We find unity in our incredible diversity, drawing on the promise enshrined in our Constitution, the notion that we're all created equal, that no matter who you are or what you look like, if you abide by the law, you should be protected by it, if you adhere to our common values, you should be treated no different than anyone else."}
{"original": "We must continually renew this promise. My administration has a Civil Rights Division that is once again prosecuting civil rights violations and employment discrimination. We finally strengthened..."}
{"original": "We finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by hate."}
{"original": "This year -- this year, I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are. It's the right thing to do."}
{"original": "We're going to crack down on violations of equal pay laws, so that women get equal pay for an equal day's work."}
{"original": "And we should continue the work of fixing our broken immigration system, to secure our borders, and enforce our laws, and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our nations."}
{"original": "In the end, it's our ideals, our values that built America, values that allowed us to forge a nation made up of immigrants from every corner of the globe, values that drive our citizens still."}
{"original": "Every day, Americans meet their responsibilities to their families and their employers. Time and again, they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their country. They take pride in their labor and are generous in spirit."}
{"original": "These aren't Republican values or Democratic values that they're living by, business values or labor values. They're American values."}
{"original": "Unfortunately, too many of our citizens have lost faith that our biggest institutions -- our corporations, our media, and, yes, our government -- still reflect these same values."}
{"original": "Each of these institutions are full of honorable men and women doing important work that helps our country prosper. But each time a CEO rewards himself for failure or a banker puts the rest of us at risk for his own selfish gain, people's doubts grow. Each time lobbyists game the system or politicians tear each other down instead of lifting this country up, we lose faith."}
{"original": "The more that TV pundits reduce serious debates to silly arguments, big issues into sound bites, our citizens turn away."}
{"original": "No wonder there's so much cynicism out there. No wonder there's so much disappointment."}
{"original": "I campaigned on the promise of change, change we can believe in, the slogan went. And right now, I know there are many Americans who aren't sure if they still believe we can change, or that I can deliver it."}
{"original": "But remember this: I never suggested that change would be easy or that I could do it alone. Democracy in a nation of 300 million people can be noisy and messy and complicated. And when you try to do big things and make big changes, it stirs passions and controversy. That's just how it is."}
{"original": "Those of us in public office can respond to this reality by playing it safe and avoid telling hard truths and pointing fingers. We can do what's necessary to keep our poll numbers high and get through the next election instead of doing what's best for the next generation."}
{"original": "But I also know this: If people had made that decision 50 years ago or 100 years ago or 200 years ago, we wouldn't be here tonight. The only reason we are here is because generations of Americans were unafraid to do what was hard, to do what was needed even when success was uncertain, to do what it took to keep the dream of this nation alive for their children and their grandchildren."}
{"original": "Our administration has had some political setbacks this year, and some of them were deserved. But I wake up every day knowing that they are nothing compared to the setbacks that families all across this country have faced this year."}
{"original": "And what keeps me going, what keeps me fighting, is that despite all these setbacks, that spirit of determination and optimism, that fundamental decency that has always been at the core of the American people, that lives on."}
{"original": "It lives on in the struggling small-business owner who wrote to me of his company, None of us, he said, are willing to consider, even slightly, that we might fail."}
{"original": "It lives on in the woman who said that, even though she and her neighbors have felt the pain of recession, We are strong, we are resilient, we are American."}
{"original": "It lives on in the 8-year-old boy in Louisiana who just sent me his allowance and asked if I would give it to the people of Haiti."}
{"original": "And it lives on in all the Americans who've dropped everything to go someplace they've never been and pull people they've never known from the rubble, prompting chants of USA! USA! USA! when another life was saved."}
{"original": "The spirit that has sustained this nation for more than two centuries lives on in you, its people."}
{"original": "We have finished a difficult year. We have come through a difficult decade. But a new year has come. A new decade stretches before us."}
{"original": "We don't quit. I don't quit. Let's seize this moment, to start anew, to carry the dream forward, and to strengthen our union once more."}
{"original": "Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America."}
{"original": "Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the first lady of the United States and my fellow citizens, three years ago we launched the great American comeback."}
{"original": "A key element to the Trump narrative is that America was bad before he came along. And it's great now."}
{"original": "Tonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results. Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again! America's enemies are on the run, America's fortunes are on the rise, and America's future is blazing bright."}
{"original": "The story Trump can tell is about the economy. But as with everything, he uses hyperbole. Incomes are up. But soaring'? Poverty is still a major issue. In his telling, it is plummeting. He is the ultimate salesman."}
{"original": "The years of economic decay are over. The days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us. Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige."}
{"original": "It's important to note that the economy has been expanding for a decade, starting under President Barack Obama. And the rate of growth is not any greater for Trump. But in his telling, he is to thank for it all. More jobs were created in the end of Obama's last term than in the beginning of Trump's. But he doesn't provide that nuance."}
{"original": "In just 3 short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline, and we have rejected the downsizing of America's destiny. We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never going back!"}
{"original": "I am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been. Our military is completely rebuilt, with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world – and it is not even close. Our borders are secure. Our families are flourishing. Our values are renewed. Our pride is restored. And for all these reasons, I say to the people of our great country, and to the Members of Congress before me: The State of our Union is stronger than ever before!"}
{"original": "It is impossible to keep track of his overstatements. The economy is the best it's ever been? The US has had the largest military in the world for decades. The borders are secure? Then why is there a national emergency to build a wall there?"}
{"original": "The vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world's most prosperous and inclusive society – one where every citizen can join in America's unparalleled success, and where every community can take part in America's extraordinary rise."}
{"original": "Trump argues that he is building the most inclusive society in the world. But he has repeatedly said nice things about white nationalists and he has made the guiding principle of his political career to keep immigrants out of the country."}
{"original": "From the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the United States economy – slashing a record number of job-killing regulations, enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements. Our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth, and, most of all, pro-American. We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting high our citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed."}
{"original": "Again, it's debatable that the economy needed reviving when he took office. It's been growing for more than a decade. He did move to cut many regulations — but there are serious environmental impacts for those moves. Further, that tax cut bill, which permanently cut corporate rates and temporarily cut individual rates, has made the national deficit skyrocket to more than $1 trillion per year. The national debt goes unmentioned in this speech, which is an incredible thing for a Republican president."}
{"original": "Since my election, we have created 7 million new jobs – 5 million more than Government experts projected during the previous administration."}
{"original": "The unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century."}
{"original": "Trump is correct. Between November 2016, the month of his election, and December 2019, the last month for which we have data, the economy added 7.3 million jobs. Read more"}
{"original": "Incredibly, the average unemployment rate under my Administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country. If we had not reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witness to America's great economic success."}
{"original": "This is a difficult claim to make since the unemployment rate has been generally headed down for more than a decade, since the Great Recession."}
{"original": "The unemployment rates for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans have reached the lowest levels in history. African-American youth unemployment has reached an all-time low."}
{"original": "Trump is correct. The unemployment rate for each of these three groups is at a record low, at least since the government has been issuing data on them. Read more"}
{"original": "African-American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded."}
{"original": "The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years – and last year, women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added."}
{"original": "The veterans' unemployment rate dropped to a record low."}
{"original": "The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low."}
{"original": "The unemployment rate for Americans with disabilities is lower than at any point in the Obama administration, but it did go up from 6.1 percent in September of last year to 7 percent in December. In addition, describing this as an all-time low obscures the fact that the government has only tracked this data since 2008. Read more"}
{"original": "Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in United States history."}
{"original": "A record number of young Americans are now employed."}
{"original": "Under the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls. Under my Administration, 7 million Americans have come off of food stamps, and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare."}
{"original": "The atmosphere is very tense. Democrats aren't applauding. As Trump boasted about welfare stats, Democrats were heard objecting. Republicans howled in support."}
{"original": "In 8 years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age people dropped out of the workforce. In just 3 years of my Administration, 3.5 million working-age people have joined the workforce."}
{"original": "Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage-earners has increased by 47 percent – 3 times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent. After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast – and, wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers, who have seen a 16 percent pay-increase since my election. This is a blue collar boom."}
{"original": "It's interesting that he makes this argument since the problem of income inequality is a major issue that Democratic presidential candidates are trying to address. Income inequality is a fact of American life. Look at the trends here."}
{"original": "Real median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded!"}
{"original": "Since my election, United States stock markets have soared 70 percent, adding more than $12 trillion to our Nation's wealth, transcending anything anyone believed was possible – this, as other countries are not doing well. Consumer confidence has reached amazing new heights."}
{"original": "All of those millions of people with 401(k)s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60, 70, 80, 90, and even 100 percent."}
{"original": "Jobs and investment are pouring into 9,000 previously-neglected neighborhoods thanks to Opportunity Zones, a plan spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott as part of our great Republican tax cuts. In other words, wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that have not seen investment in many decades, creating jobs, energy, and excitement. This is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this. It is all working!"}
{"original": "Opportunity zones also created a mind boggling tax break and, somehow, have been exploited to help gentrifying areas. A firm with ties to Jared Kushner specializes in soliciting investments in them. Meet the CEO here."}
{"original": "Opportunity Zones are helping Americans like Army Veteran Tony Rankins from Cincinnati, Ohio. After struggling with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, his house, and his family – he was homeless. But then Tony found a construction company that invests in Opportunity Zones. He is now a top tradesman, drug-free, reunited with his family, and he is here tonight. Tony: Keep up the great work."}
{"original": "Our roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start. This second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark Criminal Justice Reform into law. Everybody said that Criminal Justice Reform could not be done, but I got it done, and the people in this room got it done."}
{"original": "Thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world, by far. With the tremendous progress we have made over the past 3 years, America is now energy independent, and energy jobs, like so many elements of our country, are at a record high. We are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just 3 years ago."}
{"original": "The US did not become the world's top energy producer under Trump: It took the top spot under the Obama administration in 2012, according to the US government's Energy Information Administration. Read more"}
{"original": "Likewise, we are restoring our Nation's manufacturing might, even though predictions were that this could never be done. After losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my Administration with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or built. We have created over half a million new manufacturing jobs. Companies are not leaving; they are coming back. Everybody wants to be where the action is, and the United States of America is, indeed, where the action is."}
{"original": "Both figures are correct, though it's worth noting that the numbers include both large traditional factories and tiny facilities that produce goods with fewer than five employees. Read more"}
{"original": "One of the single biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal. In fact, unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for President. Following NAFTA's adoption, our Nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs. Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA – only to do absolutely nothing. But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises. Six days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed the brand new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law."}
{"original": "Trump overstates the problem created by the North American Free Trade Agreement, and fails to mention that Democrats in Congress were crucial to passing his new deal. He doesn't say we here."}
{"original": "The USMCA will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs, and massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers. It will also bring trade with Mexico and Canada to a much higher degree, but also to a much greater level of fairness and reciprocity. This is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America's labor unions."}
{"original": "Trump is inflating his administration's own estimate of job creation under the new trade deal – which is even higher than an estimate from an independent agency. Read more"}
{"original": "I also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China's massive theft of American jobs. Our strategy worked. Days ago, we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions of dollars into our treasury, and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the United States of America. For decades, China has taken advantage of the United States, now we have changed that but, at the same time, we have perhaps the best relationship we have ever had with China, including with President Xi. They respect what we have done because, quite frankly, they could never believe what they were able to get away with year after year, decade after decade, without someone in our country stepping up and saying: Enough. Now, we want to rebuild our country, and that is what we are doing."}
{"original": "The trade deal Trump mentions here is a half-measure of what he promised, not a solution to the problem. The US and China will try to finish the job after the next presidential election. He also fails to mention, in particular, the billions in taxpayer-funded bailouts that were required to get US farmers through after China retaliated with counter-tariffs — double the cost of the auto bailout after the financial crisis. He also does not mention the Obama-led Asia trade deal he removed the US from when he took office. That deal — with other Pacific countries — has gone forward without the US."}
{"original": "As we restore American leadership throughout the world, we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere. That is why my Administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba. We are supporting the hopes of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans to restore democracy. The United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people. But Maduro's grip of tyranny will be smashed and broken. Here this evening is a man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans. Joining us in the gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó. Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland. All Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom! Socialism destroys nations. But always remember, freedom unifies the soul."}
{"original": "Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó stands and waves upon recognition from President Trump."}
{"original": "To safeguard American Liberty, we have invested a record-breaking $2.2 trillion in the United States Military. We have purchased the finest planes, missiles, rockets, ships, and every other form of military equipment – all made in the United States of America. We are also finally getting our allies to help pay their fair share. I have raised contributions from the other NATO members by more than $400 billion, and the number of allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled."}
{"original": "And just weeks ago, for the first time since President Truman established the Air Force more than 70 years earlier, we created a new branch of the United States Armed Forces, the Space Force."}
{"original": "Space Force is Trump's brainchild, and he got it done. Here's the logo. It'll borrow 16,000 service members from the Air Force."}
{"original": "In the gallery tonight, we have one of the Space Force's youngest potential recruits: 13-year-old Iain Lanphier, an eighth grader from Arizona. Iain has always dreamed of going to space. He was first in his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy. He aspires to go to the Air Force Academy, and then, he has his eye on the Space Force. As Iain says, most people look up at space, I want to look down on the world."}
{"original": "Sitting beside Iain tonight is his great hero. Charles McGee was born in Cleveland, Ohio, one century ago. Charles is one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen – the first black fighter pilots – and he also happens to be Iain's great-grandfather. After more than 130 combat missions in World War II, he came back to a country still struggling for Civil Rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam. On December 7th, Charles celebrated his 100th birthday. A few weeks ago, I signed a bill promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General. And earlier today, I pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office. General McGee: Our Nation salutes you."}
{"original": "This is a very cool story. It's also part of a strategy on Trump's part to drive a wedge between black voters and the Democratic Party, by suggesting that he's done more for them and deserves their support."}
{"original": "From the pilgrims to our Founders, from the soldiers at Valley Forge to the marchers at Selma, and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Americans have always rejected limits on our children's future."}
{"original": "Members of Congress, we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people. The people are the heart of our country, their dreams are the soul of our country, and their love is what powers and sustains our country. We must always remember that our job is to put America first!"}
{"original": "Trump is a proud nationalist. It's the constant refrain behind his retreat from multinational trade deals and much of his protectionist economic policy."}
{"original": "The next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. Yet, for too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools. To rescue these students, 18 States have created school choice in the form of Opportunity Scholarships. The programs are so popular, that tens of thousands of students remain on waiting lists. One of those students is Janiyah Davis, a fourth grader from Philadelphia. Janiyah's mom Stephanie is a single parent. She would do anything to give her daughter a better future. But last year, that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania's Governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice for 50,000 children."}
{"original": "The American education system is a puzzle that generations of politicians have not been able to solve. States actually control public schools — or government schools, as Trump derisively calls them. It will be interesting to see how this issue of school choice — which used to mean vouchers for religious education or home schooling but today usually means charter schools — progresses in the Democratic primary. Someone like Mike Bloomberg might not be that far off from Trump on choice. Other candidates want to insure every kid is guaranteed a good education in every public school. There are no easy answers."}
{"original": "Janiyah and Stephanie are in the gallery this evening. But there is more to their story. Janiyah, I am pleased to inform you that your long wait is over. I can proudly announce tonight that an Opportunity Scholarship has become available, it is going to you, and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice!"}
{"original": "Now, I call on the Congress to give 1 million American children the same opportunity Janiyah has just received. Pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act -- because no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school."}
{"original": "This is a proposal backed by Republicans in the House and Senate and grants federal tax credits to people who donate to scholarship funds. It's been widely criticized by Democrats and the teachers' unions, who argue that it would pull money away from public schools."}
{"original": "Every young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and grow. For this reason, our magnificent First Lady has launched the Be Best initiative – to advance a safe, healthy, supportive, and drug-free life for the next generation, online, in school, and in our communities. Thank you, Melania, for your extraordinary love and profound care for America's children."}
{"original": "Here's a look at what the Be Best initiative did in its first year. Trump, whose bullying on Twitter is core to his political persona, left out the anti-cyberbullying piece of his wife's program."}
{"original": "My Administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background. Through our Pledge to American Workers, over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million Americans."}
{"original": "My Budget also contains an exciting vision for our Nation's high schools. Tonight, I ask the Congress to support our students and back my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in America."}
{"original": "To expand equal opportunity, I am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our Nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities."}
{"original": "A good life for American families also requires the most affordable, innovative, and high-quality healthcare system on Earth. Before I took office, health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just 5 years. I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives. Our new plans are up to 60 percent less expensive. I have also made an ironclad pledge to American families: We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions – that is a guarantee. And we will always protect your Medicare and your Social Security."}
{"original": "Trump's claim about protecting those with pre-existing conditions is false. Though Trump says he would do this, his administration has consistently taken steps to undermine the Affordable Care Act — including joining a lawsuit aimed at striking down the law — without presenting alternative plans that would offer similar benefits. Read more"}
{"original": "The American patient should never be blindsided by medical bills. That is why I signed an Executive Order requiring price transparency. Many experts believe that transparency, which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year, will be even bigger than healthcare reform. It will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care."}
{"original": "But as we work to improve Americans' healthcare, there are those who want to take away your healthcare, take away your doctor, and abolish private insurance entirely. One hundred thirty-two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our healthcare system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million Americans. To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare!"}
{"original": "He's talking here about Medicare for All, which would completely replace the US health care system. Read more about that here. He doesn't mention Obamacare, which he failed to repeal, but has been trying to suffocate. Republicans have not offered a workable health care plan of their own."}
{"original": "Over 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our Nation by providing free taxpayer-funded healthcare to millions of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders. These proposals would raid the Medicare benefits our seniors depend on, while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration. This is what is happening in California and other States – their systems are totally out of control, costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money. If forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left. But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free Government healthcare for illegal aliens!"}
{"original": "This will be a tremendous boon to our already very-strongly guarded southern border where, as we speak, a long, tall, and very powerful wall is being built. We have now completed over 100 miles and will have over 500 miles fully completed by early next year."}
{"original": "Trump has not gotten Congress to give him the funds necessary for his wall. Here he says it's long, tall and powerful. A section of wall being improved blew over in a strong wind this week."}
{"original": "My Administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies. We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs, and medicines are being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before. I was pleased to announce last year that, for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs actually went down."}
{"original": "And working together, the Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels. I have been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in the Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done, and done properly. I am calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices. Get a bill to my desk, and I will sign it into law without delay."}
{"original": "President Trump urged lawmakers to come up with legislation to lower prescription drug prices — a demand that prompted some Democratic lawmakers to stand up with three fingers in the air. The three fingers were for HR 3. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images"}
{"original": "With unyielding commitment, we are curbing the opioid epidemic – drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years. Among the States hardest hit, Ohio is down 22 percent, Pennsylvania is down 18 percent, Wisconsin is down 10 percent – and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all."}
{"original": "Trump's claim is correct, but it needs context. Drug overdose deaths declined in 2018 for the first time since 1990, 28 years prior. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that there were 67,367 drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2018, a 4.1% decline from 70,237 deaths in 2017. Read more"}
{"original": "Protecting Americans' health also means fighting infectious diseases. We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the Coronavirus outbreak in China. My Administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat."}
{"original": "We have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care for Americans with kidney disease, Alzheimer's, and those struggling with mental health challenges. And because the Congress funded my request, we are pursuing new cures for childhood cancer, and we will eradicate the AIDS epidemic in America by the end of the decade."}
{"original": "Trump made this pledge regarding AIDS last year too. Here's an explanation of the plan, published then."}
{"original": "Almost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness. Here tonight is a special man, someone beloved by millions of Americans who just received a Stage 4 advanced cancer diagnosis. This is not good news, but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet. Rush Limbaugh: Thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country. Rush, in recognition of all that you have done for our Nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and inspire, and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity, I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I will now ask the First Lady of the United States to please stand and present you with the honor. Rush, Kathryn, congratulations!"}
{"original": "Rush Limbaugh is one of the most divisive Americans in recent history. Full stop. Earlier recipients, according to the White House, included Steven Spielberg, Muhammad Ali, Angela Merkel, Nancy Reagan, Mother Teresa, Billy Graham, Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King, Jr."}
{"original": "First Lady Melania Trump presents Rush Limbaugh with the Presidential Medal of Freedom."}
{"original": "As we pray for all who are sick, we know that America is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs. In 2017, doctors at St. Luke's hospital in Kansas City delivered one of the earliest premature babies ever to survive. Born at just 21 weeks and 6 days, and weighing less than a pound, Ellie Schneider was born a fighter. Through the skill of her doctors – and the prayers of her parents – little Ellie kept on winning the battle for life. Today, Ellie is a strong, healthy 2-year-old girl sitting with her amazing mother Robin in the gallery. Ellie and Robin: We are so glad you are here."}
{"original": "Ellie reminds us that every child is a miracle of life. Thanks to modern medical wonders, 50 percent of very premature babies delivered at the hospital where Ellie was born now survive. Our goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like Ellie. That is why I am asking the Congress to provide an additional $50 million to fund neo-natal research for America's youngest patients. That is also why I am calling upon the Members of Congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late-term abortion of babies."}
{"original": "Whether we are Republican, Democrat, or Independent, surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God!"}
{"original": "As we support America's moms and dads, I was recently proud to sign the law providing new parents in the Federal workforce paid family leave, serving as a model for the rest of the country. Now, I call on the Congress to pass the bipartisan Advancing Support for Working Families Act, extending family leave to mothers and fathers all across the Nation."}
{"original": "This is an issue with bipartisan support and Trump put his weight behind it at the behest of his daughter, Ivanka, and brought Republicans along with him."}
{"original": "Forty million American families have an average $2,200 extra thanks to our child tax credit. I have also overseen historic funding increases for high-quality child care, enabling 17 States to serve more children, many of which have reduced or eliminated their waitlists altogether. And I sent the Congress a plan with a vision to further expand access to high-quality childcare and urge you to act immediately."}
{"original": "To protect the environment, days ago, I announced that the United States will join the One Trillion Trees Initiative, an ambitious effort to bring together Government and the private sector to plant new trees in America and around the world."}
{"original": "This is a great thing. Trump also pulled the US out of the near-worldwide Paris Climate Agreement and has shown little interest in doing anything to restrict the emissions that create global warming. Side note: it was hovering around 59 degrees in Washington as he delivered the speech. In February. A couple of weeks ago, after it hit 70 — in January — the official White House account tweeted a somewhat misleading picture of snow falling earlier in the month."}
{"original": "We must also rebuild America's infrastructure. I ask you to pass Senator Barrasso's highway bill – to invest in new roads, bridges, and tunnels across our land."}
{"original": "A massive infrastructure plan is a so-far unrealized promise of Trump's presidential campaign, aside from the endless debate about the border wall."}
{"original": "I am also committed to ensuring that every citizen can have access to high-speed internet, including rural America."}
{"original": "A better tomorrow for all Americans also requires us to keep America safe. That means supporting the men and women of law enforcement at every level, including our Nation's heroic ICE officers."}
{"original": "Last year, our brave ICE officers arrested more than 120,000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries, 5,000 sexual assaults, 45,000 violent assaults, and 2,000 murders."}
{"original": "Tragically, there are many cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens. In Sanctuary Cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public, instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed."}
{"original": "Trump likes to portray undocumented immigrants as dangerous. The reality is different. He will use this type of language throughout the election year. Here's a fact check from last year, when Trump said something similar in an Oval Office pitch for more border money."}
{"original": "Just 29 days ago, a criminal alien freed by the Sanctuary City of New York was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92-year-old woman. The killer had been previously arrested for assault, but under New York's sanctuary policies, he was set free. If the city had honored ICE's detainer request, his victim would be alive today."}
{"original": "The other story he's not telling is the one of creating fear in the immigrant community with deportations and other enforcement moves."}
{"original": "The State of California passed an outrageous law declaring their whole State to be a sanctuary for criminal illegal immigrants – with catastrophic results."}
{"original": "Here is just one tragic example. In December 2018, California police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests, including convictions for robbery and assault. But as required by California's Sanctuary Law, local authorities released him."}
{"original": "Days later, the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence. He viciously shot one man going about his daily work; he approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and the chest. He walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon. He hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles, critically injuring innocent victims. One of the victims of his bloody rampage was a 51-year-old American named Rocky Jones. Rocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range, murdering him in cold blood. Rocky left behind a devoted family, including his brothers who loved him more than anything. One of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight. Jody, would you please stand? Jody, our hearts weep for your loss – and we will not rest until you have justice."}
{"original": "Senator Thom Tillis has introduced legislation to allow Americans like Jody to sue Sanctuary Cities and States when a loved one is hurt or killed as a result of these deadly policies. I ask the Congress to pass the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act immediately. The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans – not criminal aliens!"}
{"original": "So-called sanctuary cities are a frequent target of Trump's. His record against them in court has been mixed."}
{"original": "In the last 3 years, ICE has arrested over 5,000 wicked human traffickers – and I have signed 9 pieces of legislation to stamp out the menace of human trafficking, domestically and around the globe."}
{"original": "My Administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the southern border of the United States."}
{"original": "Before I came into office, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again. My Administration has ended Catch-and-Release. If you come illegally, you will now be promptly removed. We entered into historic cooperation agreements with the Governments of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. As a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75 percent since May – dropping 8 straight months in a row. And as the wall goes up, drug seizures rise, and border crossings go down."}
{"original": "This is not true. Government data shows that, as of 2017, a majority of asylum seekers show up for their court hearings. Read more"}
{"original": "Last year, I traveled to the border in Texas and met Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz. Over the last 24 months, Agent Ortiz and his team have seized more than 200,000 pounds of poisonous narcotics, arrested more than 3,000 human smugglers, and rescued more than 2,000 migrants. Days ago, Agent Ortiz was promoted to Deputy Chief of Border Patrol – and he joins us tonight. Chief Ortiz: Please stand – a grateful Nation thanks you and all the heroes of Border Patrol."}
{"original": "To build on these historic gains, we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit, welcoming those who follow the rules, contribute to our economy, support themselves financially, and uphold our values."}
{"original": "Passing meaningful immigration reform will take bipartisanship since Republican and Democratic votes would be required. Previous efforts to find middle ground have failed, long before Trump."}
{"original": "With every action, my Administration is restoring the rule of law and re-asserting the culture of American freedom. Working with Senate Majority Leader McConnell and his colleagues in the Senate, we have confirmed a record number of 187 new Federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written. This includes two brilliant new Supreme Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh."}
{"original": "Trump can thank Mitch McConnell for his two Supreme Court nominees and his ability to pack the federal bench. Kavanaugh and Gorsuch both attended the address, along with Elena Kagan (an Obama appointee) and John Roberts (a George W. Bush appointee). But most of the justices did not attend. Roberts, by the way, has been overseeing Trump's impeachment trial. He will preside over Trump's presumed acquittal on Wednesday."}
{"original": "My Administration is also defending religious liberty, and that includes the Constitutional right to pray in public schools. In America, we do not punish prayer. We do not tear down crosses. We do not ban symbols of faith. We do not muzzle preachers and pastors. In America, we celebrate faith. We cherish religion. We lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the Glory of God!"}
{"original": "Just as we believe in the First Amendment, we also believe in another Constitutional right that is under siege all across our country. So long as I am President I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms."}
{"original": "Another interruption, this time from a protestor who began yelling while Trump spoke about protecting the Second Amendment. He was ejected from the House chamber."}
{"original": "In reaffirming our heritage as a free Nation, we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation. Now we must embrace the next frontier, America's manifest destiny in the stars. I am asking the Congress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the moon will be American astronauts – using this as a launching pad to ensure that America is the first nation to plant its flag on Mars."}
{"original": "Manifest destiny in the stars is a nice turn of phrase. (More on manifest destiny here.) The idea must be that the US is meant to expand and grow in space?"}
{"original": "My Administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical Islamic terrorism. Last week, I announced a groundbreaking plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Recognizing that all past attempts have failed, we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the change to realize a better future."}
{"original": "Three years ago, the barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria. Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS – the bloodthirsty killer Al‑Baghdadi – is dead!"}
{"original": "Trump can accurately boast about the elimination of 100% of ISIS' self-proclaimed caliphate in Syria, but it's not true that 100% of ISIS itself has been eliminated; the terrorist group existed before it seized territory and continues to exist after it lost that territory. ISIS is still a threat in the wars in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan; ISIS affiliates continue to claim responsibility for attacks elsewhere; and the US government continues to warn about ISIS' ability to inspire homegrown terrorists around the world.

{"original": "We are joined this evening by Carl and Marsha Mueller. After graduating from college, their beautiful daughter Kayla became a humanitarian aid worker. Kayla once wrote, Some people find God in church. Some people find God in nature. Some people find God in love; I find God in suffering. I've known for some time what my life's work is, using my hands as tools to relieve suffering. In 2013, while caring for suffering civilians in Syria, Kayla was kidnapped, tortured, and enslaved by ISIS, and kept as a prisoner of Al-Baghdadi himself. After more than 500 horrifying days of captivity, Al-Baghdadi murdered young Kayla. She was just 26 years old."}
{"original": "On the night that United States Special Forces Operators ended Al‑Baghdadi's miserable life, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, received a call in the Situation Room. He was told that the brave men of the elite Special Forces team, that so perfectly carried out the operation, had given their mission a name – Task Force 8-14. It was a reference to a special day: August 14th – Kayla's birthday. Carl and Marsha, America's warriors never forgot Kayla – and neither will we."}

{"original": "One of these American heroes was Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake. On his second deployment to Iraq in 2008, Sergeant Hake wrote a letter to his 1-year-old son, Gage: I will be with you again, he wrote to Gage. I will teach you to ride your first bike, build your first sand box, watch you play sports and see you have kids also. I love you son, take care of your mother. I am always with you. Dad. On Easter Sunday of 2008, Chris was out on patrol in Baghdad when his Bradley Fighting Vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb. That night, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal glory in Arlington, and his wife Kelli is in the gallery tonight, joined by their son, who is now 13 years old. To Kelli and Gage: Chris will live in our hearts forever."}
{"original": "The terrorist responsible for killing Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani, who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chris's life. Soleimani was the Iranian Regime's most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq. As the world's top terrorist, Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women, and children. He directed the December assault on United States Forces in Iraq, and was actively planning new attacks. That is why, last month, at my direction, the United States Military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever."}
{"original": "He doesn't mention here that this was an incredibly controversial move, nearly sparked a war with Iran, drew condemnation from the international community and drew a rebuke from Congress. It's not at all clear there was immediate intelligence Trump acted on or whether killing Iran's top general was more of a policy goal."}
{"original": "Our message to the terrorists is clear: You will never escape American justice. If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life!"}
{"original": "In recent months, we have seen proud Iranians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers. The Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons, stop spreading terror, death, and destruction, and start working for the good of its own people. Because of our powerful sanctions, the Iranian economy is doing very poorly. We can help them make it very good in a short period of time, but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help. We are here. Let's see which road they choose. It is totally up to them."}
{"original": "Trump withdrew from a nuclear deal with Iran in part because it was left over from the Obama administration. He has not yet been able to secure a new deal. His record of achieving nuclear deals with despots is not good. Two words that do not appear in this State of the Union: North Korea. Remember when he promised peace and a nuclear deal with North Korea? Distant memory."}
{"original": "As we defend American lives, we are working to end America's wars in the Middle East."}
{"original": "In Afghanistan, the determination and valor of our warfighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress, and peace talks are underway. I am not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan, many of them innocent. It is also not our function to serve other nations as a law enforcement agency. These are warfighters, the best in the world, and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all. We are working to finally end America's longest war and bring our troops back home!"}

Amy works full time, and volunteers countless hours helping other military families. For the past 7 months, she has done it all while her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, is in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment to the Middle East. Amy's kids have not seen their father's face in many months. Amy, your family's sacrifice makes it possible for all of our families to live in safety and peace – we thank you."}
{"original": "President Trump reunited a military family during his address when Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams walked out, a surprise return from his fourth deployment to the Middle East."}

{"original": "It's tough being a first-time buyer in today's housing market."}
{"original": "Home prices are hitting record highs in many parts of the country, often selling for more than the asking price, and going from list to contract in a record 37 days, according to Redfin."}
{"original": "We've never seen a faster or more competitive market, says Redfin spokeswoman Rachel Musiker. Basically this market isn't for the faint of heart."}
{"original": "Don't make it even harder (or more expensive) for yourself by making these common mistakes:"}
{"original": "1. Assuming you won't get approved for a mortgage"}
{"original": "Ideally, you'd like to have as little debt as possible, an impeccable credit score, and a 20% down payment before borrowing money for a home. However, even borrowers with less can get loans in today's market, thanks to options like Federal Housing Authority loans, which are meant to help out low-income and first-time buyers."}
{"original": "The fees and rates offered by lenders may vary substantially, and they all offer different service levels and different loan products. Be sure to at least chat with a big bank, a regional bank or credit union, and an online lender."}
{"original": "3. Not getting pre-approved early on"}
{"original": "Getting pre-approved for a mortgage serves two important purposes: First, it gives you a realistic understanding of how much you can spend on the house. Second, it shows sellers that you're serious and gives you slightly more standing if you're competing for homes with all-cash buyers."}
{"original": "Make it less stressful by gathering up relevant financial documents like bank statements, tax returns, and pay stubs, and by checking your credit report for errors in advance. Given the competitive interest rate environment and the competitive housing market, it's a good idea to be prepared and organized before you start the process, says Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com."}
{"original": "4. Maxing out your mortgage limit"}
{"original": "Just because a lender says that you can borrow a certain amount, doesn't mean you should borrow that much. Staying below that limit will give you more financial flexibility to cover the added expenses that come with purchasing a home, as well as long-term changes to your income."}
{"original": "Create a budget that includes how much money you can spend on housing costs each month, and then use those numbers to figure out what your real limit should be."}
{"original": "5. Letting your emotions control your decisions"}
{"original": "Buying a home can be a long and frustrating process. These days, starter homes go quickly, and it's common for first-time buyers to experience rejection on the first offers they make. In that kind of environment, it's easy to fall in love with a house that's out of your budget, or get caught up in the heat of a bidding war and end up paying more than you expected."}
{"original": "It's OK to get excited when you think you've found your house, but you don't want to put yourself in a bad spot, says David Tina, President of the Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors."}
{"original": "6. Waiving contingencies without understanding the risks"}
{"original": "In highly competitive markets, it's becoming increasingly common for buyers to make offers that aren't contingent on financing or inspection. While waiving contingencies can make your bid more desirable to a seller, it can make the transaction much more risky for you. Have a conversation with your realtor and a lawyer before opting out of contingencies in your contract. In a worst-case scenario, you may end up losing your deposit."}
{"original": "7. Allowing your credit score to change before the close"}
{"original": "A pre-approval letter is not a guarantee of funding, and if your credit score or income levels change drastically between the pre-approval and the closing of the loan, lenders may change their terms or rescind the offer entirely. While you're home shopping, be sure to pay all your bills on time and steer clear of new credit accounts, even if that means you have to wait to pick out your furniture. If possible, try not to switch jobs until after you close, particularly if you're moving into a new industry."}

{"original": "Why there are so few new cars in Ethiopia"}
{"original": "For a population of 97 million, Ethiopia has just 84,000 registered vehicles."}
{"original": "Most of these are imported, but there is an emerging field of foreign companies manufacturing cars inside Ethiopia's borders."}
{"original": "China's Lifan Group opened a factory in Addis Ababa in 2014, which has capacity to assemble 20 cars a day. The parts are imported from China, but 97 percent of its employees are local workers."}
{"original": "Producing cars locally allows Lifan to avoid paying the 35 percent import tax that applies to foreign vehicles, and offer consumers a cheaper product. Lifan vehicles are available for $15,000, similar to the price of used imports, which could be a strong competitive advantage."}
{"original": "Lifan is a new car, says factory supervisor Figo Wang. Nissan and Toyota may be second hand because (they are) too expensive."}
{"original": "Lifan may also benefit from a wider appetite to see more new cars in operation on the road."}
{"original": "These old cars pollute the country, and they cost a lot of money to import spare parts, says Constantinos Berhuetesfa Constantinos, professor of public policy at Addis Ababa University. New cars…will reduce the transportation problems here."}
{"original": "Other Chinese manufacturers such as Geely are also basing operations in Ethiopia, and the new field looks set to grow."}

{"original": "(CNN) President Donald Trump's actions during his final days in office have significantly increased his exposure to potential criminal prosecution, lawyers say, complicating his life after the White House."}
{"original": "Over five days last week -- beginning with a phone call to the Georgia Secretary of State directing him to find votes to overturn the election to encouraging the pro-Trump crowd to show strength in their march to the Capitol -- lawyers say the President has put himself under the microscope of state and federal prosecutors."}
{"original": "There are potential state and federal crimes that he can be prosecuted for just for the things he's done this past week and what's troubling for him is he won't have the immunity from prosecution that DOJ say says a sitting president has as of next Wednesday, said Harry Sandick, a former federal prosecutor."}
{"original": "The new possible criminal exposure comes on top of ongoing New York state investigations into the President's finances and multiple defamation lawsuits related to Trump denying sexual assault accusations by women. The Manhattan district attorney's office has a broad criminal investigation looking into allegations of insurance fraud and tax fraud. The New York attorney general has a civil investigation into whether the Trump Organization improperly inflated the value of its assets."}
{"original": "The New York criminal investigation has been slowed by a fight over the President's tax records , a scrum that is again before the Supreme Court. The wait has stopped prosecutors from contacting Trump's private banker or seeking interviews with employees of the Trump Organization, people familiar with the matter say. Lawyers have speculated the court may be waiting for Trump's term to end next week before ruling."}
{"original": "Sandick and other lawyers, however, say that as alarming as Trump's recent statements have been, there are multiple hurdles for prosecutors to prove that the President violated election laws or those relating to incitement or sedition."}
{"original": "The incitement ones are challenging if you only have evidence of his own words because they're sufficiently ambiguous that it would be hard to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, said Sandick."}
{"original": "But the evidence is not only his own words. He organized this event, he invited [Rudy] Giuliani and Congressman [Mo] Brooks to speak. They made statements that were far more expressive than Trump's own, said Sandick. If you add into the case the fact that there may have been some coordination with the rioters and other speakers, then prosecutors could build a case against Trump, he added."}
{"original": "On Tuesday, Trump defended his remarks, saying lawyers vetted them and said they were appropriate. Speaking at Joint Base Andrews before departing for Texas, Trump falsely said those who'd analyzed his remarks had found no fault in them."}
{"original": "It's been analyzed, he said. People thought what I said was totally appropriate."}
{"original": "They've analyzed my speech, my words, he continued. Everybody to a T thought it was appropriate."}
{"original": "The new exposure Trump faces as he leaves office comes as the President is already part of a wide-ranging criminal investigation by the Manhattan District Attorneys' office, which is looking into a range of potential state crimes."}
{"original": "He is also facing a civil investigation from the New York attorney general's office, which is looking at whether the President improperly inflated the value of his assets to obtain loans or favorable tax benefits. And, then, there are defamation lawsuits sparked by Trump denying accusations made by women who have alleged he assaulted them, including E. Jean Carroll, the former magazine columnist who has accused him of rape and Summer Zervos , who claims the President sexually assaulted her in 2007. Those cases have been delayed in the courts largely because of Trump's position -- that will no longer be the case next week."}
{"original": "Manhattan prosecutors have been interviewing individuals and examining evidence, but their investigation has been slowed as they wait for the Supreme Court to rule on a subpoena issued 16 months ago to Trump's accountan t for the President's personal and business tax records."}
{"original": "Cary Dunne, general counsel for Vance's office, told a judge in July that the subpoena delay has led to continuing concerns about the potential loss of critical evidence and expiration of statutes of limitations."}
{"original": "In October, a federal appeals court found the subpoena was not overly broad or issued in bad faith, but the Supreme Court has not ruled for three months on Trump's request for a stay of the decision."}
{"original": "As the dispute has lingered in the courts, key investigative steps have been on hold, those people say say. Prosecutors can't confront key witnesses without the documents or determine whether there is evidence that any laws have been broken, people familiar with the matter say."}
{"original": "Investigators subpoenaed Trump lender Deutsche Bank for records in late 2019 and interviewed employees about underwriting practices after the election, but they were not involved in the Trump loans."}
{"original": "Prosecutors have also not been in contact with Rosemary Vrablic, Trump's private banker at Deutsche Bank, which has loaned the President more than $300 million dollars, people familiar with the investigation said. Last month , Vrablic's lawyer said she is committed to cooperating with authorities if asked. Investigators also have not sought interviews with any employees of the Trump Organization, the people say."}
{"original": "Lawyers for the New York attorney general's office, which has a lower burden of proof in civil investigations, have also dealt with delays. Eric Trump, the President's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, fought a subpoena for his testimony for four months until a judge ordered him to be deposed in October. One of Trump's tax attorneys is also in a back and forth with the state over the disclosure of certain records."}
{"original": "Precedent of not prosecuting former presidents"}
{"original": "The President's actions this past week have already cost him financially -- the PGA of America said on Sunday night it would not hold its championship in 2022 at the Trump golf course in New Jersey and Deutsche Bank said it would not do business with him -- and the specter of ongoing criminal investigations may have a longer-term impact on his business prospects. New York City announced Wednesday that it is taking steps to cancel contracts with Trump Org for the Ferry Point golf course and carousel and ice skating rink in Central Park."}
{"original": "Trump's recent statements will present the Biden administration, which has made calls for unity, and his Justice Department with the dilemma of potentially prosecuting a former president."}
{"original": "Biden's nominee for Attorney General, Judge Merrick Garland, has a reputation for even handedness. He also has experience with domestic terrorism cases having prosecuted the Oklahoma City bombers."}
{"original": "There's a long precedent of not prosecuting former presidents over policy differences, said Elliot Williams, a CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor. The difference is we're not talking about policy difference here, and this is perhaps the most egregious conduct we've ever seen from a president while in office. If they have chargeable offenses there's a really strong case to be made for pursuing them against President Trump."}
{"original": "Some former prosecutors say that a lot of the conduct is morally reprehensible, but it isn't clear if it will cross the line into violating the law. Investigators will need to prove the President intended to commit crimes, a high bar in criminal cases, not that he was encouraging lawful protests or truly believed that he won the election."}
{"original": "This weekend, in an interview with NPR, acting US attorney for Washington, DC, Michael Sherwin doubled down on his earlier statements that investigators are looking at any and all actors, including the President, Giuliani and others who revved up the crowd."}
{"original": "Look, I meant what I said before. In any criminal investigation, I don't care if it's a drug trafficking conspiracy case, a human trafficking case or the Capitol, all persons will be looked at, Sherwin told NPR. If the evidence leads to any actor that may have had a role in this and if that evidence meets the four corners of a federal charge or a local charge, we're going to pursue it, he said."}
{"original": "Like the riot, the legal liability for Trump's call to Georgia election officials will turn on his statements. Trump called the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, imploring him to find 11,780 votes to give him the edge to overturn the election. It followed a call in December in which Trump told a Georgia elections investigator to search for dishonesty in the 2020 presidential election, telling the individual that the investigation was of national importance, according to a source with knowledge of the call."}
{"original": "The calls have prompted letters and calls for state and federal investigations into Trump's conduct. It isn't clear if there is an active investigation. Former prosecutors say the outreach is worth federal prosecutors' scrutiny even if Trump wasn't successful because of the intimidation and threats the officials have faced."}
{"original": "As the end of Trump's presidency nears, sources tell CNN Trump has considered pardoning himself , his family members and other allies from federal charges. Lawyers say it is not clear whether a self-pardon would hold up in court, but a presidential pardon has no bearing on state investigations."}
{"original": "If Trump escapes his presidency without any criminal charges, lawyers say, his last weeks in office have assured him a place in history."}
{"original": "Even if prosecutors don't end up charging him, the fact is that there's a basis here for investigating multiple different federal crimes at once, said Williams, adding, there are a lot of mobsters who don't even have that many criminal investigations open involving them at one time."}

{"original": "The World Bank has been warning of a worldwide economic slowdown for a while now, but its projections just took a turn for the worse."}
{"original": "In a 200-page report issued Tuesday, the international financial institution laid out evidence that emerging markets have been stagnating, as trade has contracted and financing conditions have worsened. The Bank knocked down its expectations for this year's global growth to 2.9% from its previous forecast of 3%. It also lowered its 2020 growth forecast to 2.8% from 2.9%."}
{"original": "The World Bank blamed the downgrade on the global economy's more-sudden-than-expected deceleration since the institution's last forecast in June."}
{"original": "And the situation could deteriorate further — confirming Wall Street's concerns about next year being a difficult one for American companies with significant business abroad."}
{"original": "Downside risks have become more acute, the Bank's report reads. Disorderly financial market developments could disrupt activity in the affected economies and lead to contagion effects. Trade disputes could escalate or become more widespread, denting activity in the economies involved and leading to negative global spillovers."}
{"original": "The United States is still among the best performing economies in the world, but its growth streak could run out soon, as the effects of the tax cuts and government spending wear off, and the era of easy money fades further into the distance as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Although a recession isn't obviously around the corner, a volatile political environment and mounting corporate debt loads are a toxic cocktail."}
{"original": "The policy mix in the United States will shift from expansionary to contractionary during the forecast horizon, with monetary, fiscal, and trade policies all expected to become a drag on activity within the next couple of years, the authors write. In this context, relatively small negative shocks have the potential to abruptly end the current expansion."}
{"original": "Still, the implications of an economic crunch are probably worse for low-income countries, many of which haven't managed to raise per-capita incomes enough to keep closing the gap with the developed world. Although absolute poverty has been declining in places like India, progress has stalled in Sub-Saharan Africa, which the World Bank projects could hold as much as 87% of the planet's poor people by 2030."}
{"original": "In order to keep the global economy on an even keel, the bank recommends that countries invest more in developing their residents' skills, ease restrictions on investment, and reduce barriers to trade — rather than raise them, as the United States has recently done by imposing tariffs on 12% of its goods imports."}

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own."}
{"original": "The economy is booming. Yet the Fed seems to be doing everything in its power to undermine growth, and has set us on a path toward deflation."}
{"original": "After the Fed's rate hikes in September and December, and the central bank's announcement that more interest rate hikes were on the way in 2019, the stock market had its worst December since the Great Depression. Many have defended Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's rate hike decisions, saying he wants to prevent the economy from overheating. But the Fed has in fact created a very dangerous deflation in prices."}
{"original": "Some economists have publicly disagreed with me about this stance, including Nobel prize winner Paul Krugman — yes, the same economist who said the day after Trump was elected that the stock market would never recover from a Trump presidency. One Washington Post columnist told CNN there is no deflation in prices."}
{"original": "But sure enough, the December Consumer Price Index number released earlier this month showed that prices declined by 0.1% over the previous month. Granted, it was a small decline over a period of just one month, but when prices fall, that's called deflation."}
{"original": "But the most serious sign of deflation I am warning about is the much sharper decline in commodity prices — silver, steel, copper, soy beans, cheese, oil and so on. The standard measure of 19 major commodity prices ( the CRB index ) shows that commodity prices fell by nearly 13% from Jan. 2, 2018 to Dec. 31, 2018, and by around 12.5% in 2018 since the Fed's September interest rate hike."}
{"original": "Over the past year, the price of oil is down around 19%, silver around 11%, soybeans at about 8%, cheese nearly 8%, steel over 5%, hogs 17%, and aluminum nearly 16%. Ask an oil producer or a soybean farmer if they think there is inflation in prices. They are getting clobbered by the declining prices."}
{"original": "Some of this, such as the low soybean, silver and platinum prices, can be due to the trade war with China, for sure. But the trade war doesn't account for the across-the-board reductions in prices. Declines in commodity prices are reported every day and are a reliable lead indicator of where consumer prices are headed."}
{"original": "As we learned during the Great Depression, deflation can be even more destructive than inflation, as it leads to a shrinkage of the economy."}
{"original": "Commodity prices are falling because we have too few dollars chasing the increasing production of a strong American economy. Injecting more dollars into the economy would stop deflation immediately, just as reducing the supply of dollars is the antidote to inflation."}
{"original": "The good news is that the Fed began to dial it back in late December and made clear to investors that further deflationary rate hikes were under reconsideration. The stock market has surged in the weeks after this news."}
{"original": "Which begs the question: Why did the Fed raise rates in September and December in the first place? There were almost seven million open jobs in November last year, and 2018 saw the lowest unemployment rate since the 1960s and is on track to see real economic growth of more than 3% for the first time since 2005. Average hourly pay was up. And inflation of consumer prices even before the rate hikes have been pretty flat, growing at about 1% to 2%, which is right in the sweet zone that the Fed targets."}
{"original": "The Fed rate hike appears to have been a solution to a nonexistent economic problem. Analysts have defended Powell by saying that the Fed wants to prevent overheating. Huh? Does this mean the Fed is worried that too many Americans are working or that they are earning too much money? If so, that is a very nice compliment to Trump's tax cut and deregulation policies. One thing is for sure: We never had to worry about an overheating economy under President Obama."}
{"original": "The key point is that 3% to 4% real GDP growth, which is the achievable long-term goal of Trumponomics, is not inflationary. Let me scream it from the mountain top: Growth does not cause inflation."}
{"original": "Trump has been criticized for railing against the Fed, but his argument was right. There is no inflation. And the faster growth we are aiming for can't happen if the Fed's policies are explicitly designed to restrain growth."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, liberal economists are surprisingly and steadfastly defending the Fed despite the negative growth and stock market consequences. They used to fume about austerity economic policies — and they were often right. Now they are suddenly defending Fed austerity and wage-restraining monetary policies?"}
{"original": "Some of my critics say that the reason that prices are falling is that the outlook for world growth has slowed. Note that this is the opposite of the overheating argument. But let us assume that slow global growth, or even a global recession, were coming. In that case, and if one believes in the Phillips Curve , there is no case for the recent rate hikes."}
{"original": "If there is anything good to come of the Fed's recent blunders, it is to the painful reminder that the central bank is not infallible and that monetary mistakes can cause economic mayhem."}
{"original": "Mild deflation is here right now. To stop it, the Fed should start cutting rates immediately, or using open market operations to buy government bonds, rather than sell them. The goal should be to stabilize commodity prices so that the dollar performs the role that a currency is supposed to do: Retain its value over time."}
{"original": "(CNN) He was never called upon to break a tie or influence how the Senate impeachment trial might end, but Chief Justice John Roberts' legacy will be forever entwined with President Donald Trump's."}
{"original": "It's not just that Roberts was in the chair presiding over the two-week hearing and historic vote on Wednesday to acquit Trump, just as Chief Justice Salmon Chase oversaw the acquittal of President Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Chief Justice William Rehnquist that of President Bill Clinton in 1999."}
{"original": "Roberts now faces unprecedented litigation at the Supreme Court involving the President's personal business dealings. The justices will hear three cases in March testing Trump's efforts to block subpoenas from the US House and a Manhattan district attorney for his tax returns and other financial records."}

{"original": "If Trump wins another four-year term, Roberts could be in the position of ruling on a Trump-dominated docket until 2025."}
{"original": "Irrespective of whether this President serves one term or two, America's 17th chief justice is already bound for an unusual union with the 45th President, arising from the combination of Trump's impeachment trial, Supreme Court litigation and their dueling notions of an impartial federal judiciary."}

{"original": "The travel ban, Roberts wrote in a June 2018 opinion , is an act that ... could have been taken by any other President. Roberts rejected evidence of Trump's anti-Muslim remarks, saying that we must consider not only the statements of a particular President, but the authority of the Presidency itself."}
{"original": "Whether Roberts' time presiding over the impeachment trial has altered his view of Trump might be seen over time. Roberts is in his 15th year as chief justice and, at only age 65, he could easily serve five more years, or twice that."}
{"original": "The Constitution specifically dictates that the chief justice presides over the impeachment trial of a president. The role is distinct from the real authority of the chief justice at the Supreme Court."}
{"original": "The Senate has the sole power, according to the Constitution, to decide whether a president is convicted or acquitted. A two-thirds vote is required, and on Wednesday afternoon the Senate failed to reach that 67-vote threshold or even a simple majority. The vote was 48-52 to convict Trump on an abuse of power charge and 47-53 on an obstruction of Congress charge."}
{"original": "The US House in December had passed two articles of impeachment related to Trump's alleged conditioning of US security aid to Ukraine on Ukrainian investigations of Democrats. Last Friday the Senate voted against hearing from witnesses who might have direct knowledge of Trump's dealings on Ukraine."}
{"original": "After that vote, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, queried Roberts as to whether he would become involved in other matters . Is the chief justice aware that in the impeachment trial of President Johnson, Chief Justice Chase, as presiding officer, cast tie-breaking votes on both March 31 and April 2, 1868?"}
{"original": "Appearing to speak from a prepared text, Roberts responded, I am, Mr. Leader. The one concerned a motion to adjourn; the other concerned a motion to close deliberations. I do not regard those isolated episodes 150 years ago as sufficient to support a general authority to break ties."}
{"original": "Roberts continued, drawing a line between the legislative and judicial branches, If the members of this body elected by the people and accountable to them divide equally on a motion, the normal rule is that the motion fails. I think it would be inappropriate for me, an unelected official from a different branch of government, to assert the power to change that result so that the motion would succeed."}
{"original": "As Roberts sidestepped the controversy over witnesses, he also showed little emotion as he read senators' often awkward, leading questions for the House impeachment managers and Trump's lawyers (per the customary process). Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said a total of 180 questions were delivered to Roberts to read."}
{"original": "One of the most dramatic moments came when Roberts rejected an attempt by Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky to induce him to say aloud the name of the alleged whistleblower who first brought Trump's Ukrainian dealings to public light."}
{"original": "Perhaps most striking was the many hours Roberts endured on the dais hearing piercing criticism of the President, who is becoming a regular litigant at the Supreme Court. US House managers characterized Trump as a liar and cheat, a man who put his own interests above those of the country."}
{"original": "Trump's lawyers rejected those assertions but seemed to accept some transgressions, saying that no matter what the President had done, his conduct did not warrant a Senate conviction."}
{"original": "Neither Johnson nor Clinton faced voters for another term after their impeachments, and Chief Justices Chase and Rehnquist did not hear protracted court disputes in the vein of what Roberts already has on the docket related to Trump."}
{"original": "The cases tied most directly to Trump, centered on whether his personal business records are subject to subpoena, will be heard on March 31."}
{"original": "Unlike his role in the Senate, at the high court Roberts will cast votes and, in fact, could steer the outcomes of the cases, Trump v. Mazars, Trump v. Deutsche Bank and Trump v. Vance. Roberts not only sits at the center of the elevated mahogany bench but also resides at the ideological middle of the nine-member court."}
{"original": "Trump's veracity, which was attacked by the House managers during the impeachment trial, is also at issue in the subpoena cases. As lawyers for the House noted in one of their filings to the justices, A common thread in each of these inquiries is the accuracy of statements made by President Trump on various financial disclosures."}
{"original": "House lawyers say the disclosures are needed for committees in the House of Representatives that are exploring the possibility of new legislation on conflicts of interest and other ethical concerns."}
{"original": "Trump's lawyers say the House lacks the constitutional or statutory authority to subpoena the documents, held by Trump's longtime accountants and banks: To call these subpoenas unprecedented would be an understatement. This is the first time that Congress has subpoenaed private records of a sitting President."}
{"original": "They quarrel with the House's assertion that the Trump financial information is needed for a legislative purpose. Trump lawyers noted that a request to the Mazars USA accounting firm said the House wanted to investigate the accuracy of the President's financial statements to see if he had broken the law. Such an investigative focus, Trump's lawyers say, reveals that House committees are not engaged in a legislative effort."}
{"original": "In Trump v. Vance -- testing a subpoena sought by Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance, who is looking into hush money paid to women who claimed affairs with Trump -- the President's lawyers have asserted that he is immune from criminal investigation -- not only from indictment, which had been common understanding -- while he holds office."}
{"original": "Beyond the Senate trial and Supreme Court litigation, Trump and Roberts have collided over regard for the impartiality of the judiciary. Trump has suggested in remarks on Twitter and elsewhere that he believes his judicial appointees would side with him, while Democratic appointees would automatically rule against him."}
{"original": "When Trump denigrated a California US district judge who had ruled against the administration as an Obama judge, Roberts issued a statement in November 2018 that said, We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them."}
{"original": "In Roberts' most recent year-end report , issued on December 31, he might have had the Twitter-addicted President in mind when he said that social media can instantly spread rumor and false information on a grand scale. The chief justice urged people to celebrate our strong and independent judiciary."}
{"original": "At his State of the Union speech on Tuesday night, Trump shook hands with Roberts, as he did with other justices in attendance. Roberts looked somber, betraying none of what he was thinking, as was his way during the Senate trial."}
{"original": "As the Trump trial closed less than 24 hours later, Roberts expressed appreciation to Senate leaders for their support as he attempted to carry out ill-defined responsibilities in an unfamiliar setting. He offered senators good wishes as we carry out our common commitment to the Constitution."}
{"original": "And Roberts closed by saying he looked forward to seeing them again under happier circumstances."}

{"original": "Editor's Note: Roger P. Alford is associate dean for international and graduate programs at the University of Notre Dame Law School. The opinions in this article belong to the author."}
{"original": "Donald Trump might want to impose a 20% tariff on Mexican imports as the best way to force Mexico to pay for a border wall."}
{"original": "According to White House spokesman Sean Spicer, a tax on Mexican imports will easily pay for the wall."}
{"original": "Spicer later seemed to walk back on the comments, saying it was just one of the many ideas the administration is considering for funding the wall."}
{"original": "It sounds so easy and simple. Build a physical wall and pay for it with a tariff wall."}
{"original": "But there is nothing easy about such a tax increase; what Trump conveniently ignores is that any tax on Mexican imports would be passed on to US consumers, manufacturers and exporters. One way or another, we will pay for that wall."}
{"original": "According to the Office of the US Trade Representative, Mexico is the third-largest US goods trading partner, with more than $296 billion in imports in 2015."}
{"original": "Based on current trade flows, a 20% tariff would effectively impose a $59.2 billion tax on US consumers who purchase Mexican imports. That means that billions of dollars' worth of Mexican fruits, vegetables, beer, minerals, equipment and cars would all be 20% more expensive to US consumers."}
{"original": "Mexico also is one of our most important supply chain partners, so the tax also means that US industry would pay billions more in taxes on Mexican products used for manufacturing at home. And Mexico is our second-largest export market, with hundreds of billions of dollars in goods exported from the United States to Mexico every year. Any tax on Mexican imports risks retaliatory taxes on US exports."}
{"original": "Why? Because the proposed tax on Mexican products unequivocally violates our treaty commitments and there is a real and tangible cost for such violations."}
{"original": "02:20 - Source: CNN Mexican peso drops as president cancels Trump meeting"}
{"original": "Under World Trade Organization rules we have agreed to limit our tariffs on products to bound rates, and any increase above those rates violates WTO rules."}
{"original": "We also have most favored nation commitments, which precludes WTO members from treating one WTO member worse than other members. (There are exceptions to this rule, including preferential treatment in the context of free trade agreements such as NAFTA.)"}
{"original": "Trump's proposed tax increase on Mexican products clearly violates both of those treaty commitments."}
{"original": "The North American Free Trade Agreement has similar prohibitions, including its Article 302, which prohibits the United States from increas(ing) any customs duty."}
{"original": "Mexico could sue the United States before the WTO to challenge the illegal tax. Mexico would be authorized to impose retaliatory duties equal to the harm caused by the violation. (Mexico could sue under NAFTA as well, and when it succeeds, suspend US NAFTA benefits.)"}
{"original": "So if Trump imposes a 20% ($59.2 billion) tariff on $296 billion worth of Mexican imports, Mexico could legally impose the same amount on US exports to Mexico. Every dollar we illegally tax on Mexican products is a dollar that Mexico can lawfully tax on US products."}
{"original": "These trade rules were designed precisely to stop the arbitrary and capricious behavior that Trump is proposing. Trade rules provide stability from the winds of political change and raise the costs of illegal behavior such as a discriminatory import tax increase."}

{"original": "The United States benefits from this scheme because we are protected from the same quixotic behavior of others. What goes around comes around, and in the world of trade, reciprocity rules the day."}
{"original": "Like any trade war, everyone loses with Trump's proposed tariff wall. US consumers lose by paying more for Mexican products. US manufacturers lose due to dramatic increases in their supply chain costs. And US exporters lose when Mexico retaliates (as it surely will) on more than $236 billion in US exports."}
{"original": "When Trump says that Mexico will reimburse us to build a wall, what he really means is that US taxpayers will pay for the wall now, and US consumers will pay for the wall later."}
{"original": "Washington (CNN) The Senate unanimously passed a $2 trillion stimulus deal late Wednesday that includes sending checks directly to individuals amid the coronavirus crisis -- but it will likely take weeks before the money goes out."}
{"original": "President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are still pushing to get the direct payments issued by April 6, a White House official told CNN. The date was floated as a deadline earlier by Mnuchin during negotiations."}
{"original": "Mnuchin said Wednesday that the administration expects to begin issuing direct payments to taxpayers within three weeks of a stimulus package being signed into law."}
{"original": "Our expectation is within three weeks we will have direct payments out where we have depository information, Mnuchin said. We're looking to get a lot more information and we have procedures to do that."}
{"original": "Mnuchin added that by the end of next week, the administration wants all banks to be able to originate loans on a same day basis."}
{"original": "Under previous programs in 2001 and 2008, the government took longer than a month to distribute checks."}
{"original": "It is extremely unlikely that people will get payments by April 6 -- just two weeks from now, said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. It is more realistic to expect them in a month or two."}
{"original": "A Republican Senate aide told reporters on Wednesday that they had heard estimates that the administration would be able to get started on about half of the rebates within a few weeks because the individuals had electronically filed their returns. The aide said that paper checks would take a bit longer because the Bureau of Fiscal Service can only process and push out so many paper checks a week."}
{"original": "It's a pretty significant number but it would probably take -- I think they were estimating four or five weeks to get the balance out, added the aide."}
{"original": "$1,200 for individuals, $2,400 for couples, $500 per child"}
{"original": "Under the legislation, single Americans would receive $1,200, married couples would get $2,400, and parents would see $500 for each child under age 17."}
{"original": "However, the payments would start to phase out for individuals with adjusted gross incomes of more than $75,000, and those making more than $99,000 would not qualify at all. The thresholds are doubled for couples."}
{"original": "About 90% of Americans would be eligible to receive full or partial payments, according to estimates by the Tax Policy Center. Lawmakers set aside $250 billion for the so-called recovery rebates."}
{"original": "Qualifying income levels will be based on 2019 federal tax returns, if already filed, and otherwise on 2018 returns. ( Mnuchin earlier this month delayed the filing deadline until July 15."}
{"original": "There are provisions in the bill to include those who don't earn enough to file returns, but some people may be missed, said Gleckman."}
{"original": "Under the legislation, lower- and middle-income Americans would receive just over two-thirds of the benefits, Gleckman said. An earlier version of the bill would have given lower-income households less or no assistance."}
{"original": "How it worked in 2001 and 2008"}
{"original": "The Internal Revenue Service has sent out economic stimulus checks before"}
{"original": "In 2001, it took six weeks for the IRS to start sending out rebate checks authorized by President George W. Bush's tax cut. Then in 2008, amid the Great Recession, it took three months for the checks to start going out after the law was signed by Bush. In that case, Americans were required to file their tax return first, in order to get the check. Once they filed their return, it took between eight and 12 weeks to see the money."}
{"original": "Certainly from what we've seen in the past, it's taken a pretty significant amount of time to get checks out after a policy is put in place, said Erica York, an economist at the Tax Foundation."}
{"original": "Those who had authorized direct deposits to their bank accounts likely received their money faster, York said. Those deposits were made over a three-week period in 2008, while paper checks were sent through the mail over a 10-week period."}
{"original": "Americans might receive the stimulus payments slightly faster than in 2008 because more of them now file electronically and provide the IRS with their bank information, Gleckman said. Some 88% of individual returns were filed electronically in 2018, compared with 58% in 2008."}
{"original": "Nina Olson, who served as the IRS's national taxpayer advocate from 2001 to 2019, said Wednesday that maybe, just maybe, some payments could be issued by April 6, likely to people who have already filed their returns."}
{"original": "But there are other factors that may slow the process. Even absent the coronavirus challenges, the agency is working with a smaller budget and less staff than it had in 2010."}
{"original": "Now, because of the coronavirus, the agency has shut down its in-person taxpayer assistance centers located across the country at a time when people are sure to have questions about the emergency checks and other changes. Treasury announced last week that it is pushing back the tax return deadline to July 15 . Additionally, Congress created a new tax credit designed to refund businesses that are offering their employees coronavirus-related paid leave."}
{"original": "It's just a recipe for confusion, said Olson."}
{"original": "There can be a lot of complexity involved in something as simple as sending a check out, she added."}
{"original": "First, the IRS will have to calculate each person's payment amount. Then, it will need the correct direct deposit information or mailing addresses. To get the money to people who don't usually file tax returns, it might have to request that information from the Social Security Administration or Veterans Affairs. In 2008, those people were required to file a return anyway in order to get their rebate."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, the IRS will inevitably be fielding calls from Americans concerned about when their check will arrive and whether they took all the necessary steps to receive the money. In 2001, the agency sent out letters to taxpayers telling them they didn't have to do anything in order to receive their check. But instead of staving off calls, the notice had the reverse effect. It resulted in the agency's first 1 million-call day, Olson said."}
{"original": "Later in 2008, after the economic stimulus checks were sent out, Olson testified before Congress, telling lawmakers that they should fund a new unit within the agency that would be dedicated to facilitating new and emergency initiatives. She argued that it would free up other employees to focus on improving the existing systems and executing the day-to-day work of the agency -- but that never happened."}

{"original": "Welcome to Venice in a post-Covid world. The canal city may have been known as La Serenissima, or The Most Serene, during its centuries ruling the waves as the powerful Republic of Venice."}
{"original": "In the past few years, however, things have become rather less serene, thanks to the almost 30 million visitors who descend each year on the city of just 50,000 inhabitants."}
{"original": "Before Covid-19 struck, tourists were arriving in often unmanageable numbers, choking the main streets and filling up the waterbuses. Authorities had tried various measures, from introducing separate residents' lines at major vaporetto (waterbus) stops to bringing in turnstiles that would filter locals from tourists on busy days. A planned entrance tax, due to debut in 2020, has been postponed to January 2022 , due to the pandemic."}
{"original": "But as well as controlling footfall, the authorities wanted to track tourism itself -- not just by registering overnight guests but, in a city where the vast majority of visitors are daytrippers, by counting exactly who is in the city -- and where they go."}
{"original": "The control room logs everything from water levels to the main routes people are taking around the city. Julia Buckley"}
{"original": "On the island of Tronchetto, next to the two-mile bridge separating Venice from the Italian mainland, the Control Room opened in September 2020.

{"original": "The building has offices for the mayor, other dignitaries, and a large CCTV room, with cameras feeding in images from around the city, watched over by the police."}
{"original": "Related content Venice to bring back entry fee for daytrippers to combat overtourism"}
{"original": "So far so normal. But then, across the corridor, there's the Smart Control Room -- another bank of screens with images and information coming live from around the lagoon. They're not being monitored for crime, though; they're feeding information to the authorities that will create a profile of the hordes of people visiting Venice. The hope is that gathering the information will not only track footfall now, enabling the authorities to activate turnstiles and start charging for entrance on busy days. Eventually, they hope that the data will help create a more sustainable tourism plan for the future."}
{"original": "A simulation of the main thoroughfares taken around the city. Julia Buckley"}
{"original": "This is the brain of the city, says Marco Bettini, co-director general of Venis , the Venice-based multimedia and tech company which built the system."}
{"original": "We know in real time how many people are in each part [of the city], and which countries they're from."}
{"original": "He clicks on the video feed from the Grand Canal -- the freeway of Venice, as he calls it -- to look at the traffic."}
{"original": "There's huge traffic pressure here, he says. Public waterbuses, boats delivering goods, taxis, residents zipping up the road in their own, private boats, and, of course, those famous gondolas -- they're all jostling for space on the Grand Canal. With no designated lanes, it can be a free-for-all."}
{"original": "But the new system not only records what's going on; it analyzes the traffic, recognizing the different types of boats, from gondola to a topo -- essentially a water-truck. It then stores the numbers. And it even tallies with the public transportation timetables, logging if a waterbus is late and, if so, by how many minutes."}
{"original": "Workers can also activate a time machine to look back -- so far today, for example, there have been more than 1,000 boats passing under the main bridge at Piazzale Roma, the main entry point to the city."}
{"original": "It's the pedestrian numbers, however, that are of more interest to the authorities looking at tourism patterns. The system not only counts visitors in the vicinity of cameras posted around the city, but it also, in conjunction with TIM (Telecom Italia, Italy's largest telecommunications provider), crunches who they are and where they come from."}
{"original": "On this winter day, before the Veneto region entered another semi-lockdown, for example, so far, 13,628 people have entered Venice, and 8,548 have left. In the hour after 7am, 1,688 people arrived at Piazzale Roma (the gateway to the city by road and tram) -- the commuters."}
{"original": "At 10am, the arrivals reached a peak of 2,411: most likely the daytrippers."}
{"original": "Tracking visitors by country and area"}
{"original": "The authorities hope that tracking visitors will help them understand better the flow of tourists. Julia Buckley"}
{"original": "The authorities can see where these new arrivals are from by analyzing their phone data (the information is all aggregated automatically, so no personal details can be gleaned)."}
{"original": "There are 97 people in the area around St Mark's Square on this Saturday afternoon, according to Bettini -- of which only 24 are not Italian."}
{"original": "And so far today there have been 955 people in the area, 428 of whom have come from abroad. Of the 527 Italians, only 246 are resident in Venice (if a mobile phone is regularly logged in the city, it is counted as a resident)."}
{"original": "As you can see, the number of daytrippers -- is steep, says Bettini. This is crucial information, because these hit-and-run tourists are usually charged with causing the most damage to the struggling city. They tend to come in from other parts of Italy -- often from beach resorts on a bad weather day -- and rarely spend money, bringing their own food and eating illicit picnics on bridges and on waterfronts. But since they don't stay overnight, they cannot be counted by the authorities -- until now."}
{"original": "Related content Venice holds back the water for first time in 1,200 years"}
{"original": "Counting the daytrippers and tracking where they tend to visit, and which streets they take, could be crucial for a city which has resorted to closing its main thoroughfares to non-locals at busy times in an attempt to spread people throughout the city."}
{"original": "As Valeria Duflot, co-founder of Venezia Autentica an online social enterprise working on sustainable tourism, says: The problem is not that Venice has too many visitors. The problem is that all the visitors go to the same two places: St Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge."}
{"original": "Working with a telephone operator, authorities can trace where those currently in the city are from. Julia Buckley"}
{"original": "Italians are logged by the region they live in. Of the foreigners, the system breaks down where they come from (data is based on where their mobile phone is registered, so most likely their country of origin), and displays them as bars on a map on the city -- a graphic representation of overcrowding in real time, with colors going from white to red as the numbers get higher."}
{"original": "Today, 36% of foreign visitors are German, followed by the Swiss (16%) and British (13% -- this visit took place before the new UK variant saw British travelers banned from Italy). Just 1.312% of visitors are from the United States -- although, given that American travelers are still banned from the European Union, it's a surprise it's even that much."}
{"original": "And today, there have been 85,000 people logged in Venice. A much greater number, 177,000, have been in Mestre, on the mainland. On the islands -- where places such as Burano and Murano are popular with tourists -- there are 5,700 people, this Saturday afternoon."}
{"original": "There's plenty more that the authorities are keeping tabs on: how fast people are moving in places like St Mark's Square (start running and the machine highlights you), the tide levels throughout the lagoon (crucial for monitoring acqua alta flooding, and determining when the new Mose flood barriers should be raised)."}
{"original": "The system took three years to build, at a cost of €3m ($3.5m). And although some might baulk at the privacy implications (although no personal data is recorded, you and your provenance is essentially being logged as you move around the city), the authorities are very proud."}
{"original": "Big bonuses are back at Deutsche Bank. Profit, meanwhile, remains elusive."}
{"original": "Germany's biggest bank said Friday in its annual report that it paid bonuses worth €2.3 billion ($2.8 billion) for 2017, in what it describes as a return to a system of normal compensation."}
{"original": "Deutsche Bank (DB), which has posted losses for the last three years, cut its 2016 bonus pool by 77% to €500 million ($616 million). It said then that the reduced payouts reflected the lender's financial performance at a time when jobs were being cut."}
{"original": "I recognize that this decision was highly contentious for many given the reported net loss in 2017, CEO John Cryan wrote in a letter to shareholders."}
{"original": "If we want to live up to our claim of being the leading European bank with a global network, we have to invest in our employees so that we can continue to provide the best solutions for our clients, he added."}

{"original": "Asked whether he would order a national lockdown to combat the coronavirus pandemic, Biden took a swipe at Sanders' Medicare for All proposal. He pointed to Italy, saying that its single-payer health care system hasn't worked to stem the outbreak there."}
{"original": "It has nothing to do with Medicare for All. That would not solve the problem at all, Biden said at CNN's Democratic Debate on Sunday night."}
{"original": "Facts First: This is partly true. As the experience of Italy and other countries shows, having universal coverage and a government-run health system is not enough on its own to stem the spread of coronavirus. But the US is at a disadvantage in fighting the coronavirus because tens of millions of Americans are uninsured or face high out-of-pocket costs before their insurance kicks in -- which may make people hesitant to seek testing or treatment."}
{"original": "Health care experts in the US are concerned that the coronavirus will spread more widely because ill Americans will avoid getting checked out because of the potential cost. Medicare for All calls for all Americans to have coverage with no out-of-pocket charges."}
{"original": "Nearly 28 million non-elderly people -- or 10.4% -- were uninsured in 2018, according to the US Census Bureau. And those who have insurance through their jobs still face annual deductibles of about $1,655, on average, before coverage kicks in, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation's Employer Health Benefits Survey."}
{"original": "Addressing coronavirus with tens of millions of people without health insurance or with inadequate insurance will be a uniquely American challenge among developed countries, tweeted Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at Kaiser. It will take money to treat people and address uncompensated care absorbed by providers."}
{"original": "But federal and state officials, as well as insurers, have stepped up to make sure that Americans can get the coronavirus test at no cost. Many insurers have said they will waive fees for certain members. Several states have also required insurers to waive the cost of the test for some policyholders."}
{"original": "The House bipartisan legislative package, which lawmakers passed in the early hours of Saturday morning, also calls for free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured, said Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a letter to House Democrats."}
{"original": "President Donald Trump has tweeted his support of the package. The Senate is expected to take up the measure when it returns to session this week."}
{"original": "Biden claimed the US chose not to take coronavirus tests from the WHO"}
{"original": "During the debate, Biden claimed that the US chose not to take testing kits for the coronavirus from the World Health Organization (WHO)."}
{"original": "Look, the World Health Organization offered the testing kits that they have available and to give it to us now, Biden said. We refused them. We did not want to buy them. We did not want to get them from them. We wanted to make sure we had our own."}
{"original": "Facts First: Biden's characterization that the WHO offered the US tests is incorrect."}
{"original": "Laboratories in Germany developed tests to detect the coronavirus which the WHO adopted and by last week, the WHO sent out tests to 120 countries. Other countries, like the US and China, chose to develop their own tests, according to the Washington Post"}
{"original": "As CNN reported Wednesday, no discussions occurred between the WHO and the CDC about providing tests to the United States, WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told CNN on Tuesday, and the WHO did not offer coronavirus tests to the CDC."}
{"original": "During a press conference Tuesday, administration officials were asked about Biden's comments during the debate. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, told reporters that organizations and groups can submit their testing kits through our regulatory processes, but without that and without a plan, we are not going to accept tests that have not been studied by us."}
{"original": "President Donald Trump, when asked Tuesday about Biden's comments, told reporters Biden made a mistake and assumed that he'll apologize."}
{"original": "Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, told CNN in response that Donald Trump cannot deflect responsibility for mishandling of the administration's response to the coronavirus outbreak. The United States lags far behind other countries in terms of having enough tests available for our citizens."}
{"original": "On February 12, the Center for Disease Control reported that some of the coronavirus test kits shipped to labs across the country were not working as they should."}
{"original": "As a result, the CDC remade parts of the test kits after some produced inconclusive test results."}
{"original": "As of Sunday , almost two months after the coronavirus was first detected in the US, 22,713 specimens had been tested in the US according to the CDC's website, where you can find daily updates here"}
{"original": "Experts have criticized the country's seeming inability to produce more tests."}
{"original": "Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one of the experts leading the administration's response to the coronavirus told Congress Thursday that the US was failing when it came to getting Americans tested."}
{"original": "It is a failing, let's admit it, Fauci said. The idea of anybody getting it easily, the way people in other countries are doing it, we're not set up for that."}
{"original": "CORRECTION: The Facts First finding on Biden's claim about the US and WHO testing kits was corrected after additional reporting that showed the WHO did not offer coronavirus tests to the CDC."}
{"original": "Biden claimed Sanders voted against 2008 auto bailout"}
{"original": "In an exchange about how the government bailed out banks during the 2008 financial crisis, Biden asserted that Sanders voted against a bailout for the auto industry."}
{"original": "Part of that was bailing out the automobile industry -- saving thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs over time. He voted against that, Biden said."}
{"original": "Sanders immediately rejected the claim, saying: No, I did not vote against that."}
{"original": "Facts First: Sanders is right, but this needs context. Sanders voted for a bill that would have bailed out the auto industry -- but it failed to pass the Senate. He voted against a different bailout measure, the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, which passed. That program released money to banks -- and a portion of that money eventually went to automakers."}
{"original": "In the midst of the financial crisis, the government bailed out failing banks to try to stabilize the economy. Automakers, facing cratering sales, were also headed towards insolvency and the government stepped in to rescue the industry and the jobs it provides."}
{"original": "Sanders did vote in December of 2008 to bring an auto bailout bill to the floor. But the motion failed and that particular piece of legislation never came to a full vote."}
{"original": "But Sanders voted against TARP, which was used to bail out the banks. When this measure was first proposed, there were no plans to use the money for the auto industry. But first President George W. Bush and then President Barack Obama used some of the TARP funds to bailout automakers."}
{"original": "Sanders claimed 'at least 30,000' and 'up to 60,000' people died due to inadequate health care"}
{"original": "Sanders on Sunday cited two figures about the number of people he claimed die because of the inadequacy of the US health care system."}
{"original": "Sanders said at least 30,000 people died in the US last year because they didn't get health care when they should have. He also said that up to 60,000 people die, in a good year, because they don't get to a doctor on time."}
{"original": "Facts First: The true number of Americans who die because they are uninsured or lack adequate coverage is not known. Some studies The true number of Americans who die because they are uninsured or lack adequate coverage is not known. Some studies suggest the number is in the tens of thousands per year, but other experts have expressed skepticism that the number is as high as Sanders says."}
{"original": "When CNN inquired in Februar y about a previous version of Sanders' claim about 30,000 deaths, the senator's campaign pointed to a new study in The Lancet medical journal that found ensuring health-care access for all Americans would save more than 68,000 lives...every year compared with the status quo."}
{"original": "But other experts have cast doubt on the findings of the study, noting that the estimate of more than 68,000 lives saved relied on an earlier paper -- from 2009, before the Affordable Care Act came into existence -- that arrived at a higher figure than other analyses have."}
{"original": "Biden made misleading claim on his past position on Iraq"}
{"original": "Biden during the debate was asked what lessons he learned from his 2002 vote to authorize war in Iraq, which he has called a mistake."}
{"original": "Biden, who was a US senator at the time of his vote, responded, I learned that I can't take the word of a President when in fact they assured me that they would not use force. Remember the context. The context was the United Nations Security Council was going to vote to insist that we allow inspectors into determining whether or not...they were, in fact, producing nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction. They were not."}
{"original": "Sanders responded, Everybody in the world knew that when you voted for that resolution you were giving (President George W.) Bush the authority to go to war. And everybody knew that's exactly what he and (Vice President Dick) Cheney wanted to do."}
{"original": "Facts First: Biden's claim is misleading by omission. Biden was Biden's claim is misleading by omission. Biden was an advocate of ending the Saddam Hussein regime for more than a year before the war began in 2003. While Biden did begin calling his 2002 vote a mistake in 2005 , he was a public supporter of the war in 2003 and 2004 -- and he made clear in 2002 and 2003, both before and after the war started, that he had known he was voting to authorize a possible war, not only to try to get inspectors into Iraq. It's also unclear whether Bush ever made Biden any kind of promise related to the use of force."}
{"original": "In a February 2003 speech in Delaware, before the war began, Biden said, Let everyone here be absolutely clear: I supported the resolution to go to war. I am NOT opposed to war to remove weapons of mass destruction from Iraq. I am NOT opposed to war to remove Saddam from those weapons if it comes to that. In a July 2003 speech at the Brookings Institution, after the war began, Biden said: Nine months ago, I voted with my colleagues to give the president of the United States of America the authority to use force and I would vote that way again today. It was the right vote then and would be a correct vote today."}
{"original": "You can read longer articles on Biden's claims about his stance on the Iraq war here here and here"}
{"original": "Bush denies ever having made Biden a promise not to go to war. After Biden made a version of this claim in 2019, saying Bush had made the pledge in an Oval Office meeting, a spokesman for Bush told NPR , I'm sure it's just an innocent mistake of memory, but this recollection is flat wrong."}
{"original": "It's true that Biden criticized Bush's approach to diplomacy in the lead-up to the war, that Biden warned in the lead-up to the war that Bush was not being honest about how hard the war would be, and that he criticized Bush's handling of the war from its first weeks on. But, again, Biden made clear that he supported the war despite that criticism."}
{"original": "Biden claimed there's been only a 'marginal change' in Chinese wealth in recent decades"}
{"original": "During an exchange about Sanders' views on authoritarian countries, Biden claimed that China's income gains have been marginal."}
{"original": "China is undoubtedly an authoritarian society, OK. But would anybody deny, any economist deny that extreme poverty in China today is much less than what it was 40 or 50 years ago? That's a fact, Sanders said."}
{"original": "The idea that they, in fact, have increased the wealth of people in that country, it's been marginal the change that has taken place, Biden responded."}
{"original": "Facts First: This is false. China has seen a significant upswing in terms of standard of living over the past two decades -- though the country still significantly lags the US and extreme poverty remains a reality for many."}
{"original": "One way to measure standard of living is through a country's gross domestic product per capita at purchasing power parity. In other words, looking at a country's GDP per person in international dollars, a hypothetical currency used to measure purchasing parity between different countries."}
{"original": "For China, that measure has increased to $18,237 per capita in 2018 from $2,936 in 2000, and $988 in 1990, according to data from the World Bank."}
{"original": "However, China is still far from wealthy relative to the US, where GDP per capita at purchasing power parity stood at around $62,795 in 2018."}
{"original": "Sanders claimed Biden supported proposed Social Security cuts"}
{"original": "In an exchange on Social Security, Biden denied Sanders' claim that Biden talked about the necessity with pride about cutting social security, cutting Medicare, cutting veterans programs."}
{"original": "Fact First: This Sanders' claim needs a lot of context. Biden did repeatedly support freezes in Social Security spending and at times called for raising the retirement age. In 2011, he said changes would have to be made to entitlements, saying they wouldn't be sustainable -- but he didn't specify what changes. Overall, the claim leaves out that Biden was typically talking about any changes to entitlements in the context of a broader legislative package."}
{"original": "Sanders and Biden's exchanges on Social Security have been covered by fact checkers before from the Washington Post Politifact , and FactCheck.org."}
{"original": "Biden did at least twice discuss raising the retirement age throughout his career as a senator. And throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Biden supported freezes in Social Security spending during budget reduction negotiations."}
{"original": "And comments Biden made during a 1995 speech on the Senate floor show he was willing to make cuts to Medicare, but only as part of a broader deal that did not advocate cuts as big as Republicans want."}
{"original": "You guys want a balanced budget in 7 years, and you want CBO numbers. I want a balanced budget, too, but I do not want to cut as much Medicare as you do. I do not want to cut as much as you do, and I do not want to give as big a tax break as you want.''"}
{"original": "Sanders also defended himself tonight when asked by CNN's moderators about 1996 comments he made, first reported by the Associated Press , where he wrote in an op-ed we will have to make incremental adjustments in Social Security taxes and benefits — as Congress has done in the past."}
{"original": "Sanders said Sunday he never supported cuts to Social Security and in the same op-ed he did say he opposed proposed cuts by the Republican-led Congress to entitlement programs."}
{"original": "In multiple op-eds and press releases from 1997 , Sanders made clear he opposed any cuts to Social Security. The adjustment Sanders was discussing was making the tax system more progressive."}
{"original": "If we are serious about saving Social Security, not raising taxes on the middle class, and not cutting back on benefits desperately needed by many senior citizens, we must adjust this artificial ceiling on Social Security taxes and make the Social Security tax more progressive."}
{"original": "Biden claimed he opposed the Hyde Amendment 'a while ago'"}
{"original": "Sanders confronted Biden about his long history of support for the Hyde Amendment, which prevents federal funds from being used for abortion except in cases of rape, incest or where there is a danger to the life of the mother."}
{"original": "Biden responded that he affirmatively came out and opposed the Hyde Amendment -- and did that a while ago, okay?"}
{"original": "Facts First: Biden Biden reversed his position on the amendment less than a year ago, in June 2019, so the accuracy of the claim depends on your definition of a while ago."}
{"original": "Biden said upon his June 2019 reversal that he made no apologies for his past support of the amendment. He argued that times have changed, since, he argued , the right to choose was not under attack as it is now from Republicans and since women's rights and women's health are under assault like we haven't seen in the last 50 years."}
{"original": "He also said that he had decided he could not simultaneously put forward a health care plan to give people the option to sign on to a federally funded health insurance program while he also continued to support an amendment that would deny abortion using federal funds."}
{"original": "Sanders and Biden had a heated exchange about super PACs. Sanders claimed a super PAC tied to Biden is running very ugly negative ads against him, while Biden argued that Sanders has nine super PACs working on his behalf."}
{"original": "Facts First: While it's unclear which ad Sanders was referring to, at least one super PAC connected to Biden, Unite the Country, ran a large television ad campaign that implicitly criticized Sanders without mentioning him by name.."}
{"original": "As for Biden's claim about Sanders' nine super PACs, Sanders does have the backing of a network of progressive groups, which includes nine organizations that are part of the People Power for Bernie coalition, as The Washington Post recently has reported"}
{"original": "But most groups supporting Sanders are not super PACs, instead operating as politically active non-profits."}
{"original": "After decrying super PACs in the past, Biden reversed his position last October as he struggled to raise money for the 2020 campaign, and embraced help from Unite the Country, which has spent more than $10 million to help him."}
{"original": "Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group (CMAG) data shows that Unite the Country has spent more than $1.1 million on a 30-second ad called, A Democrat, that takes some digs at Sanders without mentioning him by name."}
{"original": "For instance, it includes a clip from a Biden speech, in which Biden says Democrats want a nominee who's a Democrat -- an apparent challenge to the party bonafides of Sanders, who serves as an independent in the US Senate and describes himself as a democratic socialist."}
{"original": "As for Sanders, he does have the support a super PAC affiliated with National Nurses United, which has spent about $750,000 so far, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics."}
{"original": "When Sanders asked Biden to name the nine super PACs in question, the former vice president responded: Come on. Give me a break."}
{"original": "Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN) Michael Bloomberg 's billions got him onto the debate stage -- but did nothing to spare him from the barrage he faced Wednesday night here in Las Vegas ."}
{"original": "In the most fiery and contentious Democratic primary debate yet , Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren led a non-stop barrage against the former New York City mayor who was appearing on stage for the first time. She kicked it off by calling him an arrogant billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse faced lesbians."}
{"original": "Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar accused Bloomberg of hiding behind his TV ads. Former Vice President Joe Biden hammered him for opposing Obamacare. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders attacked Bloomberg's support for stop-and-frisk policing in his first answer of the night. Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg called him a billionaire who thinks that money ought to be the root of all power."}
{"original": "The pile-on against Bloomberg came three days before the Nevada caucuses, as candidates trailing Sanders and with nowhere near Bloomberg's money are desperate to prove they deserve to remain in the race as it narrows."}
{"original": "Here are six takeaways from the ninth Democratic presidential debate:"}
{"original": "Bloomberg arrives for the ninth Democratic primary debate"}
{"original": "Democratic voters have been laser-focused on electability -- and Bloomberg's willingness to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising campaign had lent him the perception of it in recent weeks, as he's jumped into double digits in national polls. That perception might have been shattered Wednesday night."}
{"original": "Bloomberg had answers for none of the criticism about his previous support for stop-and-frisk policing, his opposition to Obamacare, offensive remarks about women or why he hasn't yet released his tax returns."}
{"original": "His worst moment came when Warren and Biden challenged him to release women who alleged sexism and misogynistic behavior by Bloomberg and at his company from non-disclosure agreements. Warren said those women were being muzzled and that the drip, drip, drip of stories of women saying they have been harassed and discriminated against would be a massive liability in a general election."}
{"original": "But Bloomberg didn't address any of their criticisms, and wouldn't budge."}
{"original": "None of them accuse me of doing anything other than, maybe they didn't like a joke I told, Bloomberg said."}
{"original": "I'm simply not going to end these agreements because they were made consensually and they have every right to expect they will stay private, he added."}
{"original": "Warren lights the stage on fire"}
{"original": "Warren gestures as she speaks during the ninth Democratic primary debate"}
{"original": "Desperate for a return to the spotlight after disappointing finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, Warren installed herself as the leading attacker in the debate's opening minutes. She eviscerated Bloomberg's deflection on a question about allegations of misogynistic behavior at his company after he highlighted female executives there and at his philanthropy."}
{"original": "I hope you heard what his defense was: I've been nice to some women, she said. That just doesn't cut it."}
{"original": "And while Bloomberg got the worst of it, Warren spent the whole night on offense."}
{"original": "In a single, memorable answer, Warren lambasted three of her opponents' health care plans. She called Buttigieg's proposal a slogan that was thought up by his consultants. Klobuchar's, she said, was like a Post-It note. And she said Sanders' Medicare for All plan -- which Warren largely backs -- is hurt because his campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question or tries to fill in details about how to actually make this work."}
{"original": "Sanders speaks between Warren and Biden during the Democratic presidential primary debate."}
{"original": "For the first time in this long primary campaign, Sanders took the debate stage as its national front-runner. But unlike others who have held that unofficial mantle, and carried the target that comes with it, Sanders emerged from the experience mostly unscathed."}
{"original": "The Vermont senator faced familiar lines of attack -- that his democratic socialism makes him unelectable and that his Medicare for All plan is unpractical -- but Bloomberg's presence altered the dynamics of the debate enough that Sanders was able to stick to his message and avoid being dragged into deeper waters by his rivals."}
{"original": "Bloomberg also gave Sanders a fresh target: a real, live billionaire onstage to hammer when he spoke about income inequality."}
{"original": "Mike Bloomberg owns more wealth than the bottom 125 million Americans, Sanders said at one point. That's wrong, that's immoral, that should not be the case when we got a half a million people sleeping out on the streets, when we kids who cannot afford to go to college, when we have 45 million people dealing with student debt."}
{"original": "Buttigieg urges Democrats to 'wake up'"}
{"original": "Buttigieg speaks during the Democratic presidential primary debate"}
{"original": "Buttigieg came into the debate focused on denting the front-runner, Sanders, while offering himself as a cogent moderate alternative to Bloomberg. And in moments, he was able to do that -- calling on Sanders to accept some responsibility for the virulent comments his supporters have made online and calling the Vermont senator a socialist who thinks that capitalism is the root of all evil."}
{"original": "But the mayor's debate performance was also defined by attacks leveled against him from across the stage, primarily by Klobuchar -- who mockingly quipped she wished everyone was as perfect as you, Pete."}
{"original": "Buttigieg's strategy of largely avoiding Bloomberg, who drew most of the fire on the debate stage, was clear. But just as apparent was how Buttigieg, despite leading the national delegate count after two states have voted, was searching for a moment that propels him forward as the Democratic race for president goes national."}
{"original": "We've got to wake up as a party, Buttigieg said. We could wake up two weeks from today, the day after Super Tuesday, and the only candidates left standing will be Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg."}
{"original": "Klobuchar speaks during a Democratic presidential primary debate"}
{"original": "Klobuchar has turned in a series of strong debate performances throughout her presidential run -- usually happy-warrior performances with jokes sprinkled in. But Wednesday's was singular for another reason: The contempt she showed for Buttigieg and the frustration she has for Warren."}
{"original": "Klobuchar, at different points throughout the debate, turned to her left to take on Buttigieg with a fire that she hadn't previously shown on the debate stage. She accused the former mayor of calling her dumb and suggested that his entire candidacy was based on him memorizing a bunch of talking points."}
{"original": "And when Warren hit Klobuchar for wanting to work with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Minnesota senator tersely said, I am willing to work with people and find common ground and that's what we want in a president, Elizabeth."}
{"original": "There is no love lost between Buttigieg and Klobuchar -- a reality that was clear headed into the debate. And Klobuchar showed she believes Warren's style of leadership is divisive. But her fiery performance in Las Vegas was a divergence from the approach that had worked so well for her in New Hampshire -- and highlighted how desperately she needs a memorable moment to keep her campaign going as the pace of primaries ramps up."}
{"original": "The stage is set for a contentious convention"}
{"original": "With such a crowded field, there is a real possibility that Democrats will go to their summer convention in Milwaukee with none of the candidates having clinched the nomination."}
{"original": "For five of the six candidates onstage, the answer was to roll the dice, perhaps allow superdelegates in on a second ballot and, as a couple put it, let the process play out. Bloomberg, Warren, Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar all said that a candidate with a plurality of delegates should not automatically be handed the nomination."}
{"original": "Sanders, who could very well find himself in that position, was the lone voice of dissent. He said that the campaign with the most delegates, even if it fails to collect an outright majority, should win the nomination."}
{"original": "If what many Democrats consider a doomsday scenario occurs, and none of the hopefuls secure enough support to win the nomination on a first ballot, the contest could hinge on the preferences of nearly 800 superdelegates. And that, as anyone who remembers the controversy surrounding their impact in 2016 will recall, could be a recipe for an intra-party meltdown that would make the tough primary of four years ago look like tame."}
{"original": "New York (CNN Business) Lured by his promises of fat tax cuts and deregulation, Corporate America enthusiastically backed President Donald Trump following his shocking 2016 victory."}
{"original": "But the relationship broke down as Trump failed to condemn racism, attacked major American companies, ignored the climate crisis and imposed tariffs. And the divorce was completed in spectacular fashion this week after Trump incited an angry mob that assaulted the US Capitol."}
{"original": "When Trump took office, the business community initially praised the self-styled CEO president's pro-business agenda : In late 2016, the influential lobbying group Business Roundtable cheered Trump's economic team and tax cut promises. The following year Jay Timmons, CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers, urged lawmakers to back Trump's infrastructure plan and said all of Congress needs to get onboard the 'Trump train."}
{"original": "Both parties struck an entirely different tone this week with the insurrection on the US Capitol, a symbol of American democracy, proving to be the final straw."}
{"original": "The Business Roundtable slammed US politicians for spreading the fiction of a fraudulent election, warning it's a threat to democracy and the economy. Leading CEOs condemned the violence."}
{"original": "And in perhaps the strongest political statement by a major business group in modern history, Timmons -- a former GOP operative -- called on Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet to consider removing Trump from power : This is chaos. It is mob rule. It is dangerous. This is sedition and it should be treated as such."}
{"original": "But critics say business leaders should have condemned Trumpism far earlier and in some ways enabled him."}
{"original": "This is a lesson in not standing up to bullies, said Eleanor Bloxham, CEO of the Value Alliance, a firm that advises boards on corporate governance practices. By embracing Trump, they were enabling a very narrow perspective, not a long-term one."}
{"original": "Senator Sherrod Brown, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, suggested the timing of the divorce was convenient."}
{"original": "These CEOs have already gotten their tax cuts, deregulation and pro-corporate judges. They don't really need Trump anymore, so they can finally do the right thing, Brown told CNN Business in an interview on Thursday. It's nice they stepped up with such great courage with 13 days left in the Trump administration."}
{"original": "These CEOs have already gotten their tax cuts, deregulation and pro-corporate judges. They don't really need Trump anymore, so they can finally do the right thing. Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown"}
{"original": "To be fair, the relationship between Trump and Corporate America has always been full of ups and downs. And CEOs did provide critical moments of moral leadership during the turbulent Trump era."}
{"original": "In the primaries, the feeling seemed to be, 'Oh no, Trump,' Bloxham recalled of her conversations in 2015 and 2016 with generally Republican-leaning board members."}
{"original": "After Trump won the nomination, many business leaders threw their weight behind Hillary Clinton."}
{"original": "They never saw him as one of them, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, founder of Yale University's Chief Executive Leadership Institute. Sonnenfeld recalled that some executives who are active CEOs today threatened to walk out when he brought Trump to a business summit around 2006."}
{"original": "But once Trump won the White House, the industry saw him as a vehicle for the pro-business agenda they craved -- especially on tax cuts."}
{"original": "In January 2017, there was great enthusiasm. He was speaking their language, said Sonnenfeld. The business community was quite excited."}
{"original": "By the end of 2017, Trump delivered by enacting sweeping corporate tax cuts that the White House promised would create a roaring economy."}
{"original": "The Business Roundtable did a deal with the devil, said Sonnenfeld."}
{"original": "Trump's tax cuts had a greater impact on Wall Street than Main Street. A lasting acceleration in job-creating investments never materialized, with the windfall largely going toward stock buybacks, dividends and mergers. By early 2019, Bank of America economists dubbed it the investment boom that wasn't."}
{"original": "Beyond tax cuts, Trump set in motion a wave of deregulation that the business community was clamoring for after eight years of the Obama administration. And he appointed pro-business judges, including three conservatives to the Supreme Court."}
{"original": "They got most of what they wanted, said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James."}

{"original": "But relations began to fray in the summer of 2017."}

{"original": "They didn't want to be on the wrong side of history, said Sonnenfeld."}
{"original": "The question now is whether business leaders will offer support to the Trump movement after his term ends January 20."}
{"original": "Trump and his surrogates have vowed to mount well-funded primary challenges to sitting Republicans who refused to back his attempt to overturn the election."}
{"original": "You've got a lot of Republican businessmen wondering: Am I going to latch onto this Trump movement because it's still low-tax and pro-energy? said Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management in an interview conducted before Wednesday's siege on the Capitol."}
{"original": "On the other hand, there is a lot of other stuff that goes with the Trump movement: anti-trade, intensely anti-immigration and arguably a degree of authoritarianism that isn't in sync with the party, he added."}
{"original": "Bloxham, the Value Alliance CEO, said much will depend on whether Trump faces serious consequences, such as impeachment or invocation of the 25th Amendment, before his term ends."}
{"original": "If there is a strong response, Bloxham said, then the Trump brand will be much more toxic."}

{"original": "The US national debt stood at $21.974 trillion at the end of 2018, more than $2 trillion higher than when President Donald Trump took office, according to numbers released Thursday by the Treasury Department."}
{"original": "The national debt has been rising at an accelerated rate in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when Congress and the Obama administration approved stimulus funding in order to keep the economy afloat."}
{"original": "The debt began to level off at the beginning of Trump's term, but bounced up again last year as the tax cuts passed at the end of 2017 took effect and the dramatically lower corporate tax rate lowered Treasury revenues."}
{"original": "As a candidate, Trump promised to get rid of the national debt, telling the Washington Post in 2016 that he could make the US debt-free over a period of eight years."}
{"original": "According to the Congressional Budget Office, total public debt stood at 78% of America's gross domestic product in fiscal year 2018, the highest percentage since 1950. The deficit – or the difference between what the government spends and what it takes in over any one year – jumped to 3.8% of GDP in 2018, up from 3.5% in 2017."}
{"original": "That's particularly unusual in such a strong economy without major new expenditures. If no changes are made, the CBO projects that public debt will rise to 96% of GDP by 2028. A big chunk of that – $1.9 trillion between 2018 and 2028 – will be due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the CBO reported last April."}
{"original": "Asked about the rising debt on Thursday morning, Council of Economic Advisers chairman Kevin Hassett said Trump is absolutely concerned about it, which is why he demanded a 5% budget cut from each Cabinet agency for the coming budget cycle."}
{"original": "We can disagree about a lot of things but we can agree maybe now is the time to get serious about the deficit, Hassett said."}
{"original": "A congressionally-imposed cap on national debt kicks back in on March 2. According to an analysis by the Bipartisan Policy Center, the Treasury will be able to finance the government's operations until at least mid-summer by moving money around from different pots."}
{"original": "Although cryptocurrencies are nothing new, 2017 saw more mainstream investors buying in — and cashing out."}
{"original": "Now they could be staring down some major tax liabilities. But how tax laws apply to virtual currencies like bitcoin and ethereum is still a gray area that confuses people."}
{"original": "I think a lot of people who got in to cryptocurrency maybe didn't even think about the tax implications, says Janna Herron, a tax researcher and writer at Value Penguin."}
{"original": "The Internal Revenue Service says virtual currency transactions are taxable by law. The agency issued its first and only guidance on how tax principles apply to transactions using cryptocurrency in 2014."}
{"original": "The one notice is considered tax authority, says Sarah-Jane Morin, an attorney in the tax practice group at Morgan Lewis. It isn't as binding as regulations, but it is all we have to go on."}
{"original": "The guidance says that for tax purposes, cryptocurrencies should be treated as property, not currency. And cryptocurrencies, in this guidance, include anything that is considered a convertible virtual currency, which means it has an equivalent value in real currency or acts as a substitute for real currency. Not all cryptocurrencies act this way, but most of the major ones, like bitcoin, do."}
{"original": "Some people with bitcoin may think of it as dollars or cash, says Morin. But for IRS purposes it should be treated as a house, stocks, bonds. You have to look at the general tax principles that apply to property and how it impacts your gains or losses."}
{"original": "Basically, if you bought bitcoin and haven't sold, you haven't realized any gain. You probably don't have any reporting obligations."}
{"original": "But if you sold bitcoin — or any other cryptocurrency — in the last year, you'll need to report the gains and losses. Here's how."}
{"original": "Usually on sales of stocks or bonds, your brokerage firm or bank will send you a 1099 tax form, says Herron. That's not the case for all crytpo-exchanges or most transactions."}
{"original": "Coinbase will only issue the statement if you've realized $20,000 in gains and had at least 200 transactions."}
{"original": "It is a high bar designed for major players, not your casual investor who wandered into bitcoin recently."}
{"original": "What that means is the onus is on you to figure out the tax obligations, says Herron."}
{"original": "Since the IRS determines cryptocurrencies to be property, like stocks or real estate, you'll need to pay taxes if you've realized a capital gain and you can lower your tax bill if you've taken a loss."}
{"original": "You'll need to gather the following information: 1) when you bought the crypto, 2) how much you paid for it, 3) when you sold it, and 4) what you received for it."}
{"original": "I don't think the average person realizes that they needed to track their basis, says Morin, which is the original value of an asset for tax purposes."}
{"original": "Usually the basis is the the purchase price, but it is adjusted for things like splits, dividends and return of capital distributions. You'll need the basis to determine the capital gain, or the difference between the asset's cost basis and the current market value."}
{"original": "This can become very confusing if you made various purchases at different times. Generally, you want to apply a first in, first out principal, says Morin."}
{"original": "Alternatively, you could use websites aimed at helping bitcoin investors determine their tax liabilities. Bitcoin.tax and Cointracking.info will help you figure out your transaction history, how much you owe and how to fill out the Schedule D (1040) form for reporting capital gains or losses."}
{"original": "It may occur to you that if no one is reporting your captial gains to the IRS, no one really knows about your investments."}
{"original": "It is never a good idea to try to skip out on your taxes, says Herron. You really don't want to hide anything from the IRS. In the future they may discover that you owe, there will be penalties and fines involved in that."}
{"original": "Even though the notice on cryptocurrencies is guidance and not regulation, it does comment on penalties."}
{"original": "It says that taxpayers may be subject to penalties for not reporting, says Morin. The best way to avoid penalties is to do the best you can with the reporting. That will show that you didn't have a willful intent to avoid taxes."}
{"original": "In some extreme situations, taxpayers could be subject to criminal prosecution for failing to properly report the income tax consequences of virtual currency transactions, the IRS said in a statement released Friday."}
{"original": "And the penalties are steep: anyone convicted of tax evasion, for example, is subject to a prison term of up to 5 years and a fine of up to $250,000."}
{"original": "This year you may be stuck with a suboptimal situation in which you're looking through receipts and statements and emails trying to get all your information together."}
{"original": "Going forward, it would probably be easier to keep detailed records of what you bought and when you bought it, Morin says."}
{"original": "In addition to keeping records of your virtual currency transactions, it's a good idea to set aside money each time you make a taxable trade to compensate for the tax associated with that transaction."}
{"original": "No one is going to tell you to do it, but you'll be responsible for the consequences if you don't."}
{"original": "Go with the idea that it will be up to you and you need to keep those records to stay on the right side of Uncle Sam, says Herron."}

{"original": "On Thursday, we learned that Michael Cohen, President Trump's former personal lawyer, is scheduled to testify publicly on February 7 before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform."}
{"original": "PHOTO: Courtesy Jennifer Rodgers Jennifer Rodgers"}
{"original": "While Cohen did not provide any details about the subjects of his testimony, saying only that he wanted to cooperate and provide the American people with answers by providing a full and credible account of the events which have transpired, there are at least three avenues of inquiry that could be pursued by committee members or volunteered by Cohen that could potentially cause President Trump and his three eldest children a whole heap of trouble."}
{"original": "None of these likely areas relates to topics in the heartland of Mueller's Russia probe, which will be handled by a different committee, likely in secret session, because of the ongoing nature of that investigation. So we likely won't be hearing additional details about the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations, the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, and Cohen's role and knowledge of negotiations about the so-called Ukrainian peace plan."}
{"original": "But we will likely hear a lot more than we now know about the hush-money payments made by Cohen at Trump's behest to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal to buy their silence in the run-up to the 2016 election."}
{"original": "To date, Cohen has said only that Trump directed him to make the payments and that he made the payments for the principal purpose of influencing the election. I expect that we will hear much more specific testimony about how Trump ordered Cohen to pay off these women in exchange for their silence, and Trump's comments establishing the reason behind the payoffs. And we also are likely to learn who else was in on the scheme, both at the Trump Organization and in the campaign."}
{"original": "All of this information is important because it provides the evidence behind the accusation that Trump was involved. First, Cohen may identify other witnesses to Trump's actions in addition to the two we know have already received immunity for their testimony, namely Allen Weisselberg, Trump Organization CFO, and David Pecker, CEO of AMI, the media company involved in the McDougal payoff."}
{"original": "Cohen may also reveal the existence of other corroborating evidence in addition to what we already know, like the tape recording he famously made of his and Trump's conversations. So, on February 7 we should all have a much fuller picture of the evidence to support the notion that President Trump has committed a felony campaign finance offense. Trump has denied violating the law, though his version of events has changed repeatedly and dramatically since the payoff allegations surfaced."}
{"original": "Second, there is a whole category of evidence that Cohen could provide to Congress regarding possible wrongdoing at the Trump Organization which could spell trouble not only for Trump, but for three of his children who are or have been Trump Organization executives."}
{"original": "Cohen is in the position, having been a high-level Trump Organization executive for 10 years, acting as a lawyer and a fixer, to provide testimony about a whole host of areas, to include tax and accounting matters, issues relating to immigration (note the recent reporting that Trump employees at a New Jersey golf property allegedly provided false documents to illegal workers) and more."}
{"original": "To be clear, there is not currently in the public realm solid proof of misconduct along these lines by Trump Organization officials, but to the extent such misconduct has occurred, Cohen would almost certainly know about it. President Trump's claims otherwise, for example his statement that Cohen did very low-level work at the Trump Organization, are inconsistent with Cohen's longevity and role in the organization, and with his significant access to Trump."}
{"original": "That said, there are two possible reasons why Cohen may not testify about Trump Organization misdeeds on February 7. It appears that, at least as of the date of his sentencing in December, Cohen refused to cooperate on matters other than the campaign finance crimes with prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, according to SDNY's sentencing submission. This would presumably include information related to potential criminal conduct at the Trump Organization aside from the campaign finance crime."}
{"original": "If the reason for this is that describing such conduct exposes Cohen to additional criminal liability, he may refuse to answer questions about it. There is also a less likely scenario under which Cohen has since sentencing decided to cooperate with an SDNY investigation into the Trump Organization, and that SDNY has asked him not to discuss this ongoing investigation in a public setting."}
{"original": "A final way in which Cohen's testimony could be valuable is in adding evidence to civil actions that are ongoing or anticipated. He may provide more public information on the alleged violations of law committed by the Trump Foundation, currently the subject of a civil action by the New York Attorney General as well as the factual basis for numerous suspected conflicts of interest."}

{"original": "In that regard, good government watchdogs have been concerned since the election about Trump making policy decisions to benefit his company, but there has been very little transparency about the details of deals or prospective deals in places like Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Information on what deals the Trump Organization was pursuing in these countries could be very enlightening and helpful to the state attorneys general and good government groups seeking to shine a light on these potential conflicts. Cohen should know; he was still working for Trump, according to Trump, as recently as April 2018."}
{"original": "So, despite President Trump's claim to the contrary Thursday, there is a lot for him — and his three eldest children who were Trump Organization executives at the relevant times — to be worried about when Cohen testifies on February 7."}

{"original": "The stock market is certainly not the best indicator of the economy's health, or of a president's track record. But throughout his four years in office, it clearly was President Donald Trump's favorite metric. He often tweeted in all caps about ALL TIME HIGHS!!! for stocks, even as the country grappled with surging coronavirus cases and high unemployment during the pandemic. Now, as he wraps up his last day in the White House, where does Trump's beloved stock market stand? As of Tuesday's market close, the S&P 500 was up 67% since his Inauguration Day in 2017. Here's how that performance stacks up to stocks at the same point in other modern presidencies (1,006 trading days, to be exact): Stocks were up 83% at this point in Barack Obama's presidency, amid the recovery from the Great Recession. They were much weaker under George W. Bush, down about 13% because of the September 11th attacks and the dot-com bust. Stocks were up 75% four years into Bill Clinton's presidency, and 25% into Ronald Reagan's. Meanwhile, President George H.W. Bush, who also failed to win reelection, ended his four years with stocks up around 50%. Unlike his predecessor, incoming President-elect Joe Biden does not put nearly as much emphasis on stocks as a gauge of the country's strength or wellbeing. The idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what's happening, Biden said of Trump in the final presidential debate in October."}

{"original": "Diana Walker/Time Life Pictures/Getty Images Ronald Reagan President Ronald Reagan's first four years in the White House weren't particularly lucrative for Wall Street. Crushed by Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker's war on inflation, the economy stumbled into a brief recession in July 1981. Unemployment spiked to nearly 11%. But Volcker's rate hikes and Reagan's corporate tax cuts eventually broke the back of inflation, setting the stage for rapid economic growth. Under Reagan, America drastically ramped up defense spending in a successful bid to bring down the Soviet Union. Despite the strong economy, Wall Street suffered its worst day ever under Reagan. The Dow plunged an astonishing 22.6% on Black Monday — equaling about 5,500 points today. Nonetheless, the S&P 500 posted five separate years of double-digit growth on the Gipper's watch, including a 26% spike in 1985. 1st term +30% Jan. 20, 1981 – Jan. 20, 1985 2nd term +67% Jan. 20, 1985 – Jan. 20, 1989"}

The era was punctuated by the dotcom boom, which amounted to the creation of an entirely new industry. The Nasdaq spiked sevenfold between 1993 and its peak in early 2000.

Let me read you part, quote, A responsible whistleblower makes all Americans safer by ensuring that serious wrongdoing can be investigated and addressed thus advancing the case -- the cause of national security to which we have devoted our careers."}

And that really undercuts the Republican talking point we have heard up here on Capitol Hill, Poppy, that this person, this first whistleblower did not have firsthand knowledge of the phone call that has now become the centerpiece of Democrats' impeachment inquiry. So one of the biggest points about this new whistleblower, of course, is that this person did have firsthand knowledge. Of course, they are working through the whistleblower protection system.

{"original": "JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Right. Well, the bottom line from Stephanie Grisham over here at the White House is that the president did nothing wrong, so it doesn't matter how many whistleblowers there are out there. But also important to say the president tweeted just this morning once again, discrediting this second whistleblower. You know he has a history of that, it goes all the way back even before Robert Mueller who he went after with a vengeance. The president this morning writing, The partisan whistleblower, apparently referring to the first whistleblower to come forward, was very wrong. The president writes what his, quote, perfect no pressure call with the Ukrainian president was and then apparently referring to the second person, he writes, Bring in another whistleblower from the bench."}
{"original": "So now you got the president once again going after the first whistleblower, the second whistleblower. We don't know any of their names at all and we can certainly expect this to continue over the weekend as well. The president also referring to an attorney for the whistleblowers as the same for both, and also indicating that that person is a Democrat supporting both Hillary Clinton and Obama. That's apparently -- apparently a reference to attorney Andrew Bakaj who in fact was an intern for Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer, the two New York senators back in 2001. Back to you."}
{"original": "HARLOW: All right. Joe Johns, thank you very much for laying all of that out."}
{"original": "SCIUTTO: Well, 90 former National Security officials who we should note worked for both Republican and Democratic administrations have come together, signed an open letter in support of the first whistleblower. That letter says, and we're quoting, Simply put, he or she has done what our law demands. Now he or she deserves our protection."}
{"original": "Former director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, is one of the officials who signed that letter. He joins me now live from Washington."}
{"original": "Director Clapper, tell us why you and these other officials felt the need to come out publicly in support of this whistleblower's right here."}
{"original": "JAMES CLAPPER, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, Jim, I think it stems first with my involvement with the intelligence community whistleblower protection program when I served as director of National Intelligence and I was a strong proponent of it for the simple reason that people in the intelligence community must have, should have a legitimate conduit for expressing concerns about wrongdoing and be able to do it in such a way that they are protected and the information they are conveying is protected."}
{"original": "So when I was approached about signing such a letter, open letter to the public, about the importance of whistleblowers and the importance of protecting them, I signed on in a heartbeat."}
{"original": "SCIUTTO: That's right. As you know, the president has called for this whistleblower to be outed and you've heard it from some of the president's surrogates, Senator Lindsey Graham as well, and I want to play a short comment from him on FOX News and then ask you a question. Have a listen."}
{"original": "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): If the whistleblower's allegations are turned into an impeachment article, it's imperative that the whistleblower be interviewed in public under oath and cross examined. Nobody in America goes to jail or has anything done to them without confronting their accuser. This is Kavanaugh all over again."}
{"original": "SCIUTTO: Now Senator Graham, as well as you and I, know that the whistleblower law is designed expressly to protect the identity of whistleblowers so they feel secure in coming and exposing the possibility of wrongdoing."}
{"original": "Do you see a deliberate effort here by the president and his supporters to discourage future whistleblowers? To make it clear to them that there will be public consequences if they come forward?"}
{"original": "CLAPPER: Well, yes, absolutely. I think, in fact, the statements such as Senator Graham's and certainly the president's about outing the whistleblower is I think casts -- creates a chilling effect on others to come forward if, in fact, the law is going to be summarily violated. I think that would cause others to pause about coming forward. Now it appears that may not have applied here, which is a good thing in the case of this second whistleblower complainant."}
{"original": "SCIUTTO: As you know, the president now has sitting members of this government. You have the attorney general, traveling the world now, meeting with U.S. intelligence partners, trying to find out in his view whether they participated in some sort of Obama administration- led effort to undermine President Trump in the last election here. You also know that John Durham, who is a former prosecutor, senior Justice Department official, he's pursuing his own investigation on the origins of that probe."}
{"original": "Are you concerned that Barr's or Durham's investigation will find wrongdoing and seek to punish former intelligence officials?"}
{"original": "CLAPPER: Well, I don't -- I don't know. I don't think there was any wrongdoing. I think at the time all of us were trying to navigate a very, very difficult, politically fraught, highly charged situation. I know from my part my main concern was -- were the Russians and the threat posed by the Russians to our very political fabric. And the message I'm getting from all this is, apparently what we were supposed to have done was to ignore the Russian interference, ignore the Russian meddling and the threat that it poses to us, and oh, by the way, mulling off what the then commander-in-chief, President Obama, told us to do, which was to assemble all the reporting that we could, that we had available to us, and put it in one report that the president could pass on to the Congress and to the next administration, and while we're at it, declassify as much as we possibly could to make it public and that's what we did. And --"}
{"original": "CLAPPER: It's kind of disconcerting now to be investigated for, you know, having done our duty and done what we were told to do by the president."}
{"original": "SCIUTTO: Fair enough. And as you know we're just a little more than a year away from another election which the intelligence community is concerned, and others, Republicans and Democrats concerned that Russia will interfere again, and other officials."}
{"original": "I wonder, as you see the president, as you see the attorney general, as you see, for instance, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee in the Senate, Ron Johnson, talking about all these possible conspiracies in 2016, who's minding the store now for 2020?"}
{"original": "Who should Americans at home feel confident in to protect the next election from Russian or interference by other countries?"}
{"original": "CLAPPER: Well, I think despite Senator Johnson's statements, the very same institutions that were attempting to protect the country in 2016, and that's the intelligence community, the CIA, NSA, et cetera, as well as the FBI. And those great, you know, men and women of those organizations continue to be vigilant and continue to try to keep the nation safe and secure, particularly as we approach the 2020 election. And I anticipate not only the Russians will be trying to interfere, meddle and influence, but other countries as well who went to school on what the Russians did and the success they enjoyed in 2016."}
{"original": "SCIUTTO: And, of course, we're in a remarkable situation now where the president seems to be inviting countries to do the same."}
{"original": "HARLOW: That's saying a lot that others have learned from Russia and he expects that others will do the same."}
{"original": "HARLOW: OK. We have a lot ahead. Coming up, we'll speak with Congressman Jamie Raskin. He, of course, sits on both the Intelligence and Oversight Committees. Will one or both of the whistleblowers testify? What are they expecting? We'll ask him next. Plus, more on the Trump administration's stunning move overnight, withdrawing troops from northern Syria. What does this mean for the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in the region?"}
{"original": "SCIUTTO: Well, they're abandoned again. And talks between United Autoworkers Union and General Motors have taken a turn for the worse, according to a chief negotiator. Is there any end in sight? Enormous political, economic consequences from this. We're going to be live in Detroit."}
{"original": "HARLOW: Well this morning, we are seeing a new strategy by some Republican lawmakers when asked whether they think President Trump asking China last week to investigate his political rival is out of bounds. A number of them are saying the president is just, you know, joking. Listen."}
{"original": "SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): I don't think it's a real request -- I think he kind of -- I think he did it to gig you guys."}
{"original": "SEN. ROY BLUNT (R-MO): I doubt if the China comment was serious, to tell you the truth."}
{"original": "REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): You really think he was serious about thinking that China is going to investigate the Biden family?"}
{"original": "HARLOW: With me now, Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland, he of course, sits on the House Oversight and Judiciary Committee. He's very busy these days, congressman, thank you for being there. Let me just begin with that? What is your response to your Republican colleagues who say the president is just joking?"}
{"original": "REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): Well, do they think he was joking when he withheld $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine, and then sent people over there including Rudy Giuliani, to shake them down to extract from them a commitment to investigate Joe Biden to unleash prosecutors and investigators on Joe Biden? Was that a joke too?"}
{"original": "Look, I think anybody looking at this, any reasonable observer would understand that's a completely absurd defense of the president who now has involved not just Ukraine, but Russia and invited China."}
{"original": "Look, I think we should step back and ask the question, why is it a big deal to get them involved? Because, you know, I disagree with Jim Jordan about almost everything, but I would defend with my life his right to participate in our politics. But that's not true of Vladimir Putin or Ukrainian prosecutors, Russian spies or Chinese operatives."}
{"original": "RASKIN: They should not be involved in American --"}
{"original": "HARLOW: So to that -- to your exact point, Congressman Raskin, listen to this, Mike Pompeo who by the way we now know was on that July 25th call between the president of Ukraine and President Trump, here's how he defended it, speaking in Greece over the weekend."}
{"original": "MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE, UNITED STATES: Look, nations do this. Nations work together and they say boy, goodness gracious, if you can help me with X, I'll help you achieve Y. This is what partnerships do. It's win-win. It's better for each of us. I don't -- I'm not offended when your Prime Minister asks me, can you help us with X, right? It doesn't bother me a lick."}
{"original": "HARLOW: It's win-win, it's best for all of us. Do you agree?"}
{"original": "RASKIN: Well, they're confusing international cooperation on economic and military and security objectives with the president converting the office of the presidency into an instrument of re-election, and an instrument of private self-enrichment. That's what this president has done."}
{"original": "He's treating the government of the United States as though it's part of his political campaign, and he's putting our national security at risk by trying to use other governments against American citizens. We've never seen anything like this, it's completely unprecedented in the history of our country."}
{"original": "HARLOW: Here is what Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said over the weekend about the whistleblower who he believes not only needs to testify before Congress, but needs to do so in public. Listen to this."}
{"original": "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): If the whistleblower's allegations are turned into an impeachment article, it's imperative that the whistleblower be interviewed in public under oath and cross-examined. Nobody in America goes to jail or has anything done to them without confronting their accuser. This is Kavanaugh all over again."}
{"original": "HARLOW: He even said, congressman, quote, if that doesn't happen in the house, I will make sure it happens in the Senate. This is those 90 former national security officials just wrote a letter, saying, we must protect the whistleblower. What is your reaction to Senator Graham saying they have --their identity has to be made public?"}
{"original": "RASKIN: Well, the desperation of some of the Republicans is quite extraordinary at this point. It used to be a bipartisan commitment that we protect whistleblowers because we want them to come forward with the truth of the conduct of our elected officials. But we don't have to depend on just this one whistleblower, not only is there another whistleblower who is about to come forward, but everything that the whistleblower said has been corroborated by independent objective evidence including the contemporaneous transcript of -- or memorandum about the phone call that took place on July 25th between President Trump and President Zelensky."}
{"original": "We also have objective, verifiable evidence that the president's withholding of the military assistance at the same time in order to create coercive leverage over this vulnerable ally resisting Russian aggression. So, everything the whistleblower has said has been objectively borne out by the testimony of other witnesses and more are coming forward every day."}
{"original": "And you can see already the contradiction in what they're saying. On the one hand, they're saying there's absolutely nothing wrong with what they did, as President Trump puts it, it was a perfect call, it was a perfect strategy. On the other hand, you can't believe the people who establish the reality and the facts of that call and this strategy that unfolded in order to put pressure on Ukraine."}
{"original": "HARLOW: Congressman, on the impeachment question, obviously you're leading on this front, and you've said that you think articles of impeachment are inevitable at this point, you said that to our Manu Raju. But Elizabeth Warren; Democratic senator running for president in 2020 said over the weekend when she was asked by a reporter, quote, you've seen enough evidence to convict yourself, meaning to convict in the Senate, and she said yes."}
{"original": "I wonder if you think that it would be more prudent for members of the Senate to wait until they see evidence before saying they are ready to convict. What do you make of her answer?"}
{"original": "RASKIN: Well, but I didn't see the interview and I assume what --"}
{"original": "HARLOW: I can -- let me play it. I have it --"}
{"original": "HARLOW: I believe, I think we can play it, just to give -- do we -- if they can get it back in there, we will play it for you just so you can --"}
{"original": "HARLOW: See the totality of what she said. Here it is."}
{"original": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You've seen enough evidence to convict yourself?"}
{"original": "SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes."}
{"original": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, you would vote right now to (INAUDIBLE) --"}
{"original": "WARREN: Look, I think the evidence is clear. When Donald Trump released the transcript and which he solicited a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 elections, he broke the law."}
{"original": "RASKIN: Well, what I take Senator Warren to be saying is that the evidence at this point is overwhelming of the president's culpability for perpetrating this plot which was a complete sellout of our constitution. Now, I'm certain -- I don't speak for Senator Warren, but I'm certain her position would be if there's evidence that contradicts it, then obviously, she would change her mind. But at this point, there's no evidence coming forward."}
{"original": "All we're getting really is the irrelevant distraction of the president calling people traitors and spies and them complaining about how unfair the process is, and all of these extraneous immaterial arguments. They really don't have any answer to the fact that what the president did is to unleash his operatives to go and to shake down the Ukrainian government in order to get political dirt on American citizens who are, you know, his political rivals and then cover the entire thing up."}
{"original": "And nobody has been able to negate a single element of that story and the evidence piles up every single day as more people come to testify. They're better off doing what they're basically doing now --"}
{"original": "RASKIN: Which is admitting it and saying, well, he wasn't really serious, he wasn't kidding, everybody does it. But all of that, again, is a distraction from a very serious offense against the constitution of the United States."}
{"original": "HARLOW: I would note the president of Ukraine said at the U.N., I didn't feel any pressure. We have to leave the conversation here, we'll be back to it very soon. Congressman Raskin, always appreciate your time, thank you."}
{"original": "RASKIN: Thank you for having me."}
{"original": "SCIUTTO: This is breaking news just in to CNN and it's significant as regards to the president. A federal court judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought by Trump in an effort to block a subpoena issued by the Manhattan District Attorney's office for eight years of the president's tax returns."}

{"original": "GINGRAS: And let's go back a little bit just to give some context here. Let's remember now what happened is, this is a back and forth between the Manhattan DA's office and the Trump org and the president himself for quite a while now. And essentially, what they are wanting was eight years of tax returns because they believe there was some business practices that were not legal during those hush money payments prior to the campaign --"}
{"original": "GINGRAS: Right? So, we've been going back and forth with these two sides for a long time."}
{"original": "SCIUTTO: But specific to the Stormy Daniels payments --"}
{"original": "GINGRAS: And essentially what happened here is the president argued while he was -- they were trying to get those tax returns, which many people have been wanting to see, that he can't be subjected to any criminality, he can't be under investigation while he is a sitting president."}
{"original": "And as you just read, federal judge says, well, that's not really the case, and he was very strong in his language. It was a very long actual comments as to why they believe that. But let me read it again, he basically said, categorical limitless assertion of presidential immunity that would constitute an overreach of executive power."}
{"original": "Essentially saying your argument isn't strong enough, and essentially they can go forward --"}
{"original": "GINGRAS: With this lawsuit that the Manhattan DA's office filed."}
{"original": "SCIUTTO: OK, so they going forward, the president's team has already filed --"}
{"original": "SCIUTTO: An emergency appeal. I suppose we see where that goes. Are they likely to be granted an appeal here?"}
{"original": "GINGRAS: It's not really clear at this moment, but let's also remember that this went so far as to the president's own Department of Justice got involved --"}
{"original": "GINGRAS: Saying that they wanted to have some sort of skin in this game and have an opinion about what was going on --"}
{"original": "GINGRAS: Between these two sides. So, it's almost like what's going to happen next because things are happening that we haven't seen before."}

{"original": "Those of you who are aged 50 or older have probably been working for a few decades, and you may be thinking about what comes next. Most of us dream of eventually leaving the workforce for good -- but what if you haven't even started saving for retirement yet?"}
{"original": "First off, know you're not alone. In fact, a recent GOBankingrates.com survey found that 28% of people over age 55 have no retirement savings at all, while 26% report that they have under $50,000 saved for retirement."}
{"original": "But with retirement fast approaching, there are still some moves you can make to get closer to achieving financial independence. Here are a few ideas to get you started."}
{"original": "If you're in your 50s and still haven't put anything away for your golden years, you should consider working until at least your Social Security full retirement age -- the age at which you can receive the full Social Security benefit you're entitled to based on your work history. The later you retire, the longer you can live on earned income and build up your savings, rather than drawing those savings down in order to get by."}
{"original": "Over the next 10 to 15 years, you'll need to turbocharge your savings. Generally, a savings rate of 15% of gross annual salary is recommended for people who have decades to prepare for retirement. But if you're in your 50s and haven't really been saving, then you need to dig as deep as possible. Ideally, you'll save 30% or more of your salary in order to get your savings on track to meet your needs in retirement."}
{"original": "If you're unable to save that much, then try to start at 15% and look for ways to make small increases over time. For example, every time you get a raise, put it directly toward your savings contributions."}
{"original": "Now that you know how much you should be saving, let's address where you should be saving. Tax-sheltered retirement accounts can offer you current and future tax benefits. If you have an employer-sponsored 401(k) or 403(b), you can contribute up to $18,000 this year, plus a $6,000 catch-up contribution if you're aged 50 or older, for a total of $24,000. If you can max out your retirement account and possibly earn an employer match, then you'll make up for some lost time."}
{"original": "If you don't have a workplace retirement plan, then you can save up to $5,500 per year, plus an additional $1,000 if you're aged 50 or over, in an IRA. If you're in a position to do so, make sure you reach to get these catch-up contributions in order to bridge the gap between what you have and what you need in savings. In fact, saving the full $6,500 for the next 15 years in an account earning 5% would yield a nest egg of about $150,000."}
{"original": "Look to sources of guaranteed income"}
{"original": "Social Security was never intended to be your only source of retirement income -- or even the primary source. But if you haven't amassed sufficient personal savings, then you will need to run the numbers to determine how you can maximize your Social Security benefit in order to help you make ends meet in retirement."}
{"original": "Go to the Social Security Administration's website, set up an account, and take a look at your expected Social Security benefit. Consider how much your check will continue to increase each year you delay filing for benefits. For each year you delay filing, your Social Security check will increase by about 8% until age 70, when your benefits will max out."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, if you reach retirement with a smaller nest egg, you might consider annuitizing a portion of your savings to provide a guaranteed stream of income. To learn more about how you can achieve this, see this article."}

The stock — which trades under the ticker symbol WOOF, naturally — surged more than 60% in its latest Wall Street debut, giving the company a valuation of $6.45 billion."}
{"original": "Petco has undergone a makeover since it went private in early 2016 through a leveraged buyout, my CNN Business colleague Matt Egan reports. The company, now known as Petco Health and Wellness, invested heavily in e-commerce and building veterinary and other on-site services aimed at making it a one-stop shop for pet owners."}
{"original": "We are the only retailer that offers all the pet parents' needs in one place, Petco CEO Ron Coughlin told CNN Business."}
{"original": "But Petco faces heavy competition from the likes of online retailer Chewy, which has emerged as one of the biggest winners of the pandemic. Chewy's shares skyrocketed 210% last year and have kicked off 2021 with another 28% rally. It now has a value of $47.3 billion."}
{"original": "Both companies are benefiting from an increase in pet adoption during the pandemic. But Chewy's sales are growing much faster — posing a challenge to Petco as it tries to solidify its place in the market."}

{"original": "Here we go again: Treasury yields are spiking, and unsettling the stock market, too."}
{"original": "Concerns about higher inflation caused an investor exodus from government bonds on Tuesday. Heavy selling drove the 10-year Treasury yield to 3.093%, the highest since July 2011."}
{"original": "The 10-year yield helps determine how much it costs to borrow money, including mortgages, car loans and credit card rates."}
{"original": "The bond market sell-off began after the government said retail sales grew at a healthy pace in April, signaling the economy started the second quarter on a positive note. Relatively weak retail sales in February and March were revised higher, another sign of firmer inflation."}
{"original": "Higher bond rates are acting as a brake on the rising stock market. The Dow dropped 193 points, or 0.8%, after having rallied eight straight days to the highest level in nearly two months."}
{"original": "Stocks that are sensitive to interest rates took a hit on Tuesday as investors braced for higher borrowing costs. The real estate, telecom and utilities sectors all dropped about 1%."}
{"original": "This is absolutely a critical level to blow through. It makes sense that stocks are selling off, said Kristina Hooper, global market strategist at Invesco."}
{"original": "Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Capital, said that rates could go even higher, at least in the short run."}
{"original": "We've got thin air up to about 3.2%, LeBas said."}
{"original": "Although rates remain relatively low, the speed of the move spooked some investors. The 10-year Treasury started the day at just 2.99%. And as recently as September, it was just above 2%."}
{"original": "Related: Oil prices: How high before Wall Street freaks out?"}
{"original": "Treasuries have come under selling pressure this year because of concerns that faster inflation will force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. A rapid rise of Treasury rates in late January and February caught investors off guard, causing stocks to tank."}
{"original": "Years of low yields on ultra-safe government bonds sent cash pouring into risky stocks, inflating their value. The reverse trend has slowed stocks down this year."}
{"original": "Inflation, which has been mysteriously low for years, has accelerated in recent months. Businesses are complaining about higher costs on everything from raw materials to trucking. Historically low unemployment suggests wages could finally pick up."}
{"original": "Households and businesses are also bracing for more expensive energy costs because of higher oil and gasoline prices."}
{"original": "At a minimum, firmer inflation suggests the Fed will continue to hike rates and shrink its massive balance sheet. If inflation were to accelerate much beyond 2%, the Fed could have to raise rates more aggressively."}
{"original": "Bond jitters have also been driven by signs of faster economic growth and Washington's soaring borrowing needs. President Trump's tax cuts, along with bipartisan spending increases, are forcing the federal government to sell tons of Treasuries at a time when the Fed is unloading them, too."}

The Panama Papers are a massive leak of 11.5 million documents allegedly exposing the secret offshore dealings of aides to Russian president Vladimir Putin, world leaders and celebrities including Barcelona striker Lionel Messi. The vast stash of records was obtained from an anonymous source by German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung and shared with media worldwide by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). / AFP / CHRISTOF STACHE (Photo credit should read CHRISTOF STACHE/AFP/Getty Images)"}
{"original": "It was the biggest story of their careers, and investigative journalists Frederik Obermaier and Bastian Obermayer knew the forces they were up against."}
{"original": "The most important rule for everybody was to really be careful who you talk to, Bastian told CNN's Fred Pleitgen on Monday."}
{"original": "Last year, they had received a tip from an anonymous source – to this day, even they don't know his or her name – asking if they were interested in data."}
{"original": "What they would receive was the biggest leak of information in history – terabytes – orders of magnitude more than WikiLeaks, Snowden's leaks, or anything else."}
{"original": "It immediately became apparent that what would become the Panama Papers had the potential to embarrass – or worse, implicate – world leaders and internationally sanctioned individuals, by linking them to offshore bank accounts that allegedly shielded wealth from taxes or authorities investigating wrongdoing."}
{"original": "So that's where the nail polish came in."}
{"original": "That was the part where my girlfriend really laughed at me, when I bought that nail polish, Frederik said."}
{"original": "They had already set up a special room at the offices of their newspaper, the German daily Süddeutsche Zeitung. Only a few people had access, and the computers within it had never been connected to the internet."}
{"original": "They wanted to be absolutely sure that the data trove they sat on would be safe from prying eyes, or prying hands, wishing to make it all go away."}
{"original": "It was very important to keep it secret."}
{"original": "So they went one step further and used the glitter nail polish (color unknown) to paint over the screws of their computer cases – if anyone tampered with them, they hoped, the polish would be cracked and they would know something was up."}
{"original": "You know, in Germany, it's not that dangerous, said Bastian. But still, we had those thoughts once in a while, yes. Yes, we did."}
{"original": "We were more worried about the safety of our colleagues in Russia and in Africa and in the Middle East."}
{"original": "'Oh, he is the cousin of Bashar al-Assad'"}
{"original": "It is important to remember, said Frederik, that the documents are not only about tax avoidance and tax evasion."}
{"original": "For example, there's one case, when we see that they speak about the cousin of Bashar al-Assad, who was sanctioned in 2008 by the U.S. And they realized that he is using some of the companies they set up but they kept him for a customer."}
{"original": "That man is Rami Makhlouf, a powerful man in Syrian politics and business."}
{"original": "PHOTO: LOUAI BESHARA/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Rami Makhlouf, cousin of Syria's Bashar al-Assad."}
{"original": "In 2008, the U.S. Treasury Department put him under sanction, saying he has used intimidation and his close ties to the Asad [sic] regime to obtain improper business advantages at the expense of ordinary Syrians."}
{"original": "A full three years later, just weeks before the uprising and crackdown that would lead to the Syrian civil war, an email contained in the data, from an employee at Mossack Fonseca, made clear the law firm was happy to continue doing business with the man. (The term Panama Papers arose as a reference to the country where Mossack Fonseca is headquartered)."}
{"original": "'As far as I can see, there are allegations (rumors), but not any facts or pending investigations or indictments against these persons, the firm's employee wrote."}
{"original": "PHOTO: Courtesy Süddeutsche Zeitung An email from a Mossack Fonseca employee dated February 2011."}
{"original": "It would take until that fall, according to the Guardian, for the firm to break ties with Makhlouf."}
{"original": "We saw documents where they call him – 'Oh, he is the cousin of Bashar al-Assad,' said Frederick."}
{"original": "There are documents where they realize that has claimed or alleged to be one of the financiers of the Syrian regime. But it seems that they didn't really care at the beginning."}
{"original": "In a taped interview released just after the leak went public, the law firm's co-founder, Ramon Fonseca, said: We do not participate in the activities of the company, nor do we have any responsibility over what the company does."}
{"original": "Remember that due diligence – looking into whether any clients or business partners were questionable, like Rami Makhlouf – is something recent, Fonseca said in Spanish. Ten years ago, there was no due diligence. The term was not even known."}
{"original": "CNN reached out to Makhlouf through his company, Syriatel, but has yet to receive a response."}
{"original": "Fonseca told the Financial Times he does not expect the leak to lead to one single legal case, but Frederick said the firm's co-founder may not want to speak so definitively."}
{"original": "Being associated with an offshore account – as the journalists say the Panama Papers show Makhlouf was – is not in and of itself illegal. And the journalists do not speculate what the money in Makhlouf's accounts would have been used for."}
{"original": "But running afoul of American sanctions, or sanctions elsewhere, in dealing with a so-called designated person or entity could have serious implications."}
{"original": "Although the company is headquartered in Panama, they have offices in the U.S. So there would be a possibility for U.S. authorities to get after Mossack Fonseca."}
{"original": "The journalists realized from the start the leak was going to be a big story, but it was right before they were about to take the story public that they realized just how huge it would be."}
{"original": "It was at a time when we at Süddeutsche Zeitung internally tested our Web page, said Frederick."}
{"original": "Our technicians told us that they had to test it some minutes before the official publication date."}
{"original": "And then we then saw Edward Snowden tweeting about this publication – that was a surreal moment."}

{"original": "Seven senators filed an ethics complaint against Cruz and Hawley, calling their support for the wholesale overturning of election results improper conduct reflecting on the Senate that should result in an investigation and recommendations for strong disciplinary action, including up to expulsion or censure, if warranted by the facts uncovered."}
{"original": "That sentiment was echoed by members of the public, who made the phrase As a Texan trend on Twitter on the day the ethics complaint was filed, with one person tweeting, for example, As a Texan, as an American, I'm outraged in the treasonous actions from @SenTedCruz to incite an armed insurrection at the Capitol. @tedcruz resigning is an easy out, he must be expelled."}

{"original": "It's unlikely that the Senate will expel Cruz and Hawley from their ranks: Such strong measures haven't been taken since the 1860s , when a raft of traitorous lawmakers -- including two each from Texas and Missouri -- were kicked out for supporting the Confederacy against the United States."}

{"original": "(CNN) President Donald J. Trump is an immoral force in the most powerful office in the world, and he must be stopped. Since falsely equating peaceful protesters and White supremacists in the aftermath of Charlottesville in his first year in office, Trump has repeatedly demonstrated that he is incapable of making morally sound choices. Worse, he intentionally makes debased ones that harm people, governmental institutions and sacred traditions in order to enrich himself. Consequently, Congress, the criminal justice system and the general public must hold Trump accountable."}
{"original": "Trump should be impeached. Congress should invoke the 25th Amendment, which would have the Vice President assume the President's responsibilities. But more needs to happen. Criminal charges, when appropriate, must be brought. His social media accounts should be suspended. Mark Zuckerberg announced that Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts are suspended for at least the the next two weeks. Other providers should declare the same, and any future attempts to spread misinformation should ban Trump indefinitely. To do otherwise is to replicate the behaviors that fueled his rise in politics, catering to his debauched, selfish whims."}
{"original": "In an astoundingly brazen attack on democracy, Trump pressured Georgia state officials to overturn their presidential election results . We, the people, can't continue to enable Trump's deranged pursuit of authoritarian rule."}
{"original": "Unbelievably, there are people who argue that in order to maintain peace, we should simply sidestep Trump's corrupt behavior. In his new book, former FBI Director James Comey advised Joe Biden to  not pursue a criminal investigation of Donald Trump no matter how compelling the roadmap left  no matter how powerful the evidence strewn across his history of porn stars and financial fraud."}
{"original": "Although the book was written before Wednesday's events, Comey's attempt to take the high road with Trump, supposedly to rebuild trust between the public and the Justice Department, misses the mark on what actually brings civility: fairness, justice and accountability. In addition, Trump's influence on society isn't going to magically disappear like he, a self-proclaimed  very stable genius , said the coronavirus would"}
{"original": "The physical threats to members of Congress, other officials and the media aren't going to vanish either when Trump leaves office."}
{"original": "On the very day when Congress was supposed to confirm the presidential election result, Trump incited a riot . Across the country pro-Trump mobs targeted state capitols . It's beyond clear that Trump has shown an inability to stop his reckless behavior. Comey clearly needs to make some serious edits to the book."}
{"original": "The stage of the presidency has helped Trump radicalize thousands (of mostly White people) to do his evil bidding. Moreover, his environmental, immigration and tax policies will cause harm long after Trump leaves office. The regularity of his debauchery has lulled us into forgetting he retreated to his dark hole of selfishness in the fight against Covid-19. If all that doesn't inform you that we must take any opportunity to stop him, then you probably share the same moral compass as Trump."}
{"original": "Sadly, five people died in this iniquitous insurrection. If Trump's left unchecked, more people likely will."}
{"original": "Protesters who stormed the Capitol should be identified and arrested. The FBI announced that it is asking for help in identifying the rioters."}
{"original": "There's still more than a week left in his term, and he still has command of the military. Recognizing Trump's impetuous, vindictive nature and his deranged belief that he won the presidential election, the 10 living former defense secretaries cosigned an unprecedented op-ed in the Washington Post on Sunday , writing, Efforts to involve the US armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory. Trump is vastly unfit to serve in the role of President. The 25th Amendment is there for moments like these."}

{"original": "The night before the tragic day of the riot, we saw in the Georgia runoff Senate elections how we should settle differences in a democracy -- by voting.

{"original": "The Democratic leaders of California and New York City are taking steps to provide health care coverage to some undocumented residents."}
{"original": "On his first day in office, California Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed a budget on Monday that would make California the only state in the nation to provide coverage to undocumented young adults through its Medicaid program."}
{"original": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced an even more ambitious program on Tuesday called NYC Care that would provide coverage for all New Yorkers. There are roughly 600,000 residents without health insurance, half of them undocumented immigrants."}
{"original": "From this moment on in New York City, everyone is guaranteed the right to health care, said de Blasio, comparing it to the universal pre-K program his administration implemented several years ago."}
{"original": "NYC Care will start rolling out in coming months and will take more than two years to be fully implemented, de Blasio said. It will cost at least $100 million, but the mayor said that the city would save a lot because fewer people would go to the emergency room, which provides pricey and inefficient care."}
{"original": "De Blasio told MSNBC's Morning Joe that the city would not raise taxes but would instead fund the program through the city's public health care system, which is now in better financial shape after years of dire straits."}
{"original": "We're spending a lot of money right now and we're not spending it the way we want to because people go to the emergency room, de Blasio said at a news conference. You have a lot of savings over time by not having people get health care the wrong way."}
{"original": "The mayor's two-pronged approach will harness the MetroPlus Health Plan, a subsidiary of the city's public hospital system that offers coverage to more than half-a-million New Yorkers via Medicaid, Medicare and Affordable Care Act policies. It will seek to boost enrollment among those who qualify, but are uninsured."}
{"original": "Also, the city will use NYC Care to connect New Yorkers who are not eligible for health insurance, especially the undocumented or those who can't afford coverage, to health care. They will be assigned a primary care doctor and have access to specialty care, prescription drugs, mental health services and hospitalization. Services will be priced on a sliding scale and will be free for the poor."}
{"original": "Wait times to see a primary care doctor would be in line with the one to two weeks it currently takes, officials said."}
{"original": "One question is whether undocumented immigrants will sign up at a time when the federal government has increased deportation efforts, said David Sandman, CEO of the New York State Health Foundation, a health care policy, research and grantmaking organization."}
{"original": "It's a very challenging time to roll out that welcome mat, Sandman said."}
{"original": "In California, Newsom would allow undocumented residents up to age 26 to enroll in Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program. The Golden State became the first to cover undocumented children up to age 19 in 2016."}
{"original": "Undocumented young adults should not have to worry about losing their health coverage when they turn 19, said Newsom, describing the effort as another major step toward universal coverage."}
{"original": "In a nod to creating a state-based single-payer system, the Democratic governor sent a letter to President Donald Trump and congressional leadership on Monday requesting that the federal government empower States like mine to design and implement truly transformative solutions for securing affordable health care for all."}
{"original": "Covering more undocumented Californians is part of a broader health care package Newsom unveiled Monday. The new governor also signed an executive order to create the largest single purchaser for prescription drugs and allow private employers to join the state in negotiating drug prices, according to a statement from the governor's office."}
{"original": "No state has more at stake on the issue of health care. California must lead, Newsom said in the statement. We will use our market power and our moral power to demand fairer prices for prescription drugs. And we will continue to move closer to ensuring health care for every Californian."}
{"original": "High drug prices have been in the national spotlight lately, with the Trump administration and Congress both promising to lower costs."}
{"original": "In addition, Newsom wants to expand the Affordable Care Act's financial assistance to middle-income Californians. More than 80% of Obamacare enrollees take advantage of federal premium subsidies, and one of the main criticisms of the law is that premiums are unaffordable for those who don't receive subsidies."}
{"original": "Newsom's plan is to expand access to financial assistance to individuals earning up to $72,840 and families of four earning up to $150,600. Currently, individuals making up to $48,000 per year and families of four earning up to $98,000 can receive federal subsidies under the Affordable Care Act."}
{"original": "Peter Lee, the executive director of Covered California, the state's Affordable Care Act exchange, praised Newsom's sweeping new proposals and actions."}
{"original": "We applaud Governor Newsom for building on the strong foundation of the Affordable Care Act in his first official action, Lee said in a statement. At a time of ongoing uncertainty from Washington, the governor is not only embracing policies that will lower the cost of coverage for millions in the individual market, he is also offering increased help to those who are struggling with rising costs."}
{"original": "Lee also noted that the governor's plan to restore an individual mandate penalty – which would be levied on those who don't have health insurance – would lower health care costs and increase enrollment. Congress essentially eliminated the federal individual mandate by reduce the penalty to $0 as part of the 2017 tax cut law."}
{"original": "Californians have through January 15 to sign up for Affordable Care Act coverage through Covered California."}
{"original": "Newsom also signed an executive order to establish a California surgeon general, according to the statement."}

{"original": "The methods behind an internet shutdown, particularly a complete one, are fairly simple. The government simply orders internet service providers (ISPs) to stop their connections – it's like turning off a home modem, but for the entire country."}
{"original": "Shutdowns can even happen accidentally, such as when one of the undersea fiber-optic cables which connect much of the world is damaged. This happened in 2008, cutting off a large swath of the Middle East from the global web."}

{"original": "After protests and riots broke out in the regional capital Urumqi in July 2009, internet access to all of Xinjiang – along with international phone and text messaging services – was cut off for almost a year."}
{"original": "This was justified on the grounds of security, with the military newspaper China National Defense Daily warning the riots once again demonstrates that it is becoming urgent to strengthen internet control. This is to avoid the internet becoming a new poisoned arrow for hostile forces."}
{"original": "Similar justifications have been made by other countries following China's lead. According to Access Now, the top three reasons given for internet shutdowns are public safety, stopping the spreading of illegal content and national security."}
{"original": "In Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni defended a 2016 shutdown as a security measure to avert lies … intended to incite violence and illegal declaration of election results."}
{"original": "Last year, Museveni's government passed a new tax on social media, under which users must pay 200 Ugandan shillings ($0.05) a day to use popular platforms like Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp. Ugandan officials previously traveled to Beijing to learn from Chinese censors how to control social media, with government minister Evelyn Anite saying the country was helpless in the face of criminals using the web to commit crimes with impunity."}
{"original": "China is heavily involved in Africa's internet, with state-backed firms like Huawei and ZTE building internet backbones and other infrastructure for countries across the continent. This assistance often goes hand-in-hand with filtering technologies and advice on how to control online dissent."}

{"original": "It pointed to trainings run by Beijing for foreign officials on internet policy and controls. While it is not always clear what transpires during such seminars, a training for Vietnamese officials in April 2017 was followed in 2018 by the introduction of a cybersecurity law that closely mimics China's own law, the report said."}
{"original": "Increased activity by Chinese companies and officials in Africa similarly preceded the passage of restrictive cybercrime and media laws in Uganda and Tanzania over the past year."}
{"original": "Patry, the Access Now expert, said that China has been pushing for a controlled internet in international debates. The most recent example of this was at the annual World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, southern China."}

{"original": "Democrats are making presidential tax returns a focal point in one of their first pieces of legislation, an effort to build the case to the American people that time is up on President Donald Trump keeping his own tax returns from the public, shutting what could be a window into his personal wealth."}
{"original": "According to two sources familiar with the discussions, Democrats will include a provision in their new bill that would require presidential nominees to disclose 10 years of tax returns shortly after they become the nominee. Vice presidents would also be required to disclose a decade of returns. The tax returns would then be posted on the Federal Election Commission's website for public viewing."}
{"original": "The 10-year requirement is new marker. At the end of last year, Democrats had disclosed H.R. 1 would require presidential candidates to release just three years of tax returns, but a source familiar with the process said that after reviewing precedent, the marker was moved to a decade of returns."}
{"original": "The provision would be included in H.R. 1, a far-reaching bill that makes sweeping ethics changes as well as lays out Democratic priorities on voting rights and health care. The legislation isn't expected to pass the Republican-controlled Senate or be signed by Trump, also a Republican. However, it will give committees an opportunity to set markers on Democratic priorities in the new Congress."}
{"original": "The House Ways and Means Committee had planned to hold a hearing on the tax provision in H.R. 1 at the end of January. However, it could slip into February depending on the outcome of a partial government shutdown that has consumed Washington and left House Democrats spending their early days in the majority negotiating to reopen the government."}
{"original": "While Democrats take a legislative approach, they are fully aware that it isn't likely to be signed into law. The House Ways and Means Committee is also pursuing another route to obtain Trump's tax returns. Democrats believe under an obscure IRS rule, the incoming chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, has the power to obtain the returns from the Treasury Department. Neal has said he plans to ask for them in the new Congress, but when exactly he'd make his move is still under discussion."}

{"original": "Chao's resignation isn't effective until Monday, but any effort to protect the country from these last days of Trump would probably have to go through the Congress via a lightning-quick impeachment process -- Trump's second -- as Pelosi suggested.

{"original": "Biden's stake. Does the next president want his first 100 days to be about Trump's last two weeks? He does not, reports CNN's Jeff Zeleny. Biden has a lot he wants to get done -- Covid, Obamacare, tax revisions."}

We're fortunate that pardons, general mayhem, and nuclear annihilation can't occur on weekends or holidays.)"}
{"original": "The reality, though, is that the constitutional mechanisms to remove him are cumbersome and give him the benefit of the doubt. In the 25th Amendment scenario, Bolton suggested you could end up with Trump and Pence dueling over who has power as president: Do you think Donald Trump will back down when he gets a letter from Mike Pence? Think again. So are we better off with two Presidents competing with each other in the last 13 days? I think you risk making the situation which is as bad as it is, far worse."}

And anyone not willing to forward that project with the fullness of their effort must be shamed and disgraced and removed from office. And that must start immediately with Donald Trump."}
{"original": "That's a remarkable thing to hear on network television, which is not known for its political statements. It was no less weird than another thing that happened Wednesday, which was that the National Association of Manufacturers -- a trade group not usually involved in radical politics -- called for Trump's removal."}

{"original": "The luxury retailer's sales and profits topped forecasts, and Tiffany also boosted its outlook. Shares rose a shiny 23% Wednesday."}
{"original": "Tiffany (TIF) did well in every market. Overall sales were up 15%, buoyed by strong spending in China and Japan. European sales rose sharply too."}
{"original": "Tiffany said US sales benefited from more tourists shopping in America. Jaded New Yorkers were buying more jade and other bling too. The company said locals also spent more in the quarter."}
{"original": "And profits got a big boost from US tax reform. Overall earnings surged 53% from last year. Tiffany said its effective tax rate was 25.3% in the quarter, down from 31.7% a year ago."}
{"original": "Tiffany has enjoyed a stellar run since Alessandro Bogliolo took over as CEO in October. Bogliolo succeeded Frederic Cumenal, who stepped down in early 2017 following a stretch of sluggish results. Tiffany's new CEO formerly ran Italian apparel company Diesel SpA, and he was also an executive at Sephora and Bulgari."}
{"original": "He said in the earnings release that Tiffany was particularly encouraged by the breadth of sales growth across most regions and all product categories."}
{"original": "Related: Why some retailers are winning big while others are losing"}

{"original": "Washington (CNN) President Joe Biden will name a powerhouse lawyer, Elizabeth Prelogar, to serve as acting solicitor general, in an acknowledgment that the office charged with representing the government before the Supreme Court will face an enormous workload both reversing Trump administration legal positions and developing a defense strategy as Biden's executive actions come under inevitable legal challenge."}
{"original": "Under normal circumstances, when an election produces an administration of a different political stripe, the solicitor general plays a key role managing a wave of potential reversals on certain issues. As Biden replaces Donald Trump, however, it could look more like a tsunami."}
{"original": "In the short term, for instance, the solicitor general's office is likely to notify the court of a new position in a blockbuster dispute concerning the future of the Affordable Care Act, defending the law rather than seeking to overturn it -- but also in other cases tied to controversial Trump policies, some of which the Biden administration may attempt to rescind before the Supreme Court can rule on them."}
{"original": "Under the Trump administration, the solicitor general's office was particularly aggressive defending a broad array of Trump's policies in hot button areas such as immigration, religion and abortion, often asking the justices to jump in before an issue had made its way through the lower courts."}
{"original": "Biden has yet to put forward his nominee for the permanent job. The solicitor general is the person who traditionally represents the US government in cases at the Supreme Court and regularly jousts with the justices in their majestic red velvet lined chamber -- or, as with current practice, over the telephone."}
{"original": "In the interim, Prelogar will be in the forefront. She is a veteran of the Office of Solicitor General having served as an assistant in the office and also worked recently as an adviser to former special counsel Robert Mueller during his investigation into Russian interference into the 2016 election."}
{"original": "Prelogar worked as a former clerk to Judge Merrick Garland, Biden's nominee for Attorney General, as well as the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Elena Kagan. Biden has yet to nominate a full-time solicitor general, and once that person is confirmed, she will be the principal deputy."}
{"original": "She's a spectacular lawyer with impeccable integrity and is ideal for this role in the Department, said Andrew Goldstein, a former top Mueller team prosecutor."}
{"original": "But while moving quickly, the Biden solicitor general's office also must be careful so as not to irritate justices who expect the government to be an honest broker acting in the long-term interests of the United States, not on the particular whim of one president or another. The court treats government lawyers with special solicitude, but in turn, the justices expect a level of consistency even when an election triggers a change of party in the executive branch."}
{"original": "The credibility of the office in great measure depends on the idea that judges actually believe that is what you are doing, Kagan, who served as President Barack Obama's solicitor general before her eventual elevation to the high court, said in 2018."}
{"original": "Kagan said the office made clear that its mission was supposed to serve the interest of the United States."}
{"original": "I think changing positions is a really big deal that people should hesitate a long time over, which is not to say it never happens, she allowed."}
{"original": "It's always a sensitive matter when the Solicitor General has to change positions, Elizabeth Wydra, president of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center said in an interview. But Biden's pick will have no choice but to do so in a number of high-profile cases."}
{"original": "In the case of the Affordable Care for instance, already there are blue and red states lined up on both sides of the issue. But the Trump administration argued that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and that the entire sprawling law should fall -- leaving the health care of millions in legal limbo."}
{"original": "It may only be a symbolic move that won't change the outcome of the case, but the new solicitor general will likely make clear to the court that the administration believes the signature legislative achievement of Obama's administration is on solid legal ground. The justices heard arguments on November 10."}
{"original": "Because the lawsuit was brought by Texas and other GOP-led states, rather than the Trump administration itself, the Biden Justice Department can change its stance but that wouldn't result in the case becoming moot."}
{"original": "Border wall, immigration and health care on the docket"}
{"original": "On February 22 the justices are scheduled to hear arguments concerning funding for Trump's border wall. And on March 1 they are scheduled to take on Trump's policy that mandates that non-Mexican asylum seekers stay in Mexico as they await hearings in the United States."}
{"original": "How the Biden administration and court will proceed is an open question. The President on Wednesday ended the national emergency that the Trump administration had used to divert money for the border wall. And it is suspending the program regarding asylum seekers."}
{"original": "The next day the court will consider a case concerning the Voting Rights Act."}
{"original": "Although not scheduled for oral arguments yet the court has also agreed to hear two cases concerning the Trump administration's effort to allow states to impose work requirements in their Medicaid programs."}
{"original": "Every cross-party transition raises these kinds of issues, but this one seems different in two respects, said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. First, the court has an unusually high number of cases challenging the old administration's policies on its docket this term, raising the specter that a number of those cases go away if and when the new administration rescinds them. Second, the Trump administration has been unusually aggressive in its litigation posture before the Justices -- whereas the Biden administration may be inclined to move slower on high-profile, hot-button cases."}
{"original": "Along with cases on the docket, the justices are also currently considering whether to take up additional cases linked to Trump -- some of which might become moot after he is no longer in office. Cases that are currently pending concern Trump's Twitter feed, two cases concerning whether he violated the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, others concerning restrictions that bar family planning clinics that receive federal funds from making referrals for abortion as well as petitions related to immigration."}
{"original": "And there is an emergency petition arising from Trump's personal lawyers who are asking the court to block the release of his tax returns to a NY prosecutor."}
{"original": "On his first day as president, Biden released several new executive actions and promised more to come. Critics are likely to race to court to try to stop them."}
{"original": "The Biden administration should take a both/and approach to executive action and legislative priorities, Wydra said. There is a lot of damage from the Trump administration that can and should be addressed immediately through executive action -- on police reform and immigration issues, for example -- while simultaneously pushing Congress for broader and more permanent legislation, she said."}
{"original": "Who's in play for the permanent job"}
{"original": "The solicitor general position needs Senate confirmation which often takes some time."}
{"original": "If Biden -- perhaps thinking that he might get a Supreme Court appointment in the near term, perhaps from a retirement of Justice Stephen Breyer — wants to take a page from the Obama/Kagan playbook he could name someone like California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger so as to prepare her for a potential seat on the high court. But Kruger may not want to leave a good job to face a bitter confirmation battle that might in short order lead to another battle for the high court."}
{"original": "No less than Chief Justice John Roberts once served as a deputy in the office. At his confirmation hearing in 2005 he spoke of the experience."}
{"original": "I always found it very moving to stand before the Justices and say, 'I speak for my country,' he said."}
{"original": "If you're a Millennial, you're in a great position to give yourself a fabulous retirement. You have plenty of time to save, which will means compound interest can be a powerful wealth-building tool for you."}
{"original": "And if you're like most members of your generation, you've already started putting money aside for retirement: The Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies reports that 72% of millennial workers have already begun saving, with a median starting age of 22."}
{"original": "However, knowing how to maximize your returns on said savings can make a huge difference in how far that money will go."}
{"original": "Here are five steps that could go a long way toward making Future You rich."}
{"original": "Most employers who offer a 401(k) plan will match at least some of your contributions. In other words, they'll contribute free money into your retirement account if you make contributions of your own. Different employers offer different levels of matching; check with your HR representative to find out what your own company offers."}
{"original": "Typically, employers will match your contributions up to a certain amount -- say, 5% of your salary. Once you find out how much your employer will match, make sure you're contributing at least that much each year. If you don't, you're throwing that free money away."}
{"original": "Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs allow you to contribute money tax-free. With a 401(k), the contributions come out of your paycheck before they're taxed, and with an IRA, you get to deduct your contributions, which means you don't have to pay taxes on that amount. However, you do have to pay taxes when you eventually withdraw the money to pay for expenses in retirement."}
{"original": "A Roth IRA works the other way around: The money you put into the account is taxed, but when you withdraw it, you don't have to pay taxes on it (assuming you meet all the qualifications). That makes a Roth account ideal for those who are just starting their career, because they're probably earning less now (and therefore paying a lower tax rate) then they will be when they withdraw the money. That means they could save a bundle in income taxes."}
{"original": "When it comes to investing, high risk and high returns usually go hand in hand. Riskier, more volatile investments -- those that tend to bounce up and down in value -- will generally earn greater profits over the long haul than investments that slowly but steadily gain in value."}
{"original": "If you've wisely begun investing well before you will need the money, you can take advantage of this rule by investing in more volatile assets (typically stocks) and getting a higher return on your money. You won't actually need the money for decades, so it won't matter if your portfolio tanks in value this year; it'll likely rebound in the next. That can lead to some pretty heart-palpitating moments as your investments see-saw up and down, but just grit your teeth and remind yourself that it doesn't matter how much those stocks are worth today; what matters is how much they'll be worth when you approach retirement."}
{"original": "When you're young, there's nothing wrong with living life spontaneously and occasionally flying by the seat of your pants. But maybe make an exception when it comes to saving money. You don't have to micromanage your investments -- just learn the basics of asset allocation and tweak your holdings about once a year so they don't get out of wack. If a mutual fund you own is going gangbusters, then it will take up a bigger and bigger percentage of your portfolio. If that mutual fund later tanks, you don't want it to drag your portfolio down with it, so do some occasional buying and selling to keep your investments in check."}
{"original": "You also need to figure out how much money you'll need to have saved by the time you retire. There are tons of retirement calculators that can help you determine this number; try using two or three different calculators to get a ballpark figure of how much you'll need, then adjust your savings to make sure you'll reach it."}
{"original": "And don't panic: That number may look huge now, but remember that compound interest will end up doing the heavy lifting. Here's a quick example to prove it. Say you invest $6,000 per year for 30 years and earn a respectable (but not exceptional) return of 6%. You'll end up with $503,000, even though you only invested a total of $180,000."}
{"original": "If you're earning a decent wage, saving as much as you can, and investing somewhat aggressively, then you'll be on track to save up hundreds of thousands (or even millions) throughout your career. Just contribute consistently to your retirement accounts and let the market take care of the rest."}

{"original": "President Donald Trump celebrated the new year with a 90+ minute Cabinet meeting on Wednesday – and cameras were rolling the entire time."}
{"original": "Like much of Trump's presidency, the event felt entirely free-form – as if Trump was making all of it up as he went. He seemed to support the Russian invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, proclaimed that he would have made a good military general and spouted falsehoods at an alarming rate – even for him."}
{"original": "I went through the transcript of the question-and-answer portion of Trump's Cabinet meeting and picked out the most, uh, noteworthy lines. They're below."}
{"original": "1. I've heard numbers as high as $275 billion, we lose on illegal immigration."}
{"original": "Eh, not really. Also, away we go!"}
{"original": "2. And you know, it's not all about the rich countries, because the rich countries really do take advantage of us, because they pay a very small percentage of their military, and they cheat on trade."}
{"original": "So much stream of consciousness, so little time."}
{"original": "3. There's some horrible things going on in the world, and we want to help those people."}
{"original": "Worth noting: Despite the CIA concluding that Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman was personally involved in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Trump has said no one can know the truth – and even if we did know the truth it wouldn't be worth risking our financial relationship with Saudi Arabia. So, there's that."}
{"original": "4. When they say I'm not popular in Europe, I shouldn't be popular in Europe."}
{"original": "One of the least covered but most important aspects of the Trump presidency is how he, unlike every president that has come before him, simply does not believe in the coalition built in the aftermath of Word War II."}
{"original": "5. I don't care about Europe."}
{"original": "7. I could be the most popular person in Europe. I could be – I could run for any office if I wanted to, but I don't want to."}
{"original": "So. Wait. Trump is saying he could run for any office in Europe? I am pretty sure that's not true…."}

{"original": "9. We're supposed to say 'Oh, thank you for the library.' I don't know who's using it in Afghanistan, but one of those things."}

Back in 2016, Trump aide Dan Scavino tweeted that the Pope was a hypocrite on immigration because Vatican City was surrounded by massive walls. As CNN's Daniel Burke wrote at the time: Yes, the Vatican does have walls, and some are quite large. But anyone can stroll through the Pope's front yard – St. Peter's Square – at nearly any time."}

{"original": "35. So Jeff Flake is now selling real estate, or whatever he's doing."}
{"original": "I am not sure where Trump got the idea Flake is going to be selling real estate as his post-Senate career. To the best of my searching, Flake hasn't announced what he's going to do after leaving the Senate. Also, isn't sell real estate what Trump did his whole professional life prior to 2016?"}

{"original": "After such a volatile 2018, predicting what the US stock market will do in 2019 is like guessing where a single piece of paper will land in a windstorm."}
{"original": "Few saw last year's market mayhem coming after an unusually sanguine and calm 2017."}
{"original": "Investors have some reasons for optimism in 2019: The economy remains relatively strong. Companies' fundamentals appear robust too, and stocks are undervalued compared to their expected earnings."}
{"original": "Yet political turmoil, rising protectionism, a hawkish Fed and slowing earnings and economic growth have sent shivers down investors' spines lately."}
{"original": "Those fears caused markets to jolt up and (mostly) down in dramatic fashion in 2018. So what are the risks for investors in 2019?"}
{"original": "The stock market responds to many data points, but corporate earnings are the most important of them all. If companies grow, their stocks typically rise."}
{"original": "Wall Street analysts expect earnings in 2019 will grow far less than than they did in 2018."}
{"original": "Corporate profits rose 23% in 2018 because companies were shot with a caffeine injection from the tax cuts at the beginning of the year. That buzz has already started to wear off, and 2019's growth won't look nearly as hot by comparison."}
{"original": "The dollar has also been rising throughout 2018. The US Dollar Index added about 5%, pinching corporate profits for America's multinational companies. A strong dollar makes US products more expensive abroad and can dampen international sales."}
{"original": "Lindsey Bell, CFRA Research Investment Strategist, told CNN Business she expects earnings to grow 7% in 2019. That's about on par with Wall Street's profit growth forecast of less than 10%."}
{"original": "That's strong, but not exactly something investors are thrilled about."}
{"original": "Still, the S&P 500 is trading at just 14.5 times 2019's expected earnings, well below its historical average of 16 times earnings. That's one reason why stock analysts believe markets are due for a comeback. Also, stocks were so universally battered that 2018's best sector (health care) rose just 5%, while the worst sector (energy) fell 18.5%. That tight range between the best and worst sectors is well below average — typically a positive omen for stocks the following year."}
{"original": "Should history repeat, and there's no guarantee it will, this year's lump of coal could metamorphize into an unanticipated gem, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research."}
{"original": "But even if they do bounce back, can stocks sustain a rally?"}
{"original": "Sure, says Tony Dwyer, analyst at Canaccord Genuity. Perhaps for a time. But even if stocks bounce back, he doubts the enthusiasm will last."}
{"original": "Most economists aren't predicting a recession around the corner."}
{"original": "That alone has some market analysts questioning why stocks have fallen so dramatically in recent months."}
{"original": "Once the market realizes a recession isn't imminent, it will find a bottom and slowly climb back to all-time highs again, said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance."}
{"original": "But America's economic expansion, the second-longest in history, is under threat."}
{"original": "Boosted by the tax cuts and the lowest unemployment rate in a generation, the US economy boomed in the middle of 2018, growing at an annual rate of 4.2% in the second quarter and 3.4% in the third quarter. But the Federal Reserve believes the pace of economic expansion will slow in 2019 to 2.3%."}
{"original": "After decades of sharp expansion, the Chinese economy is slowing down, too. Growth in 2018 is set to be the weakest since 1990. And 2019 looks even worse. Brexit could knock the United Kingdom off its feet in 2019."}
{"original": "Fear of a global economic slowdown has dragged stocks from their all-time highs set in late September. Investors worry about the Federal Reserve's plans for 2019. If it raises rates too quickly, the Fed could artificially slow the economy or even bring about a recession. Inflation is not currently a problem, so the central bank has the ability to slow its rate-raising pace if it wants."}
{"original": "If the Fed continues to ignore the weakening inflation data and maintains their current projected path, it could cause an even bigger disaster, said Dwyer."}
{"original": "By contrast, if the Fed signals it will stop hiking rates, Dwyer believes stocks could reach new highs in 2019."}
{"original": "Dysfunction in Washington and the United Kingdom have thrown investors for a loop."}
{"original": "No one knows what to make of Brexit, other than it's bad no matter what form it takes — and potentially disastrous if March 29 rolls around without a deal."}
{"original": "The US government shutdown probably won't mean much for the economy in the near term, but it has concerned investors that the impasse may portend bad news for a looming debt ceiling showdown."}
{"original": "American lawmakers must pass a law this year so the Treasury Department can continue to borrow without any restrictions. If they fail, the government could default on its debt. When that nearly happened in 2011, credit-rating agency Standard and Poor's downgraded America one notch below a perfect AAA. Another downgrade could make the United States' already massive debt load much costlier to pay back."}
{"original": "Trade tensions still loom over the economy and markets, too. The Trump administration is threatening to raise tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods if China fails to meet US demands on a variety of economic and political issues. American companies pay those tariffs, and they pass costs onto consumers, who account for two-thirds of America's GDP."}
{"original": "And Trump's continued threats to undermine the Fed chair that he appointed show no signs of abating. Investors may not love Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's hawkish policy, but they crave consistency, and threatening to unseat a Fed chair in the middle of his term could throw the markets into chaos."}
{"original": "As the market continues to worry about a recession, the implications of a trade war with China and unpredictable and adverse political decision-making from the White House, we are going to continue to see volatility, said Zaccarelli."}
{"original": "(CNN) -- Monday's 2009 Major League Baseball home opener for the New York Mets at their new ballpark promises to reignite controversy -- and not just over the team's suspect pitching."}
{"original": "Some Mets fans feel the $400 million stadium-name deal is a bad one for all parties in these economic times."}
{"original": "Though the Mets played exhibition games there earlier this month, they will officially debut their new home, Citi Field, against the visiting San Diego Padres."}
{"original": "The $800 million-plus Queens facility is undoubtedly a state-of-the-art baseball complex with many modern upgrades from the Mets' home for the past 44 years, Shea Stadium, which is still in the process of being demolished a few hundreds yards away."}
{"original": "One lifelong Mets fan summed up his emotions about saying goodbye to Shea and hello to Citi by saying: It was time for a new stadium, but I'm going to miss Shea very much."}
{"original": "The controversy arises not from the disappearance of the venerated old stadium but from the fact that rather than attach the iconic Shea name to the new ballpark, in November 2006 the Mets entered into an agreement with Citigroup for naming rights for the new stadium."}
{"original": "Reports have put the value of the deal at $400 million spread out in payments of $20 million per year over the course of the next 20 years. That would make it one of the most lucrative stadium naming arrangements in history. According to the Mets, besides the naming rights for Citi Field, The fully integrated partnership includes Citi brand and business unit presence throughout the new ballpark."}
{"original": "While other corporations have invested in similar deals in the past, the financial crisis has focused particular attention on Citigroup, the Mets, and the practice of paying vast sums of money for what is essentially a long-term advertisement."}
{"original": "Citigroup, which now does business as Citi, has been the recipient of billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded bailout money over the past year, causing many to question the prudence of $400 million going toward branding Citi Field, especially when Citigroup cut nearly 75,000 jobs in 2008, capped by 50,000 announced in November."}
{"original": "Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich, D-Ohio, has been an outspoken critic of the deal. He has called attention to the issue of corporate spending discretion, or lack thereof, particularly when jobs are at risk."}
{"original": "At the same time they're defending this $400 million stadium-naming deal, they lay off 50,000 people. Now, how many people could you employ for $400 million?"}
{"original": "The Mets claim that the construction of Citi Field created more than 6,000 temporary full-time equivalent jobs, with approximately 1,000 new positions resulting from ongoing operations at the ballpark."}
{"original": "One person whose job isn't at risk is Mets all-star third baseman David Wright. One of the franchise's most popular and marketable players, Wright is careful not to make any errors when confronted with the controversy surrounding his new Citi Field home."}
{"original": "I don't comment on things that I don't know about. I'm a baseball player, so I go out there and worry about my swing, he said. Watch fans give views on Citi Field name game »"}
{"original": "Kucinich conceded that paying to name a stadium is indeed great advertising except for one thing, the American taxpayers have invested heavily in these banks and the bailout fund should not be used for this purpose."}
{"original": "He advocates that the government, now a direct investor in Citigroup, has the obligation to monitor all aspects of how federal bailout funds are used, which in Kucinich's opinion includes any marketing or promotional endeavors."}
{"original": "Not all Mets fans agree. One ardent fan said he's happy his hard-earned tax dollars are going to help fund the Mets' new stadium. A lot of people pay for advertisements every day. We shouldn't be ashamed of it. Taxpayer money goes to waste on a lot of other things. Let's go Mets, I say!"}
{"original": "But another fan said, If it is indeed our tax money that is actually running the stadium, I wish that I wouldn't have to pay as much money to go see a game."}
{"original": "A group of fellow fans, many liking the sound of a Mets rebate in these troubling economic times, warmly greeted his idea before an exhibition game against Boston on April 3."}
{"original": "David Wright and the rest of the New York Mets, along with 42,000 boisterous fans, will formally open the new ballpark when the first regular-season game there begins at 7 p.m. Monday."}

{"original": "But that could be much higher if it could increase the proportion of women in work."}

{"original": "That's down from 37% in 2005, despite a strengthening economy and growing middle class."}
{"original": "That means India ranks 120 out of 131 countries, below far smaller economies such as Bangladesh, Vietnam and Indonesia and on par with Pakistan, Egypt and Yemen."}
{"original": "The World Bank estimates that increasing the rate of female workforce participation by as little as six percentage points could push growth up to 7.9%. If India closes just half the gap with Indonesia and Bangladesh, its economy could grow at 8.5% a year."}

{"original": "Donald Trump may not realize it totally yet, but yesterday was the last easy-ish day of his presidency."}
{"original": "By noon (or so) Thursday, Nancy Pelosi will become the new speaker of the House of Representatives – formalizing the Democratic majority her side won in last November's election. And that will change everything."}
{"original": "Trump has sought to look on the bright side of divided control of government to date – insisting that maybe he will be able to make deals with the new Democratic majority in the House. It really could be a beautiful bipartisan situation, he said at a press conference the day after the 2018 election."}
{"original": "But the early returns are not promising. The federal government has been shut down for the past 12 days – and there's little reason to believe that will change at any point soon. Trump has dug in on his demand for $5 billion to fund construction of his border wall. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, of New York, are equally dead-set on providing zero dollars for Trump's wall."}
{"original": "And this is only the beginning. Starting today, Democrats in the House will make Trump's life a living hell. Efforts are already underway to bring a number of his Cabinet officials before Congress, to extricate his tax returns from his grip and to more deeply probe his business dealings both before and during his presidency."}
{"original": "Trump, a political neophyte prior to the 2016 race, has never had to deal with this sort of opposition before. Sure, Democrats have never been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. But he never really needed Democrats to do much of anything, either. The Republican majorities in the House and Senate ensured Trump got his tax cuts and two Supreme Court picks. There was no real political penalty for his total unwillingness and inability to work with Democrats."}
{"original": "Those days are now over. Democrats can now do Trump real political damage using the official means of their House majority. While they may not be able to, say, force his tax returns into public view (the jury remains out on that), they can make sure the issue is front and center and create major distractions for a White House that has already shown it can distract itself very well, thank you very much."}
{"original": "Trump claims to understand this, likely with his self-professed titanic intellect. To me, that's like when people who are about to have a baby say they are totally ready for it. As evidence, they point to their nursery being all set up, the Diaper Genie being up and running, and so on and so forth. Then the baby comes – and they realize, like every parent that has gone before them, that no amount of planning or bracing could fully prepare them for their new reality."}

{"original": "Trump's dangerously pro-Putin flirtation with leaving NATO has met almost universal opposition in the Senate chamber. The biggest sign, however, is the Senate's softening support of Trump's monthlong government shutdown."}
{"original": "McConnell is a wily, unflappable, and determined Senate leader, and Democrats who underestimate him do so at their constant political peril, which is why the nervous muttering inside the Senate GOP about the economic damage this ongoing shutdown is causing the nation – to say nothing of the political cost it is causing the GOP – is so notable. For once, the complaints and concerns aren't from the Democrats whom McConnell spanks on a regular basis. The worry is coming from the Senate GOP, especially from some of the 22 Republican Senators up for reelection in 2020."}
{"original": "Unlike the class of senators who ran in 2018, when the GOP managed – quel miracle! – to gain seats in deep-red states like North Dakota, Missouri, and Indiana, the 2020 landscape for GOP incumbent senators includes many in battleground states – and in a presidential year."}
{"original": "Like all incumbents, the Republicans up for re-election in 2020 don't want to meet the same fate 40 of their colleagues in the House experienced last year. They'd like to go into a re-election year with a strong economy and the sense that Washington is at least vaguely trying to do something more productive than engaging in political arson. For now, however, McConnell seems to be following then-House Speaker Paul Ryan's strategy of 2018: Tie the GOP to the mast, and stick with Trump at all costs. His caucus is nervous, and rightly so."}
{"original": "Their pollsters are telling them how bad this looks. Their consultants are describing the ads their opponents will run against them in 2020. Their economic analysts are predicting grim results with each passing day. Even the White House is admitting the economy is suffering and the pain will get worse. Donald Trump's juvenile insistence that the taxpayers fund his ill-considered vanity wall on the US-Mexico border has left the government in shutdown and the GOP holding the bag."}
{"original": "Beyond the politics, many of the Republican members of the Senate seem to have a growing awareness of just how consequential and dangerous the shutdown has become for the American economy and the American people. Washington has spent the last two years with Stockholm syndrome Republicans either defending or explaining away Trump and Trumpism. Often, they found a pathway to shrug off his behavior and minimize the consequences of Trump's reckless and divisive leadership, but now the cracks are showing."}
{"original": "Donald Trump and Barack Obama both benefited from a decade of loose Federal Reserve monetary policy which unleashed a giant ocean of money flooding the capital markets in the wake of the 2008 economic crash. The Fed's slow wind-down of easy money was like the end of a raucous party, even with the sugar rush of the 2018 tax bill thrown in. The stimulative effect of the tax bill pumped up a few last months of market lift, but what may be a wildly overpriced stock market is testing the limits of optimism."}
{"original": "Trump's reality-TV trade war is costing American farmers and manufacturers billions. The trade war, combined with the shutdown's immediate and long-term costs, makes the Senate GOP increasingly complicit in engineering an economic downturn, just in time for the 2020 election season."}
{"original": "The rules of economic and political gravity are kicking in. Federal workers are going unpaid. The ripple effects in the economy just from those lost wages are going to hit the economic statistics and the markets hard – and soon. Government operations like the Coast Guard, air traffic control, and the Transportation Security Administration won't operate without pay forever. Even the President's beloved Border Patrol isn't being paid."}
{"original": "This President can't tweet his way out of an economic and governance disaster of his own making. No amount of this is fine coverage on his pet networks will refill the depleted bank accounts of 800,000 families."}
{"original": "As much as some Americans – particularly those in my party – would like to fantasize that government isn't an essential player in the economy, they're wrong. As an economic conservative, I wish it wasn't quite so central, but the truth is a stubborn thing."}
{"original": "Trump isn't merely holding some faceless bureaucrats hostage for his wall. This shutdown is part of a deliberate new politics of visible, performative cruelty, much like the Trump-Stephen Miller kids in cages show waged with immigrant children as the victims. The stories you're seeing on the news of government families working without pay and facing financial disaster are a feature, not a bug."}
{"original": "Trump views his presidency through a bizarre Manichaean lens; he must win the daily media coverage war. All else is secondary to him, but the issues are very real to the American people and the nation's economy."}
{"original": "We're locked now in a daily battle over a government that most people want reopened that is being held hostage for a wall that won't work and which a majority of Americans don't want. Someone is getting stuck with the bill for Trump's show, and that someone is going to be the Senate GOP unless it acts – and acts soon – to end the shutdown."}

{"original": "Republicans have become like compulsive gamblers, pulling the Trump lever over and over again at the worst political slot machine in history. The increasingly rare occasions they get an outcome they like – a judge here and a regulatory fix there – are offset by the unappealing combination of malice and ineptitude of a White House willing to burn the economy to the ground to satisfy this President's ego."}

{"original": "Among the chief advantages of trusts, they let you:"}
{"original": "Put conditions on how and when your assets are distributed after you die;"}
{"original": "Distribute assets to heirs efficiently without the cost, delay and publicity of probate court. Probate can cost between 5% to 7% of your estate;"}
{"original": "Better protect your assets from creditors and lawsuits;"}
{"original": "Name a successor trustee, who not only manages your trust after you die, but is empowered to manage the trust assets if you become unable to do so."}
{"original": "Trusts are flexible, varied and complex. Each type has advantages and disadvantages, which you should discuss thoroughly with your estate-planning attorney before setting one up."}
{"original": "When it comes to cost, a basic trust plan may run anywhere from $1,600 to $3,000, or possibly more depending on the complexity of the trust. Such a plan should include the trust setup, a will, a living will and a health-care proxy. You will also pay fees to amend the trust if it's revocable and to administer the trust after you die."}
{"original": "One caveat: Assets you want protected by the trust must be retitled in the name of the trust. Anything that is not so titled when you die will have to be probated and may not go to the heir you intended but to one the probate court chooses."}
{"original": "For a trust in which you want to put the majority of your assets -- known as a revocable living trust -- you also have to have a pour-over will to cover any of your holdings that might be outside of your trust if you die unexpectedly. A pour-over will essentially directs that any assets outside of the trust at the time of your death be put into it so they can go to the heirs you choose."}
{"original": "With a credit-shelter trust (also called a bypass or family trust), you write a will bequeathing an amount to the trust up to the estate-tax exemption. Then you pass the rest of your estate to your spouse tax-free. You also specify how you want the trust to be used -- for example, you may stipulate that income from the trust after you die goes to your spouse and that when he or she dies, the principal will be distributed tax-free among your children."}
{"original": "Since your spouse is also entitled to an estate-tax exemption, the two of you can effectively double (or more than double) that portion of your kids' inheritance that is shielded from estate taxes by using this strategy."}
{"original": "And there's an added bonus: Once money is placed in a bypass trust it is forever free of estate tax, even if it grows. So if your surviving spouse invests it wisely, he or she may add to your children's inheritance."}
{"original": "Of course, you can pass an amount equal to the estate-tax exemption directly to your kids when you die, but the reason for a bypass trust is to protect your spouse financially in the event he or she has need for income from the trust or in the event you think your children will squander their inheritance before the surviving parent dies."}
{"original": "A generation-skipping trust (also called a dynasty trust) allows you to transfer a substantial amount of money tax-free to beneficiaries who are at least two generations your junior -- typically your grandchildren."}
{"original": "You may specify that your children may receive income from the trust and even use its principal for almost anything that would benefit your grand kids, including health care, housing or tuition bills."}
{"original": "Beware, however. If you leave more than the exemption amount, the bequest will be subject to a generation-skipping transfer tax. This tax is separate from estate taxes, and is designed to stop wealthy seniors from funneling all their money to their grandchildren."}
{"original": "A qualified personal residence trust (QPRT) can remove the value of your home or vacation dwelling from your estate and is particularly useful if your home is likely to appreciate in value."}
{"original": "A QPRT lets you give your home as a gift -- most commonly to your children -- while you keep control of it for a period that you stipulate, say 10 years. You may continue to live in the home and maintain full control of it during that time."}
{"original": "In valuing the gift, the IRS assumes your home is worth less than its present-day value since your kids won't take possession of it for several years. (The longer the term of the trust, the less the value of the gift.)"}
{"original": "Here's the catch: If you don't outlive the trust, the full market value of your house at the time of your death will be counted in your estate. In order for the trust to be valid, you must outlive it, and then either move out of your home or pay your children fair market rent to continue living there, Janko says. While that may not seem ideal, the upside is that the rent you pay will reduce your estate further, Levine notes."}
{"original": "An irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT) can remove your life insurance from your taxable estate, help pay estate costs, and provide your heirs with cash for a variety of purposes. To remove the policy from your estate, you surrender ownership rights, which means you may no longer borrow against it or change beneficiaries. In return, the proceeds from the policy may be used to pay any estate costs after you die and provide your beneficiaries with tax-free income."}
{"original": "That can be useful in cases where you leave heirs an illiquid asset such as a business. The business might take a while to sell, and in the meantime your heirs will have to pay operating expenses. If they don't have cash on hand, they might have to have a fire sale just to meet the bills. But proceeds from an ILIT can help tide them over."}
{"original": "If you're part of a family where there have been divorces, remarriages and stepchildren, you may want to direct your assets to particular relatives through a qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) trust."}
{"original": "Your surviving spouse will receive income from the trust, and the beneficiaries you specify will get the principal or remainder after your spouse dies. People typically use QTIP trusts to ensure that a fair portion of their wealth ultimately passes to their own children and not someone else's."}
{"original": "Money in a QTIP trust, unlike that in a bypass trust, is treated as part of the surviving spouse's estate and may be subject to estate tax. That's why you should create a bypass trust first, which shelters assets up to the estate-tax exemption, and then if you have assets left over you can put it in a QTIP, Levine says."}

{"original": "Washington (CNN) The White House is proposing a new budget that would not eliminate the federal deficit in the next 10 years."}
{"original": "White House Office of Management and Budget acting director Russell Vought acknowledged that Congress has a history of ignoring the President's spending proposals."}
{"original": "They have certainly ignored this President's savings proposals for the first three years. That may very well continue this year. But it would be unfortunate, Vought told reporters at a briefing Monday afternoon."}
{"original": "Trump had campaigned in 2016 on pledging shrinking the federal deficit. And while the President's 2021 plan does not eliminate the deficit in 10 years, it does reduce it by slashing entitlements and other non-discretionary domestic spending."}
{"original": "The President's budget would slash funding for the Commerce Department by 37% for the upcoming fiscal year. Foreign aid overseen by the State Department would be cut by nearly 21%."}
{"original": "The administration is also looking to cut roughly 8% from each of the Departments of Agriculture, Energy and Education. Specifically, Trump's budget proposes consolidating some education programs into a block grant and, for the fourth year in a row, eliminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Congress has never adopted the student loan proposal."}
{"original": "The proposal also calls for a 15% cut from the Housing and Urban Development's budget, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would see its budget trimmed by 9%."}
{"original": "Trump said Monday that his administration's budget proposal would include $740 billion in military spending, would not touch Medicare or Social Security and would not decrease funding toward Medicaid."}
{"original": "We're doing a lot of things that are very good, including waste and fraud, Trump said."}
{"original": "But the new budget proposal calls for $844 billion in savings over 10 years from the President's health reform vision. It projects hundreds of billions of dollars in savings through changes to several federal safety net programs, including Medicaid, food stamps and federal disability programs."}
{"original": "There is nothing that touches Social Security or Medicare beneficiaries in these budgets. We have reforms as it pertains to the payment side, where you're buying and reimbursing for health care costs, Vought said."}
{"original": "Earlier in his presidency, Trump appeared to pay little attention to cutting the nation's deficit. Instead, the nation's deficit and debt has ballooned under his presidency with tax cuts and increased federal spending."}
{"original": "The deficit -- the gap between how much the government spends versus how much it takes in -- surpassed $1 trillion for the calendar year in 2019, marking the first time since 2012."}
{"original": "That number is only expected to widen even further over the coming decade, reaching a total of $1.7 trillion in 2030, according to the latest projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released in late January."}
{"original": "That's a sharp contrast to the White House's latest blueprint, which projects that the deficit will shrink to $261 billion by 2030. The President's budget assumes that the economy will grow at around 3% annually during that period of time helping to narrow the gap. Those estimates are significantly higher than what most economists anticipated along with the Federal Reserve."}
{"original": "The deficit growth predicted by the Congressional Budget Office is due in part to tax cuts and a two-year budget deal that has boosted federal spending under Trump. It's swelled to $984 billion at the end of the last fiscal year, up from $665 billion during his first year in office in 2017. Usually, big budget deficits widen during economic downturns -- but the US economy is expanding and unemployment is at a 50-year low."}
{"original": "The budget proposal requests $2 billion in homeland security funds for the US southern border wall -- billions less than Congress had previously agreed to. The proposal also includes $3.1 billion for 60,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention beds -- a jump from the 54,000 detention beds per day they've previously asked for and a move away from last year's funding deal that called for the daily population to drop to around 40,000 beds per day."}
{"original": "The plan also calls for at least $1.5 trillion in cuts to non-defense discretionary programs, which does not include Medicare or Social Security, according to CNN's review of the planned budget."}
{"original": "Former White House Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett said on Monday that the budget proposal relies on potentially unrealistic growth to make up for anticipated cuts to programs such as Medicaid and food stamps."}
{"original": "Asked by CNN's Poppy Harlow whether Medicaid cuts were coming, Hassett said: If you look at the stronger economy -- and there (are) some pretty strong growth assumptions in the budget, maybe higher than I would want to go now -- but with those strong growth assumptions, you get lots of people off of food stamps, people out of welfare."}
{"original": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reacted to the anticipated budget in a statement Sunday night, saying, The budget is a statement of values and once again the President is showing just how little he values the good health, financial security and well-being of hard-working American families."}
{"original": "The national debt has been rising at an accelerated rate in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when Congress and the Obama administration approved stimulus funding in order to keep the economy afloat."}
{"original": "The debt began to level off at the beginning of Trump's term, but bounced up again as the tax cuts passed at the end of 2017 took effect and the dramatically lower corporate tax rate lowered Treasury revenues."}
{"original": "On Monday, Hassett also appeared to concede that the corporate tax cuts added to the deficit more than they thought it would."}
{"original": "The tax cuts reduced revenue by more than we thought in the first year ... the corporate taxes are losing revenue with the rate, but gaining revenue with all the international tax rules and the stuff that can't pay for itself is like the joint tax cord, Hassett said."}
{"original": "As a candidate, Trump promised to get rid of the national debt, telling the Post in 2016 that he could make the US debt-free over a period of eight years."}

{"original": "As history is written, I can only hope that I will be judged for the 30 years of service that I've given to this country and the city of New York, he said."}
{"original": "In court papers, prosecutors said Kerik denied to a White House official that there was any possible concern about his relationships with contractors involved in renovating an apartment of his or that he had any financial dealings with prospective city contractors."}
{"original": "Kerik had been scheduled to go to trial on a variety of corruption charges, including allegations that he received and concealed benefits of about $255,000 in renovations to his Riverdale, New York, apartment from a company seeking to do business with the city of New York.

{"original": "Just when it seemed like the Chicago Cubs were going to enter spring training with a major hole on their roster, they've gone and filled it in the best way possible."}
{"original": "All it took was dropping $126 million on Yu Darvish."}
{"original": "Now, a couple asterisks are in order here. According to Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic, the six-year contract that Darvish reportedly agreed to on Saturday could end up being worth $150 million if he wins multiple Cy Young Awards. Or, the Cubs could ultimately pay him less than $126 million. Per Jeff Passan of Yahoo Sports, Darvish's deal has an opt-out after 2019."}
{"original": "Also, everyone is still waiting for the Cubs to confirm the signing."}
{"original": "Assuming all this is true, however, it can nonetheless be acknowledged that they've made out very well."}
{"original": "When the 2017-18 Major League Baseball offseason first began, projections for Darvish's contract—e.g. from Bleacher Report, MLB Trade Rumors and FanGraphs—fell in the range of six years and $26-28 million per year. The Cubs have followed the six-year blueprint, but at just $21 million per year."}

{"original": "Rank Team 2016/2017 SP WAR Difference 1 Mets -16.5 2 Cubs -15.0 3 Blue Jays -10.5 4 Giants -9.8 5 White Sox -9.6"}
{"original": "In posting an MLB-best 2.96 ERA over a National League-high 989 innings, Cubs starters more than did their part in helping the team win 103 games and a long-awaited World Series title in 2016."}
{"original": "They simply couldn't maintain that performance in 2017, however. They managed only 888.1 innings and a 4.05 ERA."}
{"original": "Neither Jon Lester nor Jake Arrieta nor John Lackey pitched like their usual selves. Kyle Hendricks did in the latter half of the year, but not before he struggled out of the gate and spent over a month on the disabled list. And up until Jose Quintana arrived via a blockbuster trade in July, the Cubs wasted too many starts on Brett Anderson, Eddie Butler and Mike Montgomery."}
{"original": "After the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Cubs in the 2017 National League Championship Series, it was clear that their starting rotation would be a major offseason project. At the very least, they would have two spots to upgrade once Arrieta and Lackey were let loose into free agency."}
{"original": "The signing of Tyler Chatwood to a three-year, $38 million contract took care of one spot."}
{"original": "Chatwood, 28, isn't much of a workhorse, as he's never pitched more than 158 innings in a season. But it does catch one's eye that he put up a 3.18 ERA away from Coors Field during his time with the Colorado Rockies. He also has a talent for inducing ground balls (54.7 GB%) that will play well with the Cubs' infield. Thus, he should do better than the 4.59 ERA that the Cubs got from Lackey in 2017."}
{"original": "And now the Cubs have Darvish, who ought to be better than Arrieta."}
{"original": "Whereas Arrieta's performance has been slipping since his epic Cy Young-winning 2015 season, Darvish is carrying on just fine. The 31-year-old put up a 3.86 ERA over 186.2 innings last season. The year before, he returned from a 2015 Tommy John operation to post a 3.41 ERA in 100.1 innings."}
{"original": "Granted, the fact that Darvish has already had a major elbow operation is a red flag. Another red flag is that he did his best work before the surgery, posting a 3.27 ERA across his first three major league seasons with the Texas Rangers."}
{"original": "It's a good sign, however, that neither age nor injury have robbed Darvish's arm of its liveliness."}
{"original": "He's enjoyed the best fastball velocity of his career over the last two seasons, peaking with an average of 94.2 mph in 2017. Between that and a deep arsenal of secondary pitches that's still led by his trusty slider, he has what he needs to carry on as one of baseball's best strikeout artists."}
{"original": "Darvish's career rate of 11.0 strikeouts per nine innings is the best in history among all starting pitchers who've made at least 100 starts. His 10.7 K/9 since 2016 only falls slightly short of that mark, yet still ranks ahead of Corey Kluber (10.6) and Clayton Kershaw (10.4)."}
{"original": "One nit worth picking is that Darvish does give up a lot of home runs. But his strikeout habit isn't the only thing he has to downplay that. He's also improving his control as time goes by. To wit, his walk rate has been below the league average in each of the last two seasons."}
{"original": "As for Darvish's postseason track record, it's a bad look that he has a 5.81 ERA in six career October starts. It's a worse look that he got absolutely shelled in the two starts he made for the Los Angeles Dodgers in last year's World Series."}
{"original": "But according to Tom Verducci of Sports Illustrated, that may have been because Darvish was tipping his pitches. Assuming he's learned his lesson, he's not necessarily doomed to additional October struggles."}
{"original": "Even before the Cubs signed Darvish, it was possible to have faith in Lester and Hendricks bouncing back and combining with Quintana and Chatwood to form one of MLB's best starting rotations in 2018. With Darvish now in the fold, the Cubs have a starting rotation that measures up against anyone's."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo still anchor a deep and multitalented lineup that's excelled on both offense and defense over the last two seasons. And while Wade Davis is notably missing from Chicago's bullpen, the additions of Brandon Morrow and Steve Cishek should make up for that."}
{"original": "At least on paper, the Cubs are now safely ahead of revamped versions of the Milwaukee Brewers and St. Louis Cardinals in the NL Central. Even better, they have everything they need to go toe-to-toe with the Dodgers and Washington Nationals for the National League pennant."}
{"original": "All in all, not a bad way to cap their offseason."}

{"original": "President Donald Trump was briefed on flight delays at major East Coast airports, his spokeswoman said on Friday, as officials inside the White House and on Capitol Hill ponder whether a widespread air travel debacle could break the weeks-long shutdown stalemate."}
{"original": "The President has been briefed and we are monitoring the ongoing delays at some airports, press secretary Sarah Sanders wrote in a statement. We are in regular contact with officials at the Department of Transportation and the FAA."}
{"original": "It's too early to say whether the flight delays at eastern airports will break the shutdown stalemate. But the prospect of a national air travel meltdown has long loomed in the minds of White House and congressional officials as the one thing that might bring an end to the stalemate."}
{"original": "And it comes as Trump is facing increasing pressure from Republicans to find an end to the shutdown, whose consequences have mounted as it stretches longer than a month. On Thursday, Republican lawmakers vented their frustration at Vice President Mike Pence during a tense lunch over a lack of a strategy out of the shutdown."}
{"original": "On Friday morning, air traffic was delayed at two New York-area airports – LaGuardia and Newark – in addition to Philadelphia International Airport due to staffing issues at a Federal Aviation Administration regional air traffic control center."}
{"original": "The delays came as the partial federal government shutdown entered its 35th day and as hundreds of thousands of federal workers missed another paycheck. Earlier in the week the president of a major air traffic controllers union warned that the ongoing shutdown poses a major safety risk."}
{"original": "Administration officials have said as recently as this week that if the shutdown began to devastate air travel, they feared Republicans would jump ship and get on board with a short term Democratic plan to reopen the government."}
{"original": "And it's not just inside the White House. Outside political advisers to the President and his allies on Capitol Hill have worried major flight issues would amplify the blame Trump is already facing for the shutdown. They, too, believe that major disruptions to air travel would ramp up pressure to reopen the government without wall funding."}
{"original": "Trump's main foil in the shutdown battle, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, sought to place blame for the delays on the President."}
{"original": "The #TrumpShutdown has already pushed hundreds of thousands of Americans to the breaking point. Now it's pushing our airspace to the breaking point too, she wrote on Twitter. @realDonaldTrump, stop endangering the safety, security and well-being of our nation. Re-open government now!"}
{"original": "One of his top allies, meanwhile, suggested the delays could shake loose a deal."}
{"original": "I think the problems at the airport are a sign of things to come and I've been ready for weeks now to reopen the government and give us a chance without a shutdown hanging over us to reach a compromise, Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters."}
{"original": "As the shutdown has worn on, Trump and top Cabinet officials have come under scrutiny for appearing to lack empathy for unpaid federal workers. Officials insist the President is concerned about their plight, even if in public he's made puzzling statements like one he delivered on Thursday suggesting grocery stores might allow regular shoppers to take food without paying."}
{"original": "In conversations with aides, Trump has been focused on two particular areas where Americans might be adversely affected: air travel (including security line waits and delays) and tax returns. He has asked aides whether TSA and FAA workers are breaking laws by calling out sick, likening it to the air traffic controllers strike during the Reagan administration. President Ronald Reagan fired thousands of air traffic controllers in 1981, alleging they broke a law that bans federal employees from going on strike."}
{"original": "When reports first began emerging in early January of higher-than-normal sickouts among TSA agents, the administration sought to downplay the matter, and Trump himself called the notion fake news on Twitter."}
{"original": "Yet the issue persisted, and on Friday the TSA said in a statement that call-out rates among officers were double the rate from a year ago."}

{"original": "Teachers protesting instead of teaching. Parents scrambling to arrange care for their kids. Lawmakers arguing over how to fix a mess quickly that's been decades in the making."}
{"original": "The mess in Detroit Public Schools has grabbed national headlines, even as most of the country is looking forward to summer vacation."}
{"original": "Here's a look at how we got here, and maybe where we're going:"}
{"original": "What's the deal with Detroit schools?"}
{"original": "What's not the deal might be a better question."}
{"original": "The district, which is under state control, is deeply in debt. It's about to run out of money to pay teachers, educators say many school buildings are a mess and student achievement is generally quite poor."}
{"original": "Detroit's problems are both legion and legendary, the stuff of books, academic treatises and detailed chart-heavy reports."}
{"original": "But this is it, in short: People left and took their money with them, and nobody's been able, or willing, to fix it since."}
{"original": "Since peaking at 1.8 million residents in the 1950s, Detroit's population has fallen to an estimated 680,000 as of 2014. The population losses began as the city's fabled auto industry started moving to the suburbs and tens of thousands of residents followed."}
{"original": "Enrollment in city schools has similarly fallen by 100,000 in the last decade alone, according to the state of Michigan."}
{"original": "Fewer students means less state funding, and that has contributed to a huge operating deficit, not to mention the district's enormous debt burden – $515 million, or nearly $11,000 for each of the district's 47,000 students."}
{"original": "How is the debt affecting education?"}
{"original": "A lot of the money the district does get from the state for education has instead been going to pay off those bills, according to state officials, contributing to academic deficits in many classrooms across the city."}
{"original": "And on top of that, the latest emergency manger appointed by the state to run the district – there have been four since 2009 – told lawmakers in March that it would run out of money to pay teachers this month if the state didn't send emergency funds to Detroit, and quickly."}
{"original": "And that's how we got to teachers calling in sick to protest the prospect of not getting paid after June 30."}
{"original": "However, teachers got a guarantee on Tuesday, May 3 that they would be paid for the full school year."}
{"original": "Why are teachers complaining they won't get paid in the summer?"}
{"original": "Well, teachers in Detroit can opt to spread their paychecks out over the entire calendar, instead of just receiving them during the academic year."}
{"original": "That means an estimated two-thirds of teachers would go without paychecks over the summer, the American Federation of Teachers figures."}
{"original": "School officials haven't corroborated those numbers."}
{"original": "What do Detroit teachers get paid anyway?"}
{"original": "On average, $63,716, according to the state."}
{"original": "How does that stack up with teachers elsewhere?"}
{"original": "Detroit comes in 101st among Michigan's 904 school districts, according to state data."}
{"original": "The highest-paid teachers in the state? Those in the DeTour Area Schools, where the average salary is $89,373, according to the state."}
{"original": "Nationally, the average salary for elementary, primary, secondary and special education teachers is $56,370, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics."}
{"original": "So what other complaints do teachers have?"}
{"original": "Overcrowded classrooms, crumbling and unsafe buildings, equipment shortages – you name it."}
{"original": "In some schools, teachers complain of classrooms with upward of 45 students, scurrying roaches and rodents, dripping leaks, mold damage and more."}
{"original": "In January, a lawsuit filed by teachers against the district alleged unrepaired bullet holes, exposed wiring and heating systems that leave some classrooms freezing and others sweltering."}
{"original": "The union even said a school dedicated to technology lacked Internet access."}
{"original": "Well, student achievement is in the toilet."}
{"original": "National surveys show Detroit's math and reading scores have fallen to the lowest ranking among the nation's largest cities."}
{"original": "Oh, and there's a bribery scandal."}
{"original": "In March, federal prosecutors charged 13 current or former Detroit school officials with bribery in an alleged kickback scheme. Authorities accused a vendor of paying off the school officials to allow their schools to be charged for supplies he never delivered."}
{"original": "Two officials were expected to appear in court Tuesday in the case."}
{"original": "OK, but can teachers really just walk out like this?"}
{"original": "Public employee strikes are illegal in Michigan, according to the state's Public Employment Relations Act. To the extent that a sickout is a strike – defined by state law as the concerted failure to show up for work for the purpose of inducing, influencing, or coercing a change in employment conditions, compensation, or the rights, privileges, or obligations of employment – it might not be legal either."}
{"original": "But figuring out whether it's a strike or a sudden epidemic of the achoos could be time-consuming and costly. Back in 2006, when Detroit teachers openly went on strike, the district didn't even file a complaint because of those issues, the Detroit Free Press reported."}
{"original": "Detroit schools did go to court in January, during the last wave of sickouts, to force teachers back into the classroom, but a judge dismissed union officials from the complaint."}
{"original": "So, is anybody doing anything about all these problems?"}
{"original": "Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder has proposed a $715 million plan to create an entirely new school district, give it state funding for student education and then use a portion of Detroit tax revenues to pay off the debt owed by the old district, which would no longer be in the education business."}
{"original": "It would take 15 to 20 years to get the debt paid off, according to Peter Wills, chief of staff for state Sen. Goeff Hansen, who introduced some of the legislation."}
{"original": "Lawmakers were working on some of those bills Tuesday, including a proposal to eliminate the prohibition on emergency lending to Detroit schools and authorize a $33 million emergency loan."}

{"original": "I'm 48 years old and would like to retire by the time I'm 55. What do I need to do make that happen? -- V.M."}
{"original": "Many people dream of making an early exit from the work-a-day routine. But making that dream a reality can be a challenge. The reason is simple. By retiring at 55 instead of, say, 65, you not only have 10 fewer years of saving and investing to build a nest egg, that nest egg also has to support you through an extra 10 years of retirement. That double-whammy of fewer working years to save and more retirement years to spend is what makes early retirement so tough to pull off."}
{"original": "But while calling it a career a good decade before you reach a more traditional retirement age may be daunting, it's not impossible. It will, however, take some serious, disciplined planning. Here are the four most important things you should do to improve your chances of success."}
{"original": "1. Ramp up your savings rate."}
{"original": "To maintain an acceptable lifestyle throughout a retirement that could last upwards of 40 years, you're going to need a sizable savings stash to support you. For example, let's say that in addition to the income you'll eventually receive from Social Security and any other sources, you'll need an inflation-adjusted $50,000 a year from savings in order to maintain your standard of living in retirement."}
{"original": "To have a reasonable shot at being able to pull that amount from savings year after year without too high a risk of running out of money too soon, you'll likely need a savings stash somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 to 35 times the annual income you wish to withdraw, or in this example a nest egg of roughly $1.5 million to $1.8 million."}
{"original": "You can get by with a much smaller nest egg, of course, if you'll be depending on it for significantly less income. But the point is that to accumulate enough savings during your working years to support yourself over an extra long retirement, you're going to have to do some heavy-duty saving."}
{"original": "Related: How much can I expect to earn on my retirement savings?"}
{"original": "The savings rate you should shoot for will depend on how much you've managed to tuck away already, how many years you have until you retire and how much income you'll need your nest egg to generate. But the standard recommendation of 15% or so a year isn't likely to do it. To have a realistic chance of throwing off the shackles of your 9-to-5 in your mid-50s, you may have to have to sock away upwards of 25% to 30% a year."}
{"original": "You can get a decent estimate of what sort of savings effort will be required by going to a good retirement income calculator and plugging in the age at which you hope to retire, the amount you already have saved and how income you think you'll need when you retire. By running several scenarios with different savings rates, you should be able to come away with a sense of how much you'll need to ratchet up your savings rate to have a reasonable shot at success."}
{"original": "2. Get a handle on your retirement expenses."}
{"original": "Many people assume their expenses will drop once they retire, but that's not necessarily true. Indeed, a 2015 study that examined changes in household spending in retirement found that nearly half of retirees actually spent more after leaving their jobs, at least in the initial years after retiring. So if want to accurately gauge whether you'll have enough income to cover your retirement living costs if you leave your job early, you need to have a realistic fix on what you're actually likely to spend."}
{"original": "Related: The best way to get guaranteed income in retirement"}
{"original": "The best way to do that is to create a detailed retirement budget. There are a number of free online interactive budgeting tools out there, but I like BlackRock's Retirement Expense Worksheet because it easily allows you to enter some 50 different expenses in eight broad categories. The worksheet also separates essential living expenses (housing, food, etc.) from discretionary ones (travel, entertainment, hobbies) so you can easily see how much room you'll have to cut expenses if necessary in the future without eliminating necessary expenditures."}
{"original": "Don't worry if you're not certain what your eventual retirement expenses will be. Do the best you can for now, and then make sure to update and refine your estimates as you get closer to your planned departure date."}
{"original": "For many people aspiring to retire early, getting and maintaining health insurance can be a major stumbling block. The reason: You're not eligible for Medicare until you hit 65. So if you retire before that date and don't have coverage through a former employer (or, if you're married, through a spouse's current or former employer), you'll have to buy health care coverage on your own. That can be a budget wrecker, which is why it's imperative you have a good idea of what the tab for health insurance will be before you actually leave your job."}
{"original": "Related: 3 things to know about health savings accounts"}
{"original": "Unfortunately, estimating what you'll pay for health insurance in the years ahead is a bit of a guessing game at the moment, what with the effort to repeal and replace Obamacare still a work in progress. But you can at least get a sense of what you might need to budget for coverage now by going to sites like eHealthInsurance.com and HealthPocket.com. You can then re-visit these sites as more details about health insurance costs emerge."}
{"original": "But make no mistake. You shouldn't even think of pulling the trigger on early retirement unless you're confident you'll have the resources to cover the cost of medical insurance as well as your potential health care costs overall."}
{"original": "Lifestyle planning, or thinking seriously about how you actually want to spend your time once you leave your job behind, is an important part of any retirement plan. It's especially crucial, however, if you're contemplating early retirement. After all, by retiring early you could easily be looking at a post-career life that will last as long, if not longer, than your career. Thus, if for no other reason than to avoid boredom or the feeling that you're just marking time, you'll want to do all you can to make this stage of your life rewarding and fulfilling."}
{"original": "Research shows that retirees who have a wide circle of friends tend to be happier in retirement. So in the years leading up your planned exit date, you'll want to consider a variety of ways to remain socially connected, such as reconnecting with old friends, making an effort to stay in touch with colleagues from work and even cultivating a new network of friends and acquaintances, say, by volunteering at a local charity or enrolling in adult-education classes. Starting a new hobby or throwing yourself into a new project --writing a book, launching a blog, learning a new language or musical instrument, etc.-- can also help engender a sense of purpose during a lengthy retirement."}
{"original": "Related: How to retire if you're going to live to 100"}
{"original": "Lifestyle planning can also help with the financial side of preparing for your early retirement, as the way you live in retirement can directly affect how much you'll spend and thus how large a nest egg you'll require. So as you're working on your retirement budget and gauging how much you need to save, you'll want to think about such issues as whether you plan to travel a lot or stick close to home and whether you intend to remain in your current house or downsize to smaller, less expensive digs in an effort to free up home equity and lower housing costs."}
{"original": "It's also important to remember that some lifestyle decisions have both social and financial dimensions. For example, choosing to work part-time can not only be a good way to earn a few extra bucks and reduce withdrawals from your nest egg, but an effective strategy for remaining socially engaged."}
{"original": "Clearly, there are other topics you'll have to address as you prepare to make your early exit. You'll want to be sure you're following a consistent investing strategy that jibes with your tolerance for risk, balances growth and downside protection and keeps expenses to a minimum. If you won't have enough savings in taxable accounts to fund the initial years of your retirement, then you'll also want to look into ways of tapping tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA while avoiding or minimizing early-withdrawal penalties. And you'll want to monitor your progress as you near your planned retirement date to gauge whether leaving your job at 55 is still realistic or whether you might be better off delaying a year or two."}
{"original": "But this much is certain: The sooner you create a plan and put it into action, the better the chance your early retirement dream will become a reality."}
{"original": "(CNN) On Monday morning, Illinois State House Speaker Mike Madigan made a stunning announcement: He would no longer try to get the 60 votes he needs to be elected to the post he has held almost continually since he first won it in 1983. Madigan represents one of the last vestiges of the old party boss system -- a man not terribly well-known outside of the city of Chicago but someone who, arguably, wields more influence than any other single figure in this massive Midwestern state."}
{"original": "In search of answers about how Madigan got here, I talked to Chicago Tribune political reporter Rick Pearson in December about Madigan -- and his future fate."}
{"original": "Cillizza: Explain, briefly the space Mike Madigan has occupied in Chicago Democratic politics for the last several decades."}
{"original": "Pearson: Madigan, 78, has been part of the fabric of city and state politics for more than a half century. He was born into the world of ward politics on the Southwest Side in the bungalow belt near Midway Airport where his father was a Democratic precinct captain. He also grew into the political patronage system, holding city jobs while becoming a trusted part of Mayor Richard J. Daley's machine."}
{"original": "In 1969, he was elected the youngest ward boss in the city at the age of 27. That year, Daley also tapped him to become a delegate to the convention that wrote the state's 1970 Constitution — its current governing document — as well as to keep an eye on another delegate, Daley's son, the future Mayor Richard M. Daley."}
{"original": "In 1970, Madigan was elected to the Illinois House, where he has served ever since. While city mayors came and went, Madigan continued to accumulate power and jobs through city and county allies, and in 1983 he became House speaker. He has held that post ever since, with the exception of 1995-1997 when Republicans took brief control of the chamber."}
{"original": "The year Madigan first became speaker also was the first year of the  Cutback Amendmen t , a voter-approved state constitutional amendment which created single-member House districts and reduced the size of the chamber by one-third. The real effect was to concentrate power -- and campaign money -- into the hands of the legislative leaders and Madigan proved to be a master fundraiser."}
{"original": "Governors both Republican and Democrat have acknowledged Madigan as the real power in Illinois politics -- through his ability to singularly control the fate of legislation and dictate the vote of his members being key to any politician's agenda. He would quash measures sought by Chicago mayors until he was able to extract concessions in return or punish them if they weren't offered. He made the local share of the state income tax temporary so that Mayor Richard M. Daley had to come back to him for help, allowing him to extract more from Daley."}
{"original": "Madigan also is a property tax assessment attorney, which has proved to be a lucrative business. In addition to representing major city businesses in appealing property taxes, getting a cut of any reduction, business leaders also know of Madigan's clout and offer property tax business as recognition."}
{"original": "Madigan also has further concentrated his power by holding the position of chairman of the Illinois Democratic Party, a post he was elected to in 1998. But unlike other states' party organizations which strive to be publicly active and take a role in national affairs, Madigan cared little about national politics -- even before Illinois turned into a reliably Democratic state on the presidential scene. Instead, he used the party as a closed operation to help further his Democratic majorities in areas that had been traditionally Republican -- such as the suburban collar counties which surround Chicago and Cook County."}
{"original": "Cillizza: Madigan is the longest-serving state speaker of the House in the country -- in power for all but two years since 1983. How has he managed to last so long amid so many changes within the Democratic Party?"}
{"original": "Pearson: On the old Star Trek series, there was a On the old Star Trek series, there was a 3-D chessboard . Consider Madigan to be the political grandmaster. For much of his career, Madigan was able to outmaneuver political adversaries on issues to the point of either sensing the tide on an issue and getting in front of it, waiting his opponents out or helping to defeat them."}
{"original": "But Madigan has also lasted because of his ability to change. At one time, citing his Roman Catholic faith, Madigan was opposed to abortion and his ideology could be viewed almost as a Blue Dog centrist-to-conservative Democrat. But with his ability to adapt, Madigan eventually oversaw progressive legislation making Illinois a leader in abortion rights, one of the first states to enact same-sex marriage before the US Supreme Court ruled and the 11th state to legalize recreational adult use of marijuana."}
{"original": "Progressive is still not a word used to describe Madigan. Madigan's primary goal [is] maintaining power and a Democratic legislative majority."}
{"original": "Cillizza: Has Madigan ever faced a real threat to his power? When and why?"}
{"original": "Pearson: Previously, the only threat Madigan faced to his power, aside from the two years when Republicans held the Illinois House, came under Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich and recently defeated one-term Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner."}
{"original": "Blagojevich sought to build alliances with then-Democratic Illinois Senate President Emil Jones to try to advance his agenda, though it was widely viewed as damaging to the state's economy and unaffordable. Blagojevich would tell Jones that no one viewed him as a power or respected him as Senate president because Madigan was widely regarded as the power in Illinois. This created tensions between Madigan and Jones, and Madigan ultimately used the House to kill off most of Blagojevich's ill-conceived initiatives. Those feelings were beneath the obvious issues that included trying to shake down a children's hospital and sell a US Senate seat that led to Blagojevich's eventual impeachment, removal from office and federal conviction."}
{"original": "Under Rauner, a wealthy equity investor, Madigan faced his toughest battles. Rauner used his cash to bankroll Republican legislative candidates, using ads calling Madigan corrupt and blaming Madigan for all of the perceived ills that had befallen Illinois. Rauner also backed a pro-business, anti-union agenda that sought to weaken one of Madigan's greatest sources of financial support — organized labor."}
{"original": "The ideological clash between the two led to Illinois going two years without a state budget with government funded through court orders that far outstripped available cash. Ultimately, Madigan won support from some Republicans for a budget and income tax increase in an attempt to repair the wreckage caused to social service agencies and places like Illinois colleges and universities."}
{"original": "Rauner lasted one term and lost to Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker in 2018."}
{"original": "Though Rauner has departed the political scene, his heavy spending and daily criticisms of Madigan inflicted serious damage. Once a figure that everyday Illinoisans never knew, Madigan has become viewed as extremely unpopular -- even before the federal investigation in which he has been implicated."}
{"original": "Cillizza: Why is this the moment that Madigan appears to be in real trouble in his effort to remain as speaker? Is all his history finally catching up with him?"}
{"original": "Pearson: Reflecting his ability to adapt, Madigan now finds a caucus with a large contingent of women members. But in 2018, cracks developed in support for : Reflecting his ability to adapt, Madigan now finds a caucus with a large contingent of women members. But in 2018, cracks developed in support for Madigan amid the #MeToo movement when he faced issues regarding sexual harassment in both his political and governmental operation. He discarded veteran political operatives including his longtime chief of staff, appointed more women to senior posts and promised to do more to prevent any recurrences."}
{"original": "But frustration with Madigan has been building with a younger, more progressive caucus straining under an autocratic style which lets members advance only a few of their bills per session."}
{"original": "Then in July, Commonwealth Edison, the state's largest electrical utility, agreed to pay a $200 million fine and cooperate with federal prosecutors in acknowledging its part of a near decade-long bribery and influence scheme, seeking to win Madigan's favor on legislation by giving jobs and contracts to Madigan's top allies."}
{"original": "On Wednesday, the former CEO of ComEd and once one of the city's most powerful businesswomen, Anne Pramaggiore, two other utility players and Madigan's top private sector confidant, lobbyist and former lawmaker Michael McClain, pleaded not guilty to charges associated with the scheme"}
{"original": "Rank-and-file Democratic lawmakers and candidates in the November 3 election said that as they tried to explain their positions on issues, voters repeatedly said their chief interest was what were they going to do about Madigan."}
{"original": "Distrust of Madigan was also cited as a factor in the defeat of the governor's signature agenda item, a proposed state constitutional amendment to change Illinois from a flat-rate income tax to a graduated-rate tax that rises with income, a system similar to the federal government and used by more than 30 states. Opponents, largely funded by business interests, continually raised the question of do you trust politicians with more tax money? The amendment was rejected overwhelmingly by voters in a hugely expensive campaign."}
{"original": "Pritzker contends the amendment's loss is in part due to Madigan and has said he should consider stepping down . US Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber's leadership, also said the party paid a heavy price for Madigan's leadership after his favored local congressional candidate, Betsy Dirksen Londrigan of Springfield, was defeated by four-term US Rep. Rodney Davis of Taylorville. Davis tarred Londrigan with ads associating her with Madigan."}
{"original": "Madigan had always been viewed on the outside as smart enough to avoid being caught in the city and state's history of corruption. He has not been charged with any wrongdoing. He doesn't have a cell phone or use email. He said he retains sizable support in his caucus and will seek reelection as speaker and doesn't intend to step down."}
{"original": "But in politics, perception caries a great deal of weight and the public perception of Madigan is now being joined by at least 19 members of his expected 73-member majority in the new General Assembly that convenes in January. Rather than a leader, the dissidents consider him a hindrance and a distraction."}
{"original": "Cillizza: Finish this sentence: In January the next Speaker of the Illinois state House will be ________. Now, explain."}
{"original": "Pearson: I don't mean to weasel out here but this is very much an open question. In the past, there were heirs apparent to Madigan should he have stepped down. But Madigan has outlasted them. The women's caucus is sizable and has now become a political force. The Black caucus in the House has always been influential. Progressives have become a larger factor in the chamber and they will want to be represented. Members of Madigan's current leadership team want consideration."}
{"original": "President Donald Trump has repeatedly promised that Mexico would pay for the border wall, a pledge he made starting on the campaign trail."}
{"original": "Now he's demanding that Congress come up with more than $5 billion to build a wall. He'll make a prime-time address Tuesday night, making his case to the public that a wall is needed to address what the administration views as a national security and humanitarian crisis along the Mexico-US border."}
{"original": "But even as the government remains shut down due to a fight over the money, the President continues to suggest that Mexico will ultimately pay for some of the wall through his revamped North American Free Trade Agreement, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement."}
{"original": "Mexico is paying for the Wall through the new USMCA Trade Deal. Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built. We have done a lot of work. $5.6 Billion Dollars that House has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of National Security. Quick payback! Trump tweeted last week."}
{"original": "But the trade agreement wouldn't necessarily bring more money into US coffers, as Trump has suggested."}
{"original": "It's extremely implausible, said Phil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs who served as a senior economist for trade under President George W. Bush."}
{"original": "The USMCA could potentially create more economic activity, and in turn raise tax revenue. The Trump administration has said new rules on auto production would bring manufacturing jobs back to the US."}
{"original": "But for now, it's unclear what kind of impact the deal will have on the American economy. It could potentially eliminate some jobs, too. The US International Trade Commission is investigating the economic impact of the deal, but it has until mid-March to publish its report."}
{"original": "Even if the USMCA ends up raising tax revenue, there's nothing earmarking that money for a wall. Income and corporate taxes are general revenue that would have to be appropriated by Congress."}
{"original": "Another way trade could bring money into the Treasury is through tariffs – which are paid by American importers when they buy foreign goods. But like the original North American Free Trade Agreement, the new deal aims to keep trade between the three countries largely tariff-free."}
{"original": "There's not that much in the new deal that looks radical and new. You're already starting with free trade across the two borders, Levy said."}
{"original": "Plus, the USMCA hasn't been ratified by Congress yet, and it's unclear whether it will get the votes. It's unlikely that the Democrats, who now control the House, will be eager to hand a victory to Trump, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she would like to see stronger enforcement measures for the labor and environment provisions in the deal."}

{"original": "Debt collectors are coming ... for your years-overdue unpaid federal taxes."}
{"original": "The IRS said Tuesday it would start sending letters out this month to taxpayers whose longtime unpaid tax debts are being farmed out to authorized private debt collection firms."}
{"original": "The private debt collection program was created by a federal law enacted by Congress in December 2015."}
{"original": "The IRS told reporters that for the first month they plan to send out 100 letters a week. Assuming there are no problems with that process, the plan is to then start issuing 1,000 letters a week thereafter."}
{"original": "Of course, whenever debt collection is outsourced to the private sector by a government agency, that can provide a boon to scammers posing as federal agents or as the approved debt collection firms."}
{"original": "So here's what every taxpayer needs to know to avoid getting duped by con artists:"}
{"original": "You'll hear from the IRS first."}
{"original": "If your case will be farmed out to a private collection firm, the IRS will notify you and your tax representative first by letter. That letter will include the name of the firm you'll be dealing with, along with the firm's contact information. Then the designated firm will send its own letter confirming that it will handle your case."}
{"original": "Initial contact won't be by phone."}
{"original": "To protect the taxpayer's privacy and security, both the IRS letter and the collection firm's letter will contain information that will help taxpayers identify the tax amount owed and assure taxpayers that future collection agency calls they may receive are legitimate, the IRS said."}
{"original": "You'll only be contacted if you have longstanding tax debts."}
{"original": "Here's a simple rule to keep in mind. You won't get a call from a private collection firm unless you have unpaid tax debts going back several years and you've already heard from the IRS multiple times, said IRS Commissioner John Koskinen."}
{"original": "Only four firms are authorized by the IRS."}
{"original": "They are: CBE Group of Cedar Falls, Iowa; Conserve Of Fairport, New York; Performant of Livermore, California, and Pioneer of Horseheads, New York. Affected taxpayers will only be assigned to one of them. If you get a call or a letter from a different firm, they are not working with the IRS."}
{"original": "They can identify themselves as IRS contractors."}
{"original": "The private collection firms' agents who work on taxpayer cases are not IRS employees. But they are working on the federal government's behalf and should indicate that. And they must be courteous and must respect taxpayer rights, according to the agency."}
{"original": "Related: What happens when you can't pay what you owe the IRS"}
{"original": "Only send payments directly to the IRS."}
{"original": "You should never be asked to send payment to the firm or to anyone other than the IRS or U.S. Treasury. All checks must be made payable to the United States Treasury."}
{"original": "Anyone calling and demanding immediate payment by prepaid debit card, gift card or wire transfer -- or asking for your credit card or debt card number -- is a fraud. Hang up."}
{"original": "The debt collectors still have to follow the rules."}
{"original": "The collection agencies must follow all the provisions of The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which protects consumers from abusive collection practices. For instance, debt collectors can't call a person's work, threaten harm or use profane language. And the times they may call are limited to certain hours."}
{"original": "The collectors also are not authorized to take enforcement actions against taxpayers (e.g., filing a notice of a federal tax lien or issuing a levy)."}
{"original": "File a complaint if you've been mistreated."}
{"original": "If you feel your taxpayer rights have been violated or if you've fallen prey to a tax scammer, the IRS recommends registering your complaint with the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration."}
{"original": "You also may want to register your complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has a database of more than 700,000 complaints, a quarter of which pertain to debt collectors."}
{"original": "Another reason to offer feedback: The program is essentially an experiment being watched closely not only by the IRS but by lawmakers. Also keeping an eye out will be the National Taxpayer Advocate and the Treasury employees' union, both of whom have expressed strong reservations about the program's cost-effectiveness and how it's structured, among other things."}
{"original": "The U.S. dollar started 2018 on the wrong foot, hitting its lowest point since mid-September."}
{"original": "In fact, the greenback lost value for almost all of 2017. It plummeted despite factors that typically drive up the dollar, like the passage of tax cuts and an overall healthy U.S. economy."}
{"original": "But compared to the world's most traded currencies, the dollar fell nearly 10% last year. It's down 2% since December 15, according to the ICE dollar index."}
{"original": "Political turmoil stemming from the 2016 election, better global growth and uncertainty over whether the tax bill would even happen pushed the dollar south to start last year."}
{"original": "But more recently, experts say dimmed expectations for the tax bill's impact on the U.S. economy, along with international factors, have caused the dollar to continue drifting down."}
{"original": "Related: Workers see fewer chances of promotion and raises"}
{"original": "People are accepting the idea that tax cuts are boosting near-term growth but won't change the long-term growth potential of the U.S. economy, says Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, a private bank."}
{"original": "The tax bill cut corporate taxes significantly and lowered taxes for many individuals, especially wealthy Americans. However, CEOs have said they don't plan to go on a hiring or spending spree because of the tax cuts. And economists often point out that rich people tend to save, not spend, the extra cash they get from lower taxes."}
{"original": "A broader global trend also hit the dollar in 2017. For years after the financial crisis, the United States was one of the lone bright spots in the global economy with robust job growth and consistent, albeit slow, economic growth."}
{"original": "With the U.S. as the main engine for the global recovery, the dollar strengthened nearly 13% in 2014, 9% in 2015 and another 3.5% in 2016, according to the ICE index."}

{"original": "As a result of better growth, central banks, particularly in the U.K. and Europe are catching up to the U.S.'s Fed by raising rates.

{"original": "The tax bill could have an additional negative impact on the dollar. If middle class Americans decide to spend the money they received from tax savings, they'll almost certainly buy products -- like iPhones -- made overseas. If that trend boosts imports more than exports, the dollar could go down some more."}

Incoming White House chief of staff Mark Meadows is also staying home until Wednesday despite his test coming back negative. Another Trump friend, Rep. Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican, was pictured shaking hands with the President on Friday."}
{"original": "Revelations that the disease was only one step removed from the President himself underlined how its advance could put any American at risk and are unlikely to quell public anxiety. They also underscore the elevated risk to politicians whose work necessarily brings them into contact with large numbers of people -- especially in the heat of a general election year."}
{"original": "The drama is focusing attention on the fact that the three men left vying for the White House are all in their mid-to-late 70s -- a group with a high set of risk factors for coronavirus complications."}
{"original": "The issue of Trump's health coincided with an alarming day as the number of infected Americans rose above 700 , hard-hit Italy went into total lockdown and Wall Street stocks crashed to their worst day since the Great Recession amid widening fears that the crisis could tip the economy into a recession. The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday asked all personnel based at its headquarters to work from home due to an employee who may have the virus, becoming the first federal agency to ask its Washington employees to stay home."}

{"original": "Top White House officials have tried to dispense calm amid rising panic, promising significant measures to stimulate the economy and pointing out that the risk to most Americans remained low."}
{"original": "But their task was completed by a new volley of chaos, political recrimination and confusion spun around the coronavirus pandemic by the President himself in a prolonged Twitter spree."}
{"original": "Virus is already changing American life"}
{"original": "The spectacle of the virus forcing the isolation of some people who regularly spend time with the President reflects how fast the parameters of normal life are changing."}
{"original": "After all, Trump spends his life surrounded by Secret Service agents equipped with the most sophisticated technology to ward off all kinds of threats with every potential risk gamed out in advance. But all of that may offer little protection from a virus that is easily transmitted and is spreading around the world."}
{"original": "Gaetz learned soon after the Air Force One took off about his contact with the patient at the Conservative Political Action Conference . He then decided to self-quarantine as a precaution."}
{"original": "But White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement that Trump was not tested because he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms."}
{"original": "President Trump remains in excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him, Grisham said."}
{"original": "Vice President Mike Pence, who also was at the conference, revealed that he was not tested either. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona earlier revealed they came into contact with the infected man and were self-quarantining as a precaution."}
{"original": "Gaetz's office tweeted that he had been tested even though he was not experiencing any symptoms and expected results soon."}
{"original": "The encounters with the infected man all occurred at CPAC -- a pro-Trump conference outside Washington late last month that ironically rang with claims that the media was inflating the threat of coronavirus to damage the President politically."}
{"original": "Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist, said the protocols on testing for the President and vice president were not surprising."}
{"original": "To be fair, the norm would be you would test the direct contact, so the person who actually shook hands with the person with coronavirus, Gounder said on CNN's Erin Burnett OutFront."}
{"original": "You would only test the President and others if their direct contacts were testing positive. Now the exception to that would be if the President or others developed symptoms, then you would probably go ahead and test."}
{"original": "Still, the President holds special symbolic value and occupies the highest public trust in the nation, so questions about his health are always elevated -- even in less fraught times. He has his own physician in the White House and his health is more closely watched than that of the average American."}
{"original": "Trump seems to be making few concessions to the virus. He shook hands with well-wishers during a weekend in Florida that included a fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago resort."}
{"original": "His potential rivals in November, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, also campaigned on the eve of the Super Tuesday II primaries that could go a long way to deciding the destiny of the nomination."}

{"original": "The drama regarding Trump's inner circle came on a day when Pence struggled to smooth over the confusion and disinformation sown about the virus by the President himself."}
{"original": "His efforts in a White House news conference reflect Trump's refusal to play the role of calming honest broker traditionally expected of a President during a national crisis."}
{"original": "Trump briefly appeared before reporters Monday evening as part of a news conference clearly designed to stem raging stock market contagion after a historic rout on Wall Street fears and rising anxiety about the toll of the virus as it crosses the nation."}
{"original": "He vowed the package will be very, very dramatic and we have a great economy, we have a strong economy, but this blindsided the world and I think we've handled it very, very well."}
{"original": "Trump promised a raft of measures -- including payroll tax cuts, sick leave for hourly workers and support for the travel industry -- and a fuller news conference on Tuesday. The most expansive proposals would require congressional approval and it is not clear whether Trump's proposals will win favor with Democrats in the House and Republicans in the Senate."}
{"original": "Pence then conducted an orthodox news conference, surrounded by experts and top officials, that bore little resemblance to divisive, misleading Trump Twitter tirade only hours earlier."}
{"original": "It is important to remember what President Trump said -- we are all in this together, Pence said."}
{"original": "The vice president also insisted, after his obligatory praise for Trump's management of the crisis, that the President had made it a priority to get sick passengers off a cruise ship that docked in Oakland, California, after days in limbo at sea."}
{"original": "In fact, on Friday, the President had suggested he'd prefer the passengers remained on the ship to avoid inflating the numbers of coronavirus sufferers in official figures on US soil."}
{"original": "Hours earlier, Trump had taken to Twitter to suggest coronavirus was far less problematic than seasonal flu, accused Democrats of weaponizing the crisis and media of inflaming it."}
{"original": "Yet the vice president asked those same journalists — who the President sees as purveyors of fake news -- to perform the public service of transmitting details of new government public health guidelines and to publicize a new website: coronavirus.gov."}
{"original": "The message delivered by Pence and top officials is that almost all Americans who get the virus will not die and that the economy will be just fine."}
{"original": "Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the strong US economy could ride out the pandemic."}
{"original": "This is not like the financial crisis, where we don't know the end in sight, he said. This is about providing proper tools and liquidity to get through the next few months"}
{"original": "While Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters that 2.1 million tests were shipped, waiting to be shipped or ordered, some state officials warned that there still wasn't sufficient capacity to track the spread of the virus."}

{"original": "We shouldn't have started in this position anyway, he said. I mean, we saw China happening. It was no secret. We knew someone was going to get on an airplane in China and come to the United States. That we're saying that China actually had faster testing capacity than we have is not acceptable to me."}

{"original": "Bush, Gore kick off fall campaign season with appeal to working families Candidates trade jabs over debate schedule NAPERVILLE, Illinois (CNN) -- The major presidential candidates kicked off the fall campaign season Monday with appeals to working Americans as they again accused each other of ducking presidential debates. Democratic nominee Al Gore marked Labor Day with unionized workers during a round-the-clock campaign blitz and Republican rival George W. Bush touted his tax-cut plan while stumping through Midwestern states Monday. As we come down to the stretch, we're ready for the contest. We feel great about our chances, Bush said during a rally Monday in Naperville, Illinois. Bush and his running mate, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, arrived in the GOP-friendly Chicago suburb early Monday to take part in the town's Labor Day parade. The duo then parted ways, with Bush heading to Romeo, Michigan, for the state's annual peach festival and Cheney attending a Polish food fair in Chicago. Deadlocked in the polls with Gore, Bush plans to visit nine cities this week in Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Indiana and Ohio -- states that represent 107 electoral votes, and which polls indicate are up for grabs. His stump speeches have reflected a growing sense of urgency in recent weeks, and have been increasingly peppered with attacks on his Democratic rival's ties to ethical problems that have plagued the Clinton administration."}
{"original": "It's time to elect people who say what they mean and mean what they say when they tell the American people something, Bush said Monday. It's time to get rid of all those words like 'no controlling legal authority.' Gore used the phrase to defend the practice of making telephone fund-raising calls from his White House office during the 1996 presidential campaign. The vice president charged the calls to a private credit card, and said there was no controlling legal authority that forbid raising political donations from government property. Bush focused on familiar stump themes such as education and military readiness during his Labor Day speech, and described his across-the-board tax-cut proposals as aimed at helping working-class families. The surplus doesn't exist because of the ingenuity and hard work of the federal government. The surplus exists because of the ingenuity and hard work of the American working people, Bush said, countering Gore claims that his 10-year, $1.3 trillion plan is too costly. He said that Gore's targeted tax cut proposals, aimed at helping low- and middle-class Americans through deductions for education, health care, and child care expenses, would likely by forgotten after the November election. If you remember in 1992, they said give us a chance, we will have targeted tax cuts for the middle class. And now they have to say it again, Bush said. Just prior to his speech, Bush was heard using an expletive to describe a New York Times reporter -- the author of several articles Bush campaign regarded as unfair."}
{"original": "Standing on stage, Bush leaned over to vice presidential running mate Dick Cheney and said There's Adam Clymer, major league a------ from The New York Times. Cheney replied, Oh, yeah, big time. Neither man was apparently aware that their remarks could be picked up by an open microphone on the podium. When asked about the exchange, Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said that Bush comment was meant to be a whispered aside to his running mate. It was not intended to be a public comment. Gore rallies steel workers Gore continued a six-day, 27-hour frenzy of campaigning designed to reach out to core Democratic supporters with a pitch to union workers during an outdoor rally in Pittsburgh. Continuing his populist message, Gore renewed his pledge to raise the minimum wage, build more public schools, secure passage of a patients' bill of rights and provide prescription drug coverage for seniors under the government's Medicare program. Speaking to thousands of steelworkers, Gore tried to label Bush's tax-cut plans as a boon for the wealthiest Americans. What it all comes down to is whether or not we're going to fight for those who most need the help, Gore told the cheering crowd. Also on hand at the rally were civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and AFL-CIO leader John Sweeney. Sweeney lined up an early AFL-CIO endorsement of Gore during the presidential primary season despite differences with the vice president on global trade issues, most recently his support for permanent normalized trade relations with China."}
{"original": "Eight years of Clinton-Gore haven't been enough to repair the damage of 12 years of Reagan and Bush, Sweeney told the crowd. Al Gore is running for president as the champion of working families and unions. From Pittsburgh, Gore heads to Louisville, Kentucky, for a rally at an outdoor motor speedway. It's the final stop on a non-stop tour that began yesterday in Philadelphia. After late night stop in Michigan, Gore and running mate Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut arrived in Florida in the pre-dawn hours of Monday. The vice president headed to an all-night coffee shop to chat with waitresses while Lieberman visited a bakery. We decided that in the wee hours of Labor Day ... we'd reconnect with our roots, Gore told a dawn rally. It was very moving for me. Gore and Lieberman later had breakfast with firefighters at a Hispanic neighborhood fire station in one of the city's busiest districts. This crowd is a crowd that looks like America, said Gore. As Gore headed for Pittsburgh, Lieberman returned to Michigan to attend a Labor Day festival in Detroit. If you ever wondered whether Michigan is central to what happens in this election, I've been here three times in the last week and twice in the last 10 hours, Lieberman told cheering union workers. Sniping continues over debates Bush and Gore have not yet agreed when and where to formally debate this fall, and the long-distance debate over the debates extended into Monday's events."}
{"original": "Gore's campaign rejected the Texas governor's offer on Sunday to participate in three presidential debates -- two of which would take place on television shows. Gore insisted Monday that Bush must first accept the three 90-minute debates proposed by the Commission on Presidential Debates. This is not about what is best for George W. Bush or what is best for Al Gore. It's about what's best for the American people, said Gore, who argued that commission debates will reach the widest possible viewing audience. Under the Bush camp's proposals, presidential debates would take place on NBC's Meet the Press, hosted by Tim Russert, and CNN's Larry King Live. The third would be hosted by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which has organized the quadrennial face-offs since 1988. On Monday, the Bush campaign emphasized that Gore, regarded by many as a skilled and seasoned debater, had already accepted the CNN and NBC offers among dozens of others. My opponent said he would debate me anyplace, anytime, anywhere, Bush said. I said, 'Fine. Why don't we just show up ... and discuss our differences?' All of a sudden the words 'anytime, anywhere' don't mean anything. In addition to the three debates featuring the presidential candidates, Bush's campaign proposed two between their running mates. But Gore campaign chairman William Daley said the Republican presidential candidate's debate plan would shortchange Americans by cutting tens of millions of people out of the presidential debate audience, and Gore called Bush's plan a disappointment."}
{"original": "I'm very disappointed in this reaction, because what's needed is to respect the right of the American people to see these debates on all the networks in prime time the way it is has been done since 1988, Gore told reporters. Under the commission's proposal -- which Gore has accepted -- the first debate would take place in Boston on October 3, at the University of Massachusetts' John F. Kennedy Library; the second October 11, at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina; and the third October 17, at Washington University in St. Louis. The commission proposed a vice presidential debate for October 5 in Danville, Kentucky, at Centre College."}

{"original": "The bottom line: The divide you are seeing rip through the Republican Party right now isn't between conservatives and moderates. This isn't the Freedom Caucus vs. leadership. It's not even as simple as members who might run for President in 2024 vs. those who will not. What you are seeing right now is a gamble members are taking on whether the GOP can finally shake Trump going forward or whether there is no way to win the White House again without him on their side."}
{"original": "Republican aides and members opposed to this effort are watching this play out and hoping that voters will have moved on from Trump in the next several years. The hope is that this vote does not become a litmus test for whether outside groups wage primary challenges against those who were not loyal to the President in his last days in office. Only time will tell how consequential this vote will really be. Still, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has warned members that for him, it is one of the most important of his career."}
{"original": "The heartburn for members right now"}
{"original": "the For four years, and with exception of a few Republican members who have been more outspoken against Trump on a consistent basis, rank-and-file members have fallen in line behind Trump."}
{"original": "McConnell has undoubtedly been an ally, pushing through three Supreme Court justices for the President, remaking the courts and orchestrating a massive tax overhaul. Lawmakers gave Trump money for a wall. They waited out every impulse, tried hard not to see bombastic tweets, and now, if members aren't with the President on overturning the election, they are being ridiculed and attacked by him as if they never walked the line for him in the past."}
{"original": "Republican members and aides who had considered themselves allies of Trump on Capitol Hill aren't surprised the President demands loyalty, but they're clearly frustrated by the position they are in."}
{"original": "It is disappointing this vote has become the exclusive litmus test for whether or not a member of Congress stands with President Trump, Sen. Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, said in a statement. One would have a hard time finding a more fervent, consistent, longstanding supporter of this President than I have been since he first announced his candidacy."}
{"original": "As one Republican aide put it to me, every member who is following Trump down this path to overturn the election has to remember that it will all be for nothing if they ever disagree with Trump down the line."}

{"original": "A joint session of Congress will convene at 1 p.m. ET. Members are being encouraged to watch the proceedings remotely given the pandemic, but it's just as likely that the chamber will be packed. Leadership offices have warned there is little they can do to discourage members from showing up for what is expected to be a historic moment."}
{"original": "The expectation is that Vice President Mike Pence will preside over the session. He was spotted meeting with the Senate's parliamentarian Sunday. Then, the four tellers: Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Republican Rep. Rodney Davis of Illinois and Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California will read and tally the votes from every state in alphabetical order."}
{"original": "This can be sped up if there is agreement: The entire process, for example, took just 40 minutes in 2017."}
{"original": "At each state, the vice president, in his role as the president of the Senate, will call to ask if there are any objections. If there is an objection it will have to come from one senator and one member of the House and be turned over in writing. At that point, the joint session breaks up, and both chambers debate separately for up to two hours. They will then vote on the objection and resume the joint session."}
{"original": "Given the safety protocols in the House of Representatives for voting, we expect that this process will take much longer for the House to get through every time the joint session is interrupted. Only twice have there been a formal Senate and House objection to the the tally. Once in 1969 and once in 2005. Both objections were voted down."}
{"original": "We still don't know how many official objections there will be. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican of Missouri, has made it clear he will object to at least Pennsylvania's results, but a source familiar with his thinking has said he is still reviewing whether he will object to other states as well. There is a long list of House members willing to sign onto objections from senators, but a senator has to sign on to make it a viable debate."}
{"original": "Without knowing how many states might be objected to, there is no way to predict how long Wednesday will go. We may get more clarity on Tuesday, but we may have to watch this play out in real time. I am told by a Senate GOP source that Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and the 11 members who signed a statement Saturday saying they will support objections are still considering whether they will object to particular states or merely vote for the objections that Hawley brings. The outcome of the Georgia election could also factor into senators' thinking: If GOP Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue both win, does that change the calculus for whether members want to challenge the state of Georgia, for example? Will members be ready to move on more quickly?"}
{"original": "There's still a lot we don't know about how Wednesday will unfold. The mechanics of the day, while clearly spelled out by law, give individual members a lot of power over how long they can drag this out."}
{"original": "For years, McConnell has managed to keep his conference together through fights over the Supreme Court, a tax overhaul and even the passage of some of the largest stimulus packages in the country's history. He's legendary for his ability to use arcane Senate procedures to realize his political ambitions. The failure to repeal and replace Obamacare one of the only true defeats McConnell has suffered in his Senate tenure."}
{"original": "But the vote Wednesday was always outside his control. While he privately urged his members to stay away from it, cognizant it could affect members up for reelection in 2022, McConnell has largely told members to vote their conscience now that the vote will occur. Members and aides say McConnell has been a sounding board for members on the fence, but he realizes he cannot ultimately control the whims of every office. That's never been his style."}

{"original": "Now there's an all-new version of the Leaf with more sophisticated styling and more range than before. And its $30,000 price tag still undercuts the competition from Tesla (TSLA) and General Motors (GM) -- although those cars still go farther on a charge."}
{"original": "The biggest advantage of the Leaf is that you won't have to wait until sometime next year to get one. Just saying."}
{"original": "The Leaf isn't particularly fun to drive, the way most EVs are. The Leaf is the mild sauce version of an electric vehicle. Part of that is because it has less power. With electric cars, bigger batteries mean more driving range, but they also mean more power and punchier acceleration. So it might be no surprise the Leaf feels less exciting."}
{"original": "To be honest, most Nissan cars are pretty dull these days. I'm not sure why but over the past few years, Nissan has decided to put all the excitement into its cars' exterior design -- they look pretty sharp. The engineers seem to focus purely on fuel economy and comfort, and in that respect the Leaf fits right in. The suspension is tuned for comfort and the steering feels as sharp as a Play Doh knife. If you don't mind that, and lots of people won't, you won't mind the Leaf."}
{"original": "Its 151 miles of range isn't as much as more expensive EVs, but I was able to comfortably get through an entire weekend of ordinary errand running, plus a round-trip commute to work, without recharging. (One thing you learn driving electric cars is that most of us don't travel nearly as many miles each day as we think.)"}
{"original": "The Leaf's interior design is also less exciting than the Model 3's or even the Bolt EV's. Beyond a shiny puck-shaped gear selector, most of the it feels like it could be in any Nissan economy car. There is a nice and fairly large touchscreen, but there's nothing that makes you feel like you just leaped into the future."}
{"original": "The Leaf does have the ProPilot Assist feature, which is available as an option on the Leaf and some other Nissan models. Think of it as Tesla's Autopilot on a budget. It's also largely similar to driver assistance systems from Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, Lexus and others."}
{"original": "The driver has to keep hands on the steering wheel, but ProPilot will do the work of keeping the car in the center of its lane. (It won't change lanes for you like systems on some more expensive cars will.) It also maintains a distance behind traffic ahead. By itself, it's not revolutionary -- more expensive systems are smoother and feel more natural, but what's impressive is to find it on such an affordable vehicle."}
{"original": "The Leaf is roomy for its size, comfortable, practical and a good value at its price, particularly when tax benefits are factored in. Is it exciting? No. But it provides a view to the future when people will buy electric cars just because they make sense not because they're cool."}
{"original": "Get ready to pay more for beer and tomatoes if Donald Trump gets Congress to approve a tax on Mexican imports."}
{"original": "His press secretary Sean Spicer said Thursday that one way to get Mexico to pay for a border wall would be to impose a 20% tariff on goods imported from there. Such a tax would fall on a wide variety of products."}
{"original": "There's no question America imports a lot of cars and car parts from Mexico. The U.S. brought in $21.5 billion worth of motor vehicles from Mexico in the first 11 months of last year, accounting for 8% of total imports from Mexico, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. Auto parts, the single largest product imported from Mexico, reached about $51.6 billion through November, and accounted for 19% of all products shipped from Mexico."}
{"original": "Related: Remove car imports and and the trade gap with Mexico disappears"}
{"original": "But the United States gets a whole lot more than just cars and parts from its southern neighbor. It is our third largest supplier of goods overall, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative."}
{"original": "The imports include finished items that can hit store shelves or showrooms and parts that American manufacturers use to produce other goods, said Robert Lawrence, a professor of international trade and investment at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Mexican auto parts are found in virtually all 11 million cars made in the United States. We also import a lot of oil from Mexico - about 200 million barrels in the first 11 months of 2016, at a cost of about $7 billion."}
{"original": "Related: A 20% Mexican tariff would pay for the wall. But it would hurt Americans"}
{"original": "It's not clear whether Congress will go along with a tariff on Mexican goods, or whether Trump will go ahead with the threat. During his confirmation hearing last week, Steven Mnuchin, Trump's nominee to be treasury secretary, said he in no way wanted to impose a broad tariff on all Mexican goods, only a tax aimed at companies that shift jobs south of the border. That couldn't be further from anything he'd possibly consider, he said when he was asked about a tax on Mexican goods. And the White House soon walked back Spicer's remark on Thursday."}
{"original": "But even the threat of an additional levy on products can send shivers through American firms. And it would interfere with the vast supply network between the two countries, Lawrence said."}
{"original": "American companies import a lot of computer and electronic equipment, from monitors to telephones to insulated wires to electric generators. These are among the top 30 products brought in from Mexico, according to the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database."}
{"original": "Another major source of Mexican imports are appliances, including refrigerators, air conditioners and centrifuges."}

{"original": "But Carrier and its parent, United Technologies (UTX), is still going ahead with plans to move about 1,300 other Indiana jobs to Mexico."}
{"original": "Mexico also grew $21 billion of agricultural products shipped and eaten in the U.S. in 2015, making it our second largest supplier."}
{"original": "Among the most popular are avocados, tomatoes and berries. We bring in $4.8 billion of fresh vegetables, as well as $1.7 billion in snack foods and $1.4 billion in processed fruit and vegetables, according to the nation's trade representative."}
{"original": "And then there's that Mexican beer that Americans love so much. Corona. Modelo Especial. Dos Equis. The U.S. imported $2.8 billion of beer from Mexico in 2015, according to the U.N. database, making it the 15th most popular import."}
{"original": "This vast array of items could be subject to a 20% levy if Trump makes good on his threat."}
{"original": "The notion that a 20% tariff is a way of forcing Mexico to pay for the wall, it's just a falsehood. It's a way of forcing American consumers to pay for the wall, says Edward Alden, a trade expert at the Council on Foreign Relations."}
{"original": "Besides driving up prices for consumers, a tariff could also hurt American jobs -- 40% of the parts in a typical Mexican product originate in the United States, according to the Commerce Department, so cutting down on those imports could cut down on demand for those American parts."}

The question is, how far offshore an whether in fact, we escort them with our own fighters."}
{"original": "BLITZER: Well, wouldn't than be seen by the Chinese as very a provocative step if a U.S. fighter jets started accompanying these flights?"}
{"original": "BLITZER: And what would be the People's Liberation Army, the Chinese military, how presumably, will they respond to that kind of stuff?"}
{"original": "SHAMBAUGH: I doubt that they would challenge and intercept the flights, certainly not in as provocative a way as they apparently have been doing. If they were escorted, I think they would stay some ways away, but you know, it's really unpredictable. It's hard to say."}
{"original": "BLITZER: Are the Chinese -- is the Chinese leadership firmly convinced, as they say they are, that it was the U.S. fault for this collision?"}
{"original": "SHAMBAUGH: Well, there is some evidence that this is the story that the Chinese military told the Chinese leadership, indeed that the local Guangdong Chinese military region sent up the line. And once the Chinese leadership received that story, they put it out to their own people and to the world. And once you do that, you can't back down. Now they obviously have diametrically opposed information from the American side."}
{"original": "BLITZER: And some speculation the Chinese may even ask the U.S. for reparations for the family?"}
{"original": "SHAMBAUGH: I have heard suggestion of that. We'll see if they put that on the table tomorrow."}
{"original": "BLITZER: How in the big picture will all this affect U.S.- Chinese relations in the short term?"}
{"original": "SHAMBAUGH: Well, in the short term, I think it's going to leave a lot of scar tissue, if you want to call it that, on the relationship. Both sides were deeply suspicious of each other going into these last two weeks. Now I think the suspicions have hardened a bit, and we have Taiwan arms sales decisions coming up shortly and a number of other really very sensitive and delicate questions in the relationship. So, right now, it is a very fragile and suspicious time."}
{"original": "BLITZER: Professor David Shambaugh, thanks for joining us."}
{"original": "And he's pursued religious business and philanthropic interests in China for more than 20 years, and he has long called for closer U.S.-China relation along with improved trade ties. Earlier, I spoke with Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network and the Christian Coalition."}
{"original": "BLITZER (on camera): Pat Robertson, thanks for joining us on our program. And I want right to the issue at hand, namely China. Are you satisfied with the way the standoff with China was resolved?"}
{"original": "PAT ROBERTSON, RELIGIOUS BROADCASTER: Well, Wolf, I think the president handled himself very well on that. He was restrained. He didn't get us into some quagmire that we couldn't get out of."}
{"original": "But I'm really disappointed with the Chinese. If they want to get the Olympics in 2008 and they wanted to be treated as a member of the world community, they have to be more reasonable in the way they deal with people."}
{"original": "BLITZER: So, do you have a message to them right now, what you want to see them do as these negotiation begin on Wednesday in Beijing, how to avoid these kinds of collision down the road?"}
{"original": "ROBERTSON: Well, I'm a friend of China, but the Chinese must realize that they can't lay claim to the entire South China Sea, that they don't have hegemony all the way to Japan, that they don't own the Spratley islands, et cetera. And that the United States has a perfect right to patrol off the coast there in international waters, and they can't keep us from doing it."}
{"original": "The big thing is they must understand the United States has no hostile intentions toward China whatsoever, but we do have to monitor North Korea and we do have to protect our vital interests."}
{"original": "BLITZER: You know, some of the conservatives write -- like Bill Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard here in Washington -- insist that the Bush administration, in effect, allowed the United States to be humiliated with the letter, the expression of regrets, the very sorry twice reference. You don't necessarily agree with Bill Kristol?"}
{"original": "ROBERTSON: No, I really don't. I mean, listen, I've been over to China a number of times. I have some activity there and I have some spiritual activity in China, and, Wolf, there are 80 million Christians in China right now. There is a tremendous religious revival, and I have seen an emerging middle class come on in China that ultimately is going to win the day."}
{"original": "Granted, there are some old people that are still in power that look back to a previous age, but there's just too much that has been said in place by Deng Xiaoping that can't be reversed. And so, I think we need to encourage that, not stifle it."}
{"original": "BLITZER: How do you balance your historic support for closer relation with China, improved trade relations with China, with what many conservatives complain about, specifically the so-called forced abortions in China?"}
{"original": "ROBERTSON: Well, you know, I don't agree with it. But at the same time, they've got 1.2 billion people, and they don't know what to do. If every family over there was allowed to have three or four children, the population would be completely unsustainable."}
{"original": "Right now, they run the risk of a tremendous unemployment. There are some antiquated factories that the government owns that have to be shut down that is going to put hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people out of work. And the leadership is like on a teeter-totter board, they can fall off if the population gets too restive."}
{"original": "So, I think that right now they're doing what they have to do. I don't agree with the forced abortion, but I don't think the United States needs to interfere with what they're doing internally in this regard."}
{"original": "BLITZER: But in effect, won't your critics on the right be saying that Pat Robertson is justifying abortions in China?"}
{"original": "ROBERTSON: Well, I just think they need to get involved in what's happening."}
{"original": "But I'll tell you what the Chinese are doing, and it's going to be a demographic catastrophe. When they're having abortions, they're picking the girl babies for the slaughter, and they're allowing only the males to be born. And in another, say, 10 or 20 years, there's going to be a critical shortage of wives. The young men won't have any women to marry, so it will, in a sense, dilute the -- what they consider the racial purity of the Han Chinese."}
{"original": "And that to them will be a great tragedy, because then they will have to be importing wives from Indonesia and others countries in order to fill up the population."}
{"original": "BLITZER: Some also said that you're letting China off the hook too easily. They're pointing to what you said the other day on LARRY KING LIVE in the midst of the standoff. Let me read to you one of the statements that you did say then: What we ought to do is to say this was a wind draft, and blame it on the wind. Say it's an unfortunate thing. Find some fig leaf that both sides can put on and get on with life. It is too important to both countries to continue some sort of comity to blow it up on the basis of this one plane."}
{"original": "And the argument is that you're letting the Chinese simply off the hook?"}
{"original": "ROBERTSON: Wolf, I believe that's what it was. The pilot's name, interestingly enough, was Wang Wei. I mean, of all the ironies, Wang Wei, and he was a hot-dog pilot, and he crashed their plane. But the Chinese, in order to save face, don't want to admit it. So why not blame it on the wind, say it was a wind sheer? And then, both countries can continue their business, and we get our plane back, we get our pilots and our crew back, and we can continue some sort of a relationship."}
{"original": "I think to blow this incident into a potential war would be tragic, and that is what could happen."}
{"original": "BLITZER: What kind of grade would you give President Bush for his first 100 days in office?"}
{"original": "ROBERTSON: I would say a B-plus, A-minus, something like that. I think he's done quite well in most of the issues."}
{"original": "BLITZER: One of the issues that you've had some complaints about, some problems is the so-called faith-based initiative that he's put forward that would allow federal tax dollars to go to various religious organizations to provide social services. Do you still have a serious problem with that still?"}
{"original": "ROBERTSON: Wolf, I agree with the concept. It's a wonderful, noble concept that faith-based organization should have the same treatment as secular organizations. I mean, that goes without saying. They do a superb job."}
{"original": "The problem is the implementation. If the government forces these faith-based institutions to give up their unique distinctives and no longer preach the Gospel or read the Bible or have prayer or use spiritual counseling, if that's denied them, then of course the government will ruin the organizations."}
{"original": "So I just want to make sure that they're protected and I'm not sure that the Bush administration has fully thought through all the ramifications of current federal law in that regard."}
{"original": "BLITZER: OK, Pat Robertson, I want to thank you very much for joining us."}
{"original": "ROBERTSON: Thank you. It's a pleasure."}
{"original": "BLITZER: And this programming note: At the bottom of the hour, is China a partner or an adversary of the United States. Greta Van Susteren will have more on the tensions between the United States and China."}
{"original": "And up next, it's hard to believe that what we are about to report can still happen in the 21st century. But authorities in Africa are racing against time, searching for a ship with a human cargo: scores of children allegedly sold into slavery. We'll have a live report from the west coast of Africa."}
{"original": "And later, escalating violence in the Middle East. Israel strikes at Gaza after one of its towns is shelled, and Syria puts its forces in Lebanon on alert."}
{"original": "BLITZER: Welcome back. Authorities in West Africa are trying to bring an end to a nightmare voyage and the United States has agreed to help search for a ship believed to be carrying children sold into slavery. The vessel is thought to have departed, with its human cargo, from Benin two weeks ago."}
{"original": "It was turned away from Gabon and was last seen Thursday after being turned back from Cameroon. In an area which was once the center of the historic slave trade, poverty-stricken parents often turn their children over to traffickers and smugglers, who promise to find them jobs only to sell them into slavery."}
{"original": "As the vigil for this group of children continues, CNN's Stephanie Halasz joins us now live by satellite telephone from the port of Cotonou in Benin. Stephanie, first of all, tell us what's happening right now."}
{"original": "STEPHANIE HALASZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, just a few minutes ago, a vessel came to the port here. It rolled slowly down the port key and has just now come to a halt. It is called Eterino. That's the name that we have been looking for. That is the name of the cargo vessel that people believe carried the children numbered up to a hundred..."}
{"original": "BLITZER: Looks like we have lost our satellite communication with Stephanie."}
{"original": "Unfortunately we can't. What she -- what Stephanie was about to report was that a ship has now come into the port in Benin, and it's unclear whether this is the specific ship that is allegedly carrying those children who have supposedly been sold into slavery. We'll of course try to reconnect with Stephanie as soon as we can and bring the latest on what is going on."}
{"original": "And just ahead, if you haven't filed your taxes yet, don't worry. If you live on the East coast, you still have 3 1/2 hours. And if you still need a bit of extra help, you may be able to find it at an unlikely place, your grocery store. Stay with us."}

{"original": "Tonight on The Leading Edge, procrastinating taxpayers have just a few hours left to file their taxes. CNN national correspondent Gary Tuchman joins us now live from Atlanta, where the IRS is helping taxpayers with last-minute questions -- Gary."}
{"original": "GARY TUCHMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's right, Wolf. Grocery stores aren't just for shopping anymore. Here in the state of Georgia, the Internal Revenue Services has sent its employees to 32 Kroger grocery stores to help out with tax preparation for free. Each of these 32 stores is open until midnight. And you can see, there is a line of people wanting to get their tax prepared for free. They've waited for the last second in many cases, and that's why they're here."}
{"original": "Now, there are other programs in other states similar to this. But the IRS says Georgia is a model program, that there's more public/private cooperation in this state than any other state. One of the main reasons the IRS is doing this, to encourage people to e-file."}
{"original": "With us right now is Belinda McCafferty. She's with the Internal Revenue Service. Let me bring you over here Belinda so we can see you better if we can."}
{"original": "Belinda, let me ask you this: What percentage right now, nationally, do we have for e-filing this year?"}
{"original": "BELINDA MCCAFFERTY, IRS: Right now, we have 44 percent of the returns that have been filed have been filed electronically, and that's an increase over last year."}
{"original": "TUCHMAN: That's a big increase. So when people come here now, are there a lot of people who don't trust Internet e-filing and they want it on paper?"}
{"original": "MCCAFFERTY: Well, actually, we haven't had that many in this store that have not wanted the return filed electronically. The advantages clearly are that it's more accurate, and they get their tax refund faster."}
{"original": "TUCHMAN: That's an important point. You can't stress that enough. How much faster do you get your refund if you file on the Internet?"}
{"original": "MCCAFFERTY: If you file electronically, you'll get your refund in 10 to 12 days as opposed to six to eight weeks if you file it manually. So, that's a big advantage to filing electronically."}
{"original": "Right now around this time -- we're talking right now it's 8:24 p.m. Eastern Time. Most post offices are closed. So people are actually coming to these Kroger grocery stores to bring their checks if they owe money to the IRS."}
{"original": "We are told that last year five people brought checks to grocery stores for more than $1 million in taxes, including one man who brought a check for $3.2 million to the Kroger grocery store. Wolf, back to you."}
{"original": "BLITZER: Gary Tuchman in Atlanta, thank you very much."}

{"original": "But Michael from North Carolina has a very different view: He did send a message, and for us in the military, the protocol involved with the president would mean more personal working, security screening and having a huge ceremony. We know he supports us, but the intent was to get the individuals home with family."}
{"original": "Finally, Debbie in Tempe, Arizona, writes about the recent problems with China and Japan as well as in Cincinnati: While all three incidents differ in many ways, they have one thing in common.

{"original": "It is likely Apple will report more than a quarter of a trillion dollars in cash and investments on its balance sheet for the first time ever. Apple (AAPL) had a little more than $240 billion as of the end of December."}
{"original": "Apple's stack of Franklins, Grants and Jacksons has steadily grown over the past few years. Five years ago, Apple had just $110.2 billion in cash."}
{"original": "And Apple has increasingly stashed away its cash overseas for tax purposes. Apple CFO Luca Maestri said in February that $230 billion of its cash was held abroad."}
{"original": "But there are growing hopes that Apple might soon be able to bring back, or repatriate, this cash to the United States at a one-time lower tax rate if President Trump is able to get his tax plan through Congress."}

{"original": "Donald Trump bashed Eaton, an industrial conglomerate with its roots in Cleveland, on the campaign trail because it merged with an Irish company a few years ago and then moved its headquarters out of Ohio to Dublin, Ireland."}
{"original": "Such a move allowed Eaton to lower its corporate taxes since Ireland has a much lower corporate tax rate than the U.S. But the company also became a target of Trump during the campaign."}
{"original": "You know our companies are leaving our country, rapidly, rapidly, whether it's Carrier Air Conditioning, whether it's Ford, whether it's Eaton. I was in Cleveland and Eaton Corp., they're leaving, and so many companies are leaving, Trump said during his Super Tuesday speech last March."}
{"original": "Frankly, I'm disgusted with it and I'm tired of seeing it and there's no reason for it. It's just gross incompetence at the highest level. We should not allow it to happen, he added."}
{"original": "Eaton had been domiciled in Cleveland before it bought Ireland's Cooper Industries in 2012. The company was also a target of Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton. She called out Eaton for shutting a factory in Berea, Ohio, which led to the loss of more than 100 jobs."}
{"original": "Clinton also criticized the company for paying its former CEO Sandy Cutler more than $11 million."}
{"original": "President Obama also wasn't a fan of deals that let U.S. companies move overseas, a practice called inversions. Obama called inversions unpatriotic and described the practice as insidious."}

{"original": "But Eaton (ETN), which just reported its latest quarterly earnings on Thursday, isn't scared of these political attacks. In an interview with CNNMoney, CEO Craig Arnold defended his company's decision to expand globally."}
{"original": "The U.S. has only 5% of the world's population, said Arnold, who took over last June after Cutler retired. If you take the long-term view, the better growth opportunities lie outside of the U.S. -- despite what may happen in the short-term, Arnold said."}
{"original": "Arnold added that even if Trump and the Republican-led Congress wind up changing tax laws that would allow U.S. firms to pay a lower rate if they brought back cash overseas to America, he has no plans to move Eaton's headquarters back to Ohio."}
{"original": "The future of U.S. tax policy is a big uncertainty, he said, adding that based on current proposals he's seen, there is no reason to re-invert the company. Plus, we pay taxes on all our U.S. income, he said."}
{"original": "Arnold said he has not had any discussions with the president or anyone in Trump's administration since the election, but that he is open to having a dialogue -- just like many other businesses have been."}
{"original": "And Eaton still has a major presence in the U.S. It sells electrical equipment, construction equipment, hydraulics and trucking parts."}
{"original": "Eaton may not be a household name, per se, but it is no slouch. It just reported annual sales of nearly $20 billion and the company is worth more than $30 billion."}
{"original": "The company also said it was proud of its record on jobs, pointing out that it had about 74,000 workers before the Cooper deal closed in 2012 and now has about 95,000 employees."}
{"original": "But Eaton does not break down where those jobs are. And the company has closed several plants in Iowa, Wisconsin and Ohio during the past few years, like the one in Berea that Clinton cited. In some cases, jobs have been outsourced to Mexico."}

{"original": "That might be problematic for Eaton in the Trump era, especially as Eaton and its competitors try to win various parts of any infrastructure contracts that the government puts up for bidding -- assuming that the stimulus actually makes it through Congress."}
{"original": "Could the Trump administration hold back on giving Eaton federal contracts unless it pledges to hire more American workers -- or even move its headquarters back to the U.S.?"}
{"original": "Arnold said he is confident that there will be some form of stimulus -- and that his company would benefit."}
{"original": "But he also said he's a little concerned that investors -- and even companies -- are too optimistic about how much Trump will really be able to boost the economy."}
{"original": "We've spent a lot of time looking at stimulus. But until the reality of this enthusiasm shows up in our order books and our customers buy more, it's hard to predict how much it will impact us, Arnold said."}
{"original": "The industry has been too optimistic in the past. We're not great forecasters, Arnold added. We'll call the turn when we see it."}

{"original": "Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said on Sunday he is seriously considering running for president as a centrist independent in 2020."}
{"original": "We're living at a most fragile time, Schultz told CBS's Scott Pelley in a 60 Minutes interview that aired on Sunday. Not only the fact that this President is not qualified to be the president, but the fact that both parties are consistently not doing what's necessary on behalf of the American people and are engaged every single day in revenge politics."}

{"original": "A person close to Schultz's advisers said his team is exploring a possible independent bid for the presidency in 2020, but the person emphasized that all options remained on the table."}
{"original": "(Schultz) is thinking deeply about his future and how he can best serve the country, the person said."}
{"original": "Schultz, who describes himself as a lifelong Democrat, stepped down as chairman and CEO of Starbucks last year, and said at the time he was exploring what he could do next to be most helpful to the future of America."}
{"original": "If Schultz enters the 2020 race, he would join a growing list of candidates including California Sen. Kamala Harris, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, and former secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro. Additionally, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York have formed exploratory committees for a bid."}
{"original": "Several Democrats have voiced concern over a potential Schultz White House bid, including Castro on Sunday morning."}
{"original": "Castro told CNN's Jake Tapper on State of the Union, he is concerned that if Schultz runs it would provide Donald Trump with his best hope of getting re-elected."}
{"original": "Castro said Trump's only hope at getting re-elected is if a third party candidate siphons off votes from the Democratic nominee. He said he doesn't think that would be in the best interest of our county, and said, I would suggest to Mr. Schultz to truly think about the negative impact that that might make."}
{"original": "I have two words for Howard Schultz on a potential run for president as an independent: Just. Don't, said Washington State Democratic Party Chair Tina Podlodowski in a statement."}
{"original": "Podlodowski, the party chair in the state where Starbucks is headquartered and where Schultz once owned a professional sports team, also sent a fundraising email with the subject line Howard Schultz could secure Trump's re-election, and added one more jab in a subsequent statement following the CBS interview."}
{"original": "Howard Schultz running as an independent isn't about bringing people together, Podlodowski said. It's about one person: Howard Schultz."}
{"original": "On Monday, New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan also discouraged Schultz from launching a 2020 bid as an independent."}
{"original": "I am very, very concerned about the impact of a potential spoiler here, Hassan told CNN's Poppy Harlow on Newsroom. Mr. Schultz is a life-long Democrat. I would encourage him to get into the Democratic primary and test his ideas that way."}
{"original": "When asked if he is worried about siphoning votes away from Democrats, Schultz told CBS, I want to see the American people win. I want to see America win. I don't care if you're a Democrat, Independent, Libertarian, Republican. Bring me your ideas. And I will be an independent person who will embrace those ideas because I am not, in any way, in bed with a party."}
{"original": "Schultz said he sees extremes in both the Republican and Democratic political parties."}
{"original": "Every American deserves the right to have access to quality health care. But what the Democrats are proposing is something that is as false as the wall. And that is free health care for all, which the country cannot afford, Schultz said."}
{"original": "Schultz also said he 100% would release his tax returns. When Pelley pointed out Trump initially said the same but never did, Schultz said, We can do it today."}
{"original": "Schultz's new book, From the Ground Up: A Journey to Reimagine the Promise of America, which is out on Monday, details his difficult childhood being raised in public housing in Brooklyn, New York. He describes the physical abuse he endured and says he was haunted by the financial insecurity of his childhood."}
{"original": "Schultz describes his parents hosting illegal poker games in their apartment and says he would hide in his room or in the stairwell of the building. He writes, In me, injustice sparks a restlessness."}
{"original": "He describes his father as closed off and unapproachable – explaining his father's inability to find good-paying work to support their family drove him to build a different kind of company. Schultz said he was trying to build the kind of company that my father never got a chance to work for."}
{"original": "Schultz also details in the book his decades building Starbucks into the ubiquitous brand it is today and explains why, in 2011, he decided to speak out as CEO about controversial social issues including politics, race, and LGBTQ rights. He condemned the arrest of two black men at a Philadelphia Starbucks last spring and calls it a blow to our soul."}
{"original": "For the first time publicly, Schultz waded into the controversy he faced as the owner of the former NBA Seattle SuperSonics – a team he sold to an outside buyer, infuriating many Seattle residents. He owned the team from 2001 to 2006, and describes the move to sell the team to a group led by an out-of-state buyer as a tremendous mistake, admitting in the book, I had squandered the very public trust I had bought into."}
{"original": "In 2008, the franchise was moved to Oklahoma City, and its name changed to the Thunder."}
{"original": "Schultz writes it made him aware of the negative ramifications attached to power and writes I will forever be deeply sorry."}
{"original": "Schultz created a Twitter account on Sunday and his first tweet reads, It feels good to be here. My hope is to share my truth, listen to yours, build trust, and focus on things that can make us better."}
{"original": "Pelley said that after the CBS interview aired, Trump would likely tweet an attack on Schultz, to which Schultz responded: I think, like most people, I've become bored with President Trump and his tweets."}

{"original": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on French wine, Italian cheese, and single malt Irish whiskey last year -- and could escalate them by the end of the week."}
{"original": "That's worrying owners of specialty shops, restaurants and importers, some of whom have already raised prices on customers."}
{"original": "We're faced with a big dilemma. How much can we raise prices without losing our customer base, said Lou Di Palo, who runs the 110-year-old Di Palo's in Manhattan with his family."}
{"original": "Most of what they sell, including cheeses, meats and wine, is imported from Italy -- and that's not something Di Palo intends to change to avoid the cost of the tariff."}
{"original": "If we have to shift a large portion of our inventory to American-made cheeses, then we'd be just like every other supermarket. That's not what people travel to Di Palo's for, he said."}
{"original": "He gave fact checkers only a brief respite. Back to Washington and back to doing interviews and campaign rallies, Trump made 81 false claims last week. That is tied for the fifth-highest total in the 27 weeks we have counted at CNN."}
{"original": "It was an eclectic batch of dishonesty. Among other things, Trump took unearned credit for both the Ethiopia-Eritrea peace agreement and for the drop in the US cancer death rate, absurdly claimed that NATO had no money before his presidency, wrongly denied that his golf excursions cost taxpayers any money, and repeated his usual varied inaccuracies about impeachment, immigration and the nuclear agreement with Iran."}
{"original": "Trump made 27 of the false claims at his campaign rally in Toledo, Ohio. He made 16 more in a Fox News interview with Laura Ingraham. He made six in his speech on National Environmental Policy Act regulations, plus 10 in his exchange with reporters after the speech."}
{"original": "Trump's total of 81 false claims last week was above his average of about 61 per week. Trump is now up to 1,636 false claims since July 8, an average of about nine per day."}
{"original": "The most egregious false claim: Smearing Democrats"}
{"original": "Prominent Democrats had a consistent response to Trump's decision to kill Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani: criticize Trump's decision and say nothing nice about Soleimani."}
{"original": "Trump nonetheless claimed that they were saying nice things about the top Iranian general."}
{"original": "Appearing on Rush Limbaugh's radio show on January 6, Trump said, Democrats are trying to make him sound like he was this wonderful human being. Speaking to reporters after his January 9 speech on environmental regulation, he claimed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in particular was trying to defend this monster from Iran."}
{"original": "At a press conference the very same morning as Trump's regulation event, Pelosi had called Soleimani a terrible person who did bad things."}
{"original": "The most revealing false claim: Ethiopia and the Nobel Peace Prize"}
{"original": "Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize in large part for Ahmed's successful effort to make a peace deal with neighboring Eritrea."}
{"original": "Trump is an incorrigible acclaim-seeker who has been open about his desire for a Nobel. At his January 9 rally, he claimed that he was a more deserving recipient than Ahmed -- not for some other initiative of his own but because, he suggested, he was the one who actually made Ethiopia's big deal. I made a deal. I saved a country, and I just heard that the head of that country is now getting the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the country, he complained."}
{"original": "This left Ethiopians baffled . Experts on Ethiopia say there is no sign Trump played an important role in the deal."}
{"original": "The most absurd false claim: Trump and cancer"}
{"original": "The American Cancer Society issued a report saying that the cancer death rate had fallen in 2017 for the 26th consecutive year. Trump suggested his administration was somehow responsible for this 26th decline. U.S. Cancer Death Rate Lowest In Recorded History! A lot of good news coming out of this Administration, he tweeted"}
{"original": "This seemed clearly dishonest, but it wasn't clear that the American Cancer Society would be willing to say so: big organizations tend to want to avoid contradicting the President on even his most obvious falsehoods."}
{"original": "The Society's CEO, Gary M. Reedy, stepped up to the fact check plate -- diplomatically, but unequivocally. The mortality trends reflected in our current report, including the largest drop in overall cancer mortality ever recorded from 2016 to 2017, reflect prevention, early detection, and treatment advances that occurred in prior years, Reedy said in a statement to CNN."}
{"original": "Here is this week's full list of 81 false claims, starting with the ones we haven't previously included in one of the weekly roundups:"}
{"original": "He was a terrorist. You know, they don't want to call him a terrorist. Now the Democrats are trying to make him sound like he was this wonderful human being. -- January 6 interview with Rush Limbaugh"}
{"original": "What -- you know what I -- what bothers me? When I see a Nancy Pelosi trying to defend this monster from Iran, who has killed so many people, who has so badly -- I mean, so many people are walking around now without legs and without arms. Because he was the big roadside bomb guy. He was the one who would send them to Afghanistan. He would send him to Iraq. He was big. That was his favorite thing. He thought it was wonderful. He doesn't think it's wonderful anymore. When Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats want to defend him, I think that's a very bad thing for this country. I think that's a big losing argument, politically, too. -- January 9 exchange with reporters after speech on National Environmental Policy Act regulations"}
{"original": "Where have the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats gone when they have spent the last 3 days defending the life of Qassem Soleimani, one of the worst terrorists in history and the father of the roadside bomb? -- January 11 tweet"}
{"original": "Facts First: Pelosi and other prominent Democrats have not defended Soleimani or tried to portray him as wonderful. They have criticized Trump's decision to kill him, but they have offered no defense of his actions or personality."}
{"original": "Pelosi called the killing provocative and disproportionate and argued that it put American soldiers, diplomats and other citizens at risk. But she called Soleimani a terrible person who did bad things, explicitly emphasizing that her opposition to killing him was not based in any sympathy for him or for Iran."}
{"original": "You can read a longer fact-check here"}
{"original": "Talking about a January 2016 incident in which Navy sailors were detained by Iran after they strayed into Iranian territorial waters, Trump said, But you remember the 10 sailors that were 15 feet across that line, probably they weren't -- they don't even know if they were in Iranian waters, but they said they were slightly in Iranian waters, so they humiliated them. -- January 6 interview with Rush Limbaugh"}
{"original": "Facts First: It's not true that the sailors were a mere 15 feet into Iranian territorial waters when they were confronted, and there is no dispute about whether the sailors were indeed in Iranian waters. (Trump did not specify who they were when he said they don't even know if the sailors were in Iranian waters, but he is wrong regardless.)"}
{"original": "A US Navy investigation into the incident concluded that the sailors were 1.5 nautical miles from Iran's Farsi Island, clearly within Iranian waters. It was reasonable for Iran to investigate the unusual appearance of armed U.S. Naval vessels within territorial waters so close to its shores, the investigation concluded . (The investigation also faulted Iran for its handling of the incident, but its criticism of Iran was not at all about where the sailors were located.) An illustrated map released by the US Navy also makes clear that the sailors were not mere feet from that line when they were stopped by Iran. Iranian and US officials told media outlets at the time that Iran's territorial waters extend 12 nautical miles from the island, a standard distance"}
{"original": "They're making things up. This is the craziest thing anyone's ever seen, and the two articles that they put in, as you know, they're not crimes, they're not -- they're not even allowed to be put in. It's a disgrace. -- January 10 interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham"}
{"original": "Facts First: The two articles of impeachment against Trump, : The two articles of impeachment against Trump, abuse of power and obstruction of Congress , are indeed allowed. While the Constitution says presidents can be impeached for Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors, the high crimes and misdemeanors do not have to be criminal offenses. The Constitution leaves it up to Congress to determine what qualifies."}
{"original": "Question: Will you be okay if John Bolton testifies? He indicated yesterday that he would if he is subpoenaed. Trump: Well, that's going to be up to the lawyers. It will be up the Senate. And we'll see how they feel. He would know nothing about what we're talking about, because if you know, the Ukrainian government came out with a very strong statement -- no pressure, no anything. -- January 7 exchange with reporters at meeting with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis"}
{"original": "Facts First: Trump was vague, but it is obviously false that Bolton would know nothing about the dealings with Ukraine that led to Trump's impeachment. According to witness testimony in the House impeachment inquiry, Bolton, who served as Trump's national security adviser until September, was present in relevant meetings -- with Trump, with other administration officials and with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky -- and had additional relevant conversations with key players on Trump's Ukraine team."}
{"original": "Here is a list of just some of the exchanges Bolton could be able to testify about."}
{"original": "A quote from Rep. Devin Nunes"}
{"original": "Republican California Rep. Devin Nunes, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, appeared on Fox News and criticized the Intelligence Committee Inspector General Michael Atkinson. Trump claimed he was quoting Nunes when he tweeted on January 12, The Democrats know the ICIG is a major problem-didn't release his testimony. Looks so much like everything else we've seen, from the Russia Hoax, to the Ukraine Hoax that became the Impeachment Scam. Must get the ICIG answers by Friday because this is the guy who lit the fuse."}
{"original": "Facts First: Trump's rendition of the quote had Nunes using stronger language than Nunes actually did. Nunes did not say anything must happen by Friday; he said, Well, I think it's pertinent that the ICIG get these answers by Friday."}
{"original": "Trump's tweet also omitted multiple sentences that Nunes also uttered, but the omissions don't significantly change the meaning."}
{"original": "The timing of military aid to Ukraine"}
{"original": "Speaking of the military aid to Ukraine, Trump said, And, by the way, in terms of the money, it got there two or three weeks ahead of schedule -- long before it was supposed to be there. -- January 7 exchange with reporters at meeting with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis"}
{"original": "Facts First: This was wrong. The aid did not arrive weeks ahead of schedule. While Trump did lift his freeze on the aid on September 11, more than two weeks before a September 30 legal deadline, the delay caused by Trump's freeze meant that : This was wrong. The aid did not arrive weeks ahead of schedule. While Trump did lift his freeze on the aid on September 11, more than two weeks before a September 30 legal deadline, the delay caused by Trump's freeze meant that $35 million of the aid could not make it out the door in time to meet the deadline, according to impeachment testimony from Mark Sandy, deputy associate director for national security in the Office of Management and Budget. To deal with this problem, Congress had to pass an extension of the deadline. Had that provision not been included, then any unobligated funds as of September 30th would have expired, Sandy testified"}
{"original": "The Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan watchdog agency that works for Congress, concluded that the aid freeze broke a law, the Impoundment Control Act. (The office's report was released the week after Trump made this comment. You can read a full story here .)"}

ISIS is still a threat in the wars in : Trump can accurately boast about the elimination of 100% of ISIS' self-proclaimed caliphate in Syria, but it's not true that 100% of ISIS itself has been eliminated; the terrorist group existed before it seized territory and continues to exist after it lost that territory. ISIS is still a threat in the wars in Iraq Syria and Afghanistan ; ISIS affiliates continue to claim responsibility for attacks elsewhere ; and the US government continues to warn about ISIS' ability to inspire homegrown terrorists around the world."}
{"original": "The Nobel Peace Prize, Ethiopia and Eritrea"}
{"original": "I mean, I'm going to tell you about the Nobel Peace Prize. I'll tell you about that. I made a deal. I saved a country, and I just heard that the head of that country is now getting the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the country. I said, what -- did I have something to do with it? Yeah, but you know, that's the way it is. As long as we know, that's all that matters, OK? I saved a big war, saved a couple of them... -- January 9 campaign rally in Toledo, Ohio"}
{"original": "Facts First: Trump did not make the Ethiopia-Eritrea peace deal that led to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed : Trump did not make the Ethiopia-Eritrea peace deal that led to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019, experts on the region say. While American diplomats did play a role in laying the groundwork for the negotiations -- it is not clear how important they were -- experts said Trump was certainly not the central player."}
{"original": "In my view, the initiative is purely Ethiopian, said Awol Allo, an associate professor of law and Horn of Africa analyst at Keele University in England, and even if we assume that the Americans have played some role, it is not clear to me how that makes Trump an obvious candidate. Trump has never been to Ethiopia and has never said a word about the conflict between these two countries, at least in public. If there is anyone who could claim some credit for the deal between the two countries, it should be Middle Eastern powers, particularly the United Arab Emirates, which had a key mediating role"}
{"original": "Trump might perhaps have been referring to his effort to broker a deal between Ethiopia and Egypt in a dispute over a dam Ethiopia is building on the Blue Nile river, a tributary of the Nile. But that dispute had not been resolved at the time of his complaint about the Nobel, so Trump could not have accurately claimed here to have made any successful deal."}
{"original": "Allo, who said he was one of the people who nominated Ahmed for the prize, emphasized that even Ahmed did not save any country, though Ahmed did do some really amazing things. Both Eritrea and Ethiopia would have continued to exist with or without the deal, Allo said."}
{"original": "Speaking critically about NATO's history, Trump said, Well, they build an office building for $3 billion. They do lots of things that they shouldn't be doing, before I got here. -- January 10 interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham"}
{"original": "Facts First: NATO does have an expensive new headquarters building, but Trump was exaggerating its cost. NATO told CNN on Tuesday that the building was constructed for a sum under the approved budget of 1.178 billion euro, or about $1.311 billion at Tuesday exchange rates, less than half the amount Trump claimed."}
{"original": "So when I came in, as you know, NATO was virtually a dead organization. It had no money. Nobody was paying except us. Practically nobody was paying. -- January 10 interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham"}
{"original": "Facts First: NATO was very much alive before Trump took office in January 2017. And the US was not the only one paying, no matter how you measure."}
{"original": "NATO countries other than the US spent a total of $262 billion on defense in 2016, according to official NATO figures (which use 2015 prices and exchange rates). The US spent $651 billion itself that year, more than two-thirds of the total, but it's not true that the US was the only one paying if this is what Trump was referring to."}
{"original": "NATO also has its own direct budget to fund its operations. While the US was also the biggest contributor to this budget in 2016, covering about 22%, it was, clearly, not alone ; Germany covered about 15%, France about 11%, the United Kingdom about 10%, and so on. Countries' contributions were set based on their national income."}
{"original": "Probably it's the reason, number one reason I'm running: America lost 60,000 factories under the previous administration, 60,000. You wouldn't believe that's possible, but I know it's true, because I've said it 50 times and the fakers back there, they've never corrected me. No, it's true. No, it's true. If I were slightly off, if it were, if I was off by two factories, there'd be a headline: 'Donald Trump told a fib.' -- January 9 campaign rally in Toledo, Ohio"}
{"original": "Facts First: Here, Trump was wrong twice -- both with his claim about 60,000 factories being lost during President Barack Obama's administration and with his assertion that he had made the same claim 50 times before. In fact, he has repeatedly : Here, Trump was wrong twice -- both with his claim about 60,000 factories being lost during President Barack Obama's administration and with his assertion that he had made the same claim 50 times before. In fact, he has repeatedly said , correctly, that the US lost 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations."}
{"original": "There are different ways to measure the number of factories in the country. According to the Census Bureau's Statistics of US Businesses data series, the number of manufacturing establishments in the US fell by 61,076 between 2001, the beginning of the George W. Bush administration -- when there were 352,619 establishments -- and 2016, the last full year of the Obama administration, when there were 291,543 establishments . That's a reduction of about 17%."}
{"original": "But under Obama alone, from 2009 through 2016, the decline was much smaller: 308,934 establishments to 291,543 establishments, a difference of 17,391 or about 6%."}
{"original": "Right now, it takes over seven years, and oftentimes much longer -- and seven years is like record time -- to complete approvals for a simple highway, the simplest of them. -- January 9 speech on National Environmental Policy Act regulations"}
{"original": "Facts First: Trump was exaggerating when he said seven years is like record time. Mary Neumayr, chairwoman of the Trump administration's Council on Environmental Quality, said at the same event that it takes over seven years on average for federal agencies to complete the environmental impact statement process for highway projects. She added that many projects have taken a decade or more -- but over seven years is, again, an average, not record time."}
{"original": "...today, it can take more than 10 years just to get a permit to build a simple road -- just a very simple road. And usually, you're not even able to get the permit. It's unusual when you get it. -- January 9 speech on National Environmental Policy Act regulations"}
{"original": "Facts First: Trump did not specify what he meant by simple road, but he was inaccurate even if he was talking about highways. While it can indeed take more than 10 years for some highway projects to receive environmental approvals, it isn't true that usually, you're not even able to get the permit. Brad Karkkainen, a University of Minnesota law professor and expert on environmental and land use law, said in an email: Trump's statement that most of the time you can't get the permit is just flatly wrong, by a wide margin. Just a complete fabrication."}
{"original": "Karkkainen noted that the vast majority of proposed actions assessed by the federal government under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) sail through without having to go through an Environmental Impact Statement process, the most comprehensive form of environmental review. Precise numbers for road and highway projects are not available, but in 2014, the Obama administration's Council on Environmental Quality estimated that about 95% of all analyses under NEPA (not only for highway projects) were classified as Categorical Exclusions, meaning that the proposals did not require either the full Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or even the quicker process known as an Environmental Assessment (EA)."}
{"original": "You can't assume that every project that gets an EA is ultimately approved, but the vast majority are. And beyond that, most of the 250 or so (per year) that get full-scale EISs also go through, albeit sometimes with modifications to mitigate environmental harms and/or to quell political opposition, Karkkainen said."}
{"original": "Karkkainen said highway might well have a higher failure rate than other kinds of projects, given how complex and politically controversial they can be, but it's still not true that most are rejected."}

As of the day prior to this tweet, Trump was at 41.8% approval in FiveThirtyEight's : There is no apparent basis for Trump's claim to have a 53% overall approval rating. As of the day prior to this tweet, Trump was at 41.8% approval in FiveThirtyEight's aggregate of polls, with 53.5% disapproval. We could not find any recent poll that put him at 53%. The Trump campaign did not respond to our request to identify the supposed poll Trump was mentioning."}
{"original": "It is possible Trump was taking an actual poll result and adding 10 points to his approval rating because of what he called the Trump 'thing' -- what he claims is a phenomenon in which his supporters decline to tell pollsters that they support him. But even if there are some shy Trump supporters, this is just not how approval ratings work; you can't take the findings of a poll and give yourself a guessed number of additional approval points."}
{"original": "Mocking Obama for golfing in Hawaii -- where Obama was born and liked to vacation -- Trump said, I drive to play a round of golf at a course I own; it doesn't even cost them anything.

{"original": "Facts First: It's not true that Trump playing golf at his own courses does not cost taxpayers money."}
{"original": "As The Washington Post reported last week , the Secret Service has disclosed that it has spent $588,000 on golf carts alone since 2017 to protect and escort Trump during his outings."}
{"original": "The Post reported in November on separate Secret Service spending that appeared to be related to Trump's golfing: On April 2, 2017, for instance, Trump played golf at his club in suburban Virginia — a short drive from the White House. That day, the records show, the Secret Service made five payments to 'Trump National Golf Club' totaling $26,802, the records show. Between May 31, 2017, and June 5, 2017, Trump played golf twice at the Virginia course, according to news reports...The Secret Service reported paying $29,000 to the Trump golf club then. On May 7, Trump was staying at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. Secret Service records show $16,000 in spending at 'Trump National Golf Club' that day."}
{"original": "Trump's trips from the White House to his golf course in nearby Virginia do require only a drive. His golf outings in Florida and New Jersey, however, require helicopter and plane flights from Washington."}

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a money-in-politics watchdog, Clinton's campaign spent $563.4 million and Trump's campaign $325.5 million, which means the Clinton total is less than double what Trump spent."}
{"original": "Clinton had far more spending support from outside groups promoting her candidacy -- $230.1 million for her versus $72.1 million for outside groups promoting Trump, according to the Center for Responsive Politics -- than Trump did.

{"original": "We know this is a small thing, but Trump has made repeated false claims at rallies about CNN's cameras. (He usually claims that CNN's red light has vanished when he has attacked CNN, supposedly proving that CNN has stopped broadcasting live or stopped filming.

{"original": "Trump claimed twice that NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg just announced $530 billion in increased spending by non-US NATO members. In one of these cases, he claimed this supposed $530 billion was all because of me."}
{"original": "Facts First: Trump's math was wrong. Stoltenberg explained during a meeting with Trump on December 3 that non-US NATO members have added a total of $130 billion to their defense budgets since 2016. By 2024, Stoltenberg said, this number will increase to $400 billion."}

{"original": "Facts First: It's not true that Obama never pushed NATO members to increase their military spending. Obama and predecessor George W. Bush both did so, though their public language was less confrontational than Trump's has been."}
{"original": "Obama repeatedly urged NATO allies to spend more. If we've got a collective defense, it means that everybody's got to chip in, and I've had some concerns about a diminished level of defense spending among some of our partners in NATO, Obama said in 2014.

{"original": "Facts First: There is no basis for the claim that there has been fighting over the Turkey-Syria border for 1,000 years; modern-day Turkey and Syria were both part of the Ottoman Empire that was only dissolved after World War I, and the border between them is less than 100 years old."}
{"original": "The border he refers to -- the Turkish-Syria border -- was established in 1923 with the Treaty of Lausanne and the founding of the Republic of Turkey. The exception to this is the province of Hatay, which passed from Syrian to Turkish control following a referendum, said Lisel Hintz, assistant professor of international relations and European studies at Johns Hopkins, who called a previous version of Trump's claim -- in which Trump said there had been fighting for 2,000 years -- patently and irresponsibly false."}

Whistleblowers have no obligation to speak publicly."}

{"original": "The National Security Council's top Ukraine expert, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, testified to Congress that he tried to make edits to the document to include two things that were said on the call but not included in the document.

{"original": "Facts First: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky : Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did say there had been no pressure from Trump and made other statements to that effect, but he has not gone so far as to say Trump did nothing wrong."}
{"original": "In an interview published by Time magazine in early December, Zelensky did say, Look, I never talked to the President from the position of a quid pro quo. That's not my thing. But Zelensky continued: I don't want us to look like beggars. But you have to understand. We're at war. If you're our strategic partner, then you can't go blocking anything for us.

{"original": "Facts First: Trump was at least slightly exaggerating Green's comments. In May, Green said this: I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this President, he will get reelected.

{"original": "Facts First: Trump was mixing up two separate issues. While the Trump administration does have : Trump was mixing up two separate issues. While the Trump administration does have new agreements with all Guatemala and Honduras, those agreements are related to the handling of people who come to the US seeking asylum, not criminals the US is seeking to deport.

{"original": "Trump said on three occasions that Democrats support open borders."}
{"original": "Facts First: Even 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who have advocated the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen.

{"original": "They were always for the wall and then I wanted it and they went against it. -- January 6 interview with Rush Limbaugh"}
{"original": "Facts First: Democrats were not always for the wall. In 2013, many Democrats supported a comprehensive immigration reform bill that included 700 miles of border fencing. But that was fencing, not the giant wall Trump has proposed -- and many Democrats supported it only as part of a package that included provisions they wanted, most notably a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants."}
{"original": "For example, Mary Landrieu, then a Democratic senator for Louisiana, voted for the final bill that included the fencing.

Trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that 27 years is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason."}
{"original": "But phase one was -- is a phenomenal deal. Could be up to $50 billion in farm product. So that's something that -- the most they ever did was $16 billion.

{"original": "Facts First: Study after study , including a report in late November from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has shown that Americans are bearing the cost of the tariffs. And it is Americans who make the actual tariff payments."}
{"original": "Trump claimed three times that he had a 95% approval rating among Republicans. On two occasions, he said this was a record; on one of these two occasions, he said Ronald Reagan was in second place at 87%."}
{"original": "Facts First: Trump's approval rating among Republicans is very high, regularly in the 80s and sometimes creeping into the 90s, but it has not been 95% in any recent major poll we could find."}
{"original": "Trump was at 89% approval with Republicans in a NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll conducted January 7-12, 93% in a Quinnipiac University poll conducted January 8-12, 88% in an Ipsos/Reuters poll conducted January 6-7, 89% in a Gallup poll conducted December 2-15."}
{"original": "The Quinnipiac poll at which he was at 93% had an overall margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, and a larger margin of error for the smaller sub-sample of Republican voters, so that poll found that it's possible Trump's true number is indeed 95% -- but it's not accurate to make leaps from the numbers the polls actually found without explaining that this is what you are doing."}
{"original": "Regardless, Trump's approval rating is not a record, Reagan is not in second place, and Reagan's peak was higher than 87%. Gallup's website features data on approval rating by party for every president since Harry Truman; George W. Bush hit 99% in Gallup polling after the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001. His father, George H.W. Bush, hit 97% at the end of the Gulf War in 1991. Reagan, Richard Nixon, and Dwight Eisenhower all went higher than 90%."}
{"original": "Trump said twice that unemployment rate is the lowest in in over 51 years. On another occasion, he said, We have the best unemployment numbers we've ever had. So that's very important."}
{"original": "Facts First: The unemployment rates for some demographic groups are at their lowest levels ever, but the overall unemployment rate is not -- though it is indeed impressively low."}
{"original": "The overall rate was 3.5% in December -- the lowest since 1969, with the exception of the 3.5% rate in September, but well above the record 2.5% set in 1953."}
{"original": "Trump said that American steel companies are now making billions in investments, while before, They weren't investing 10 cents. The industry was dead. Now, it's vibrant. -- January 9 campaign rally in Toledo, Ohio"}
{"original": "Facts First: While some steel plants were closing, being idled or otherwise doing poorly before Trump took office and before Trump imposed his tariffs on steel imports, and while some companies were struggling, it's not true that the industry was dead or that not even 10 cents of investment was occurring."}
{"original": "A simple Google search brings up numerous 2015 announcements about planned investments in steel plants. For example, Steel Dynamics announced a $100 million expansion at a mill in Mississippi. Commercial Metals announced a $250 million investment to build a micro-mill in Oklahoma. Nucor and a partner announced a $75 million investment in improvements at a mill in Arkansas. Ferrous CAL announced a $53 million investment in a Michigan plant to make steel for automotive companies."}
{"original": "Bloomberg reported in an October 2018 fact check: In fact, U.S. steelmakers Nucor Corp. and Steel Dynamics Inc. were two of the healthiest commodity companies in the world before Trump took office. There is no doubt that the steel industry had declined from its heyday: the number of people working in iron and steel mills or in making steel products fell from more than 250,000 in 1990 to under 150,000 by 2016. Still, dead is a major exaggeration. In 2016, the US produced about as much raw steel as it did at various points in the 1980s."}

The accord does give China more time than the US before it kicks in; it came into effect for all participating countries in November 2016 . The accord simply allows each nation to set its own targets for reducing carbon emissions. China picked 2030 as the year by which it planned to meet its primary targets, while the US picked 2025."}
{"original": "One of China's targets was to hit peak emissions  around 2030 . Another target was to get 20% of its energy from sources other than fossil fuels by 2030. That did not mean the accord somehow wouldn't kick in for China until 2030; 2030 was its (self-selected, non-binding) deadline, not a start date . Since the accord came into effect, China has implemented significant new policies to curb its emissions. The Obama administration set a target of reducing US emissions by 26% - 28% below 2005 levels by 2025 . That, similarly, did not mean that the accord would have only kicked in for the US in 2025. (Trump has begun the process of formally withdrawing the US from the accord.)"}

{"original": "If saving more isn't enough and you're looking to increase your cash flow this year, here are three ways to boost your income."}
{"original": "Money mistakes can sneak up on you. You may not realize how much of an effect these mistakes can have on your finances until you've already lost a pile of money."}
{"original": "If you learn to spot those financial faux pas and correct them early on, you can save yourself thousands of dollars -- and a few sleepless nights."}
{"original": "1. Buying a house you can't afford"}
{"original": "Everyone knows what a great financial asset a home can be. However, buying a house is not like buying some shares of stock. It's a huge investment of money, time, and energy. And if you overextend yourself financially to buy that house, it may end up being a pretty lousy investment."}
{"original": "If buying a house plunges you deep into debt and forces you to turn to credit cards to catch up, you'll end up spending more on fees and interest than you can possibly make back from your investment."}
{"original": "Mortgage lenders typically recommend you limit yourself to a monthly mortgage payment that's no more than 28% of your pre-tax income. If you can't find a house for less than than, you're better off renting until your situation changes."}
{"original": "2. Not saving at least 10% of your income (and more is better)"}
{"original": "Setting aside a reasonable chunk of your income on a regular basis can reap huge rewards for you. First, buying investments that have decades to grow will get you an enormous return thanks to compound interest. Second, having a savings account with a few months' worth of expenses can spare you from having to rely on credit cards during emergencies, which means you'll save a fortune on interest and other debt-related charges. And third, having money saved up gives you more flexibility in your lifestyle choices. For example, if you want to pursue a career in a field that has great earning potential in the future but pays very little today, having some cushion in the bank will make it a lot safer and easier to go for the dream job."}
{"original": "A buy-and-hold investing strategy has a lot of advantages, not the least of which is that it requires far less time and effort on your part to maintain. However, that doesn't mean you can set up an automatic investing plan and then ignore it for the next 30 years."}
{"original": "At a minimum, review your investments once a year and decide whether or not you're happy with their performance. This annual checkup will allow you to rebalance your portfolio and replace investments that no longer suit your needs, whether they're underperforming or they don't fit within your changing strategy."}
{"original": "For example, if you're near retirement and still have 70% of your portfolio allocated to stocks, then a sudden market downturn could wipe out a big chunk of your savings right before you need them to live on."}
{"original": "Yes, it's possible to make a fortune if you time your investments perfectly by buying stocks at market lows and selling it at the highs. However, it's also possible to make a fortune by winning the lottery -- and I still wouldn't recommend lottery tickets as a sound investment."}
{"original": "Timing the market turns investing into gambling, pure and simple. Because no one can predict with certainty whether stocks will rise or fall, even professional investment managers get it wrong more often than they get it right."}
{"original": "To make matters worse, you'll have to pay commissions and possibly taxes each time you make a transaction -- and market timing typically requires lots of transactions. These expenses can severely erode your returns, even if you manage to time all your trades perfectly (which you won't)."}
{"original": "So unless you have a crystal ball that will tell you exactly what the market is about to do, stick with buying quality investments and hanging on to them for long periods of time."}
{"original": "5. Keeping all your money in savings"}
{"original": "If you just stick all your money in your savings account, your bank will love you -- but inflation will eat away at that money over time until you have nothing left. Because inflation averages about 3% over the long term, you need to make at least a 3% return on your money just to break even."}
{"original": "And it's safe to say that there is no savings account in existence that pays 3% interest. Keep just enough money in checking to cover your expenses and protect you from overdrafts, and only sweep enough into a savings account to cover emergencies (perhaps with an online-only bank, which will pay far more in interest). Then direct the rest toward retirement and/or brokerage account investments."}
{"original": "As a quick example, if you left $10,000 in a savings account paying 1% interest for 20 years, you'd end up with $12,202. If you left that same $10,000 in a tax-deferred retirement account that earned an average of 7% annually for 20 years, you'd have $38,697."}
{"original": "Where do you want to be in 10 years, financially speaking? How about 20 years? If you don't have a goal, you'll have a hard time coming up with a savings plan -- and that means your money will be flying out the door for expenses instead of quietly making you thousands of dollars in maturing investments."}
{"original": "But if you set reasonable financial goals, and have a plan to meet them, you can accomplish amazing things. Maybe you'd like to have enough saved up for a down payment on a house within five years, and you'd like to be a millionaire within 30."}

{"original": "Under the new federal tax law, the number of tax filers hit by the Alternative Minimum Tax will drop by 96%."}
{"original": "Only about 200,000 tax filers are expected to owe the AMT in 2018, dramatically fewer than the 5.25 million who likely would have under the old tax law, according to estimates from the Tax Policy Center."}
{"original": "The AMT is a parallel tax system that requires many filers to calculate their tax bill twice -- once under the rules of the regular income tax code and once under the rules of the AMT. Filers must pay whichever is higher."}
{"original": "The original intent of the AMT was to ensure that the wealthy few back in 1969 didn't take so many tax breaks that they ended up owing no federal income tax."}
{"original": "But today, those who've typically gotten snagged by the AMT include two-earner married couples with kids in high-tax states, and more generally, households making between $200,000 and $1 million."}
{"original": "So why the huge drop in those affected?"}
{"original": "The new tax law made three big changes that drastically reduce who ends up owing the AMT. But the changes expire after 2025, at which point the Tax Policy Center estimates 6 million filers will be subject to it once again."}
{"original": "The amount of income automatically exempt from the AMT calculation has been increased to $109,400 for joint filers, up from $84,500; and to $70,300 for individual filers, up from $54,300."}
{"original": "Related: New estate tax law gives an enormous gift to rich families"}
{"original": "Normally the very highest income households don't get to take advantage of the exemption levels, at least not in full. But the new law greatly expands how many of them can."}
{"original": "The tax overhaul increases the exemption phaseout level -- which is the income level above which you gradually lose your income exemption, until it disappears completely. The phaseout levels were raised to $1 million for joint filers, up from $160,900; and to $500,000 for individuals, up from $120,700."}
{"original": "So a lot of households making between $200,000 and $1 million will now get to take full advantage of the exemption levels, whereas before they could not."}
{"original": "3. Fewer tax breaks under the regular tax code"}
{"original": "The AMT is usually triggered for filers when they claim a lot of exemptions, credits and deductions that are aren't allowed under AMT rules."}
{"original": "But the new tax law eliminates a lot of those breaks, such as personal exemptions, and it has limited the value of others, such as the state and local tax deduction, said Joe Rosenberg, a senior research associate at The Tax Policy Center."}
{"original": "The estimated 200,000 filers who will remain in the AMT's crosshairs are likely to be very high-income households that claim large, less-than-typical tax breaks such as tax-exempt interest on private activity bonds, Rosenberg said."}
{"original": "Even though most filers who have been subject to the AMT in the past will not be subject to it again over the next eight years, the mere fact that it remains on the books means millions of filers will still need to calculate their tax liability twice."}
{"original": "So much for the oft-promised simplification that the new tax law would provide."}

{"original": "Michael Moore: 'We're going to have the best chance with Clark'"}
{"original": "Moore is the author of a book critical of President Bush titled, Dude, Where's my Country?"}
{"original": "(CNN) -- Filmmaker and author Michael Moore, one of America's most outspoken liberals, has announced his choice for the Democratic presidential nomination: retired Gen. Wesley Clark."}
{"original": "Clark has been accused of being a Republican in disguise. So what gets Moore excited about Clark? He discussed it with CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer."}
{"original": "BLITZER: I've got to tell you, Michael, I was pretty surprised. Why do you like Wesley Clark?"}
{"original": "MOORE: First of all, I like him as a human being. I think he's a very decent and honorable person. I trust him. He seems very down to earth. And I like where he comes from. And, most of all, I think, as The New York Times pointed out last week, he's actually slightly to the left of Dean."}
{"original": "And this is something I think a lot of people don't realize, especially probably a lot of young people. Women, African-Americans, labor people, should really take a close look at this guy, because I did and I really liked what I saw."}
{"original": "BLITZER: I read the article that you posted on your Web site. I got the sense, though, that, for practical political reasons, the main reason you like Wesley Clark is that you think he can beat George W. Bush more than the other Democratic candidates."}
{"original": "MOORE: Well, that is a very good reason. I think certainly you have the best chance with him."}
{"original": "As you know, and you've pointed out many times, Wolf, this election is going to really come down to 15 states and a few percentage points [in] those states. And you have to ask yourself, who has the best chance of winning these states, Florida, West Virginia, Arizona, Nevada, Ohio, Missouri? When you put it like that, I think he definitely has the best chance."}
{"original": "But it's not just a matter of strategy for me, because, honestly, I think, you know, other candidates could also beat Bush. I think Bush is beatable. That's my main position. And I'll support whoever the candidate is."}
{"original": "MOORE: But I think we're going to have the best chance with Clark."}
{"original": "But my reasons for supporting him are the things that he stands for. He's going to end this war. He's going to change the tax rate, so that families of four who make under $50,000 a year are not going to have to pay federal income tax. And the rich are going to have to pay an extra 5 percent."}
{"original": "BLITZER: I also noticed in the article that you wrote, you -- explaining why you like Wesley Clark so much, you said this, He is clearly not from Park Avenue. Well, we all know Howard Dean was born on Park Avenue. Was that a swipe at Howard Dean? What do you have against Howard Dean?"}
{"original": "It was more what I have against Park Avenue. It was not meant to be a swipe at Dean. Look, I think Dean's a good guy. What's really been decent about Wesley Clark is that he's not participated in this kind of mud-slinging that the other candidates have."}
{"original": "And I think I'd like to participate in that tone and not throw mud at Dean and not bring up things that I think -- look, you could say so many things about any of the candidates, how -- positions they've taken that I don't like or haven't liked in the past, how they've changed their minds, things they've been involved in."}
{"original": "When I hear Dean say that he won't cut a dime out of the Pentagon budget, that's inexcusable. But I also believe he's the kind of person you could possibly move along some day to a better position. So..."}
{"original": "BLITZER: I want you to clarify another thing you said that was intriguing to me in the piece. You said, I will work enthusiastically for any of the non-Lieberman eight who might get the nomination."}
{"original": "BLITZER: Now, what exactly does that mean?"}
{"original": "MOORE: Well, for a long time, I've been in the anyone-but-Lieberman camp. And I think a lot of people are in that same camp."}
{"original": "The point being is that the other candidates -- of course, now with Moseley Braun out, it's now the non-Lieberman seven -- all the Democrats running, you could say something good about all of them. They all have good position on many of the issues. We're very fortunate this year to have this crop of candidates."}
{"original": "I just happen to think Clark is the best among them, best on the issues, best for the working people of this country, best to end this war, and the best to communicate this message to where I come from, in middle America."}
{"original": "This is a gift that the Democratic Party has been given. We have a four-star general, top of his class at West Point, a Rhodes scholar. And he's going to go out there and tell middle America what we need to do in terms of cutting the Pentagon budget, of standing up for the rights of working people, affirmative action, nondiscrimination against gays and lesbians."}
{"original": "MOORE: Go down the whole list, he's extremely strong on these issues."}
{"original": "BLITZER: I assume if Lieberman for some reason were to get the nomination, you would support him, though, over Bush, is that right?"}
{"original": "MOORE: It would take a lot of medication, Wolf."}
{"original": "BLITZER: What do you have against Joe Lieberman?"}
{"original": "MOORE: Well, he's running in the wrong party. Lieberman is kind of like a liberal to moderate Republican. You know, he's Bush-light. And God bless him, but he just doesn't really belong in this party."}
{"original": "BLITZER: All right, Michael Moore explaining why he likes Wesley Clark so much. Thanks for joining us."}
{"original": "MOORE: Thank you for having me on."}
{"original": "BLITZER: You and Madonna now are in the same camp."}
{"original": "MOORE: Hey, just to hear those two names in the same sentence, you've made my day, Wolf."}
{"original": "BLITZER: Michael Moore and Madonna both support Wesley Clark."}
{"original": "(CNN) Gretchen Whitmer, Michigan's Democratic governor, focused on health care and American workers Tuesday night in delivering the party's response to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address. Read her remarks below:"}
{"original": "Good evening. I'm honored to be here and grateful you're tuning in."}
{"original": "I'm Gretchen Whitmer, the 49th governor of the great state of Michigan."}
{"original": "Tonight, I'm at my daughters' Sherry and Sydney's public school -- East Lansing High. We're here with family, parents, teachers, and most importantly, students."}
{"original": "I want to thank you all for coming. But tonight, I want to talk to those of you watching at home."}
{"original": "I'd need a lot more than ten minutes to respond to what the president just said. So instead of talking about what he is saying; I am going to highlight what Democrats are doing. After all, you can listen to what someone says, but to know the truth -- watch what they do."}
{"original": "Michiganders are no different from Americans everywhere."}
{"original": "We love our families and want a good life today and a better life tomorrow for our kids."}
{"original": "We work hard, and we expect our government to work hard for us as well."}
{"original": "We have grit and value loyalty. And we still root for the Detroit Lions."}
{"original": "We -- and all Americans -- might be weary of today's politics, but we must stay engaged. Our country, our democracy, our future demand it. We are capable of great things when we work together. We cannot forget that despite the dishonesty and division of the last few years, together -- we have boundless potential."}
{"original": "And young Americans are proving that every day."}
{"original": "That's what I want to focus on tonight."}
{"original": "Monte Scott is thirteen years old and lives in Muskegon Heights, Michigan."}
{"original": "Monte's street was covered in potholes. They were ankle-deep, and he got tired of waiting for them to get fixed. So he grabbed a shovel and a bucket of dirt and filled them in himself."}
{"original": "During my campaign, people told me to fix the damn roads -- because blown tires and broken windshields are downright dangerous. And car repairs take money from rent, child care, or groceries."}
{"original": "And we -- the Democrats -- are doing something about it."}
{"original": "In Illinois, Governor J.B. Pritzker passed a multi-billion dollar plan to rebuild their roads and bridges. Governor Phil Murphy is replacing lead pipes in New Jersey."}
{"original": "All across the country, Democratic leaders are rebuilding bridges, fixing roads, expanding broadband and cleaning up drinking water."}
{"original": "Everyone in this country benefits when we invest in infrastructure."}
{"original": "Congressional Democrats have presented proposals to keep us moving forward. But President Trump and Republicans in the Senate are blocking the path."}
{"original": "When it comes to infrastructure, Monte has tried to do more with a shovel and a pile of dirt than the Republicans in DC have -- with the Oval Office and the U.S. Senate."}
{"original": "Bullying people on Twitter doesn't fix bridges -- it burns them. Our energy should be used to solve problems."}
{"original": "And it's true for health care, too."}
{"original": "For me, for so many Americans, health care is personal. Not political."}
{"original": "When I was 30, I became a member of the 'sandwich generation.' That means I was sandwiched between two generations of my own family for whom I was the primary caregiver."}
{"original": "I was holding down a new job, caring for my newborn daughter as well as my mom at the end of her brain cancer battle. I was up all night with a baby and during the day, I had to fight my mom's insurance company when they wrongly denied her coverage for chemotherapy."}
{"original": "It was hard. It exposed the harsh realities of our workplaces, our health care system, and our child care system. And it changed me."}
{"original": "I lost patience for people who are just talk and no action."}
{"original": "So, as a state senator, I worked with a Republican governor and legislature to expand health care coverage to more than 680,000 Michiganders under the Affordable Care Act."}
{"original": "Today, Democrats from Maine to Montana are expanding coverage and lowering costs. In Kansas, Governor Laura Kelly's working across the aisle to bring Medicaid coverage to tens of thousands."}
{"original": "In New Mexico, Governor Michelle Lujan-Grisham enshrined ACA protections into state law."}
{"original": "Every Democrat running for president has a plan to expand health coverage for all Americans. Every one of them has supported the Affordable Care Act with coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. They may have different plans, but the goal is the same."}
{"original": "President Trump, sadly, has a different plan. He's asking the courts to rip those life-saving protections away."}
{"original": "It's pretty simple. Democrats are trying to make your health care better. Republicans in Washington are trying to take it away."}
{"original": "Think about kids like seventeen-year-old Blake Carroll from Idaho, who organized a fundraiser to pay for his mom's colon cancer treatment. Or nineteen-year-old Ebony Myers from Utah, who sells art to help pay for her own rare genetic disorder treatment."}
{"original": "No one should have to crowdsource their health care. Not in America."}
{"original": "But the reality is, not everyone in America has a job with health care and benefits. In fact, many have jobs that don't even pay enough to cover their monthly expenses."}
{"original": "It doesn't matter what the president says about the stock market. What matters is that millions of people struggle to get by or don't have enough money at the end of the month after paying for: transportation, student loans, or prescription drugs."}
{"original": "American workers are hurting. In my own state. Our neighbors in Wisconsin. And Ohio. And Pennsylvania. All over the country. Wages have stagnated, while CEO pay has skyrocketed."}
{"original": "So when the President says the economy is strong, my question is: strong for whom?"}
{"original": "Strong for the wealthy? Who are reaping the rewards from tax cuts they don't need?"}
{"original": "The American economy needs to be a different kind of strong."}
{"original": "Strong for the science teacher spending her own money to buy supplies for her classroom."}
{"original": "Strong for the single mom picking up extra hours so she can afford her daughter's soccer cleats."}
{"original": "Strong for the small business owner who has to make payroll at the end of the month."}
{"original": "Michigan invented the middle class. So, we know -- if the economy doesn't work for working people, it just doesn't work."}
{"original": "Who fights for hardworking Americans? Democrats do."}
{"original": "In the U.S. House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats passed a landmark bill on equal pay, another bill to give 30 million Americans a raise by increasing the minimum wage, and groundbreaking legislation to finally give Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices for America's seniors and families."}
{"original": "Those three bills, and more than 275 other bipartisan bills, are just gathering dust on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's desk."}
{"original": "Senator McConnell, America needs you to move those bills."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, Democrats across the country are getting things done."}
{"original": "Pennsylvania's Governor Tom Wolf is expanding the right to overtime pay. Michigan is too. Because if you're on the clock, you deserve to get paid."}
{"original": "Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak and North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper are working to give hardworking teachers a raise."}
{"original": "And speaking of the classroom, Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers unilaterally increased school funding by $65 million last year."}
{"original": "In Colorado, Governor Jared Polis has enacted free, all-day kindergarten."}
{"original": "And in 29 states, we've helped pass minimum wage hikes into law, which will lift people out of poverty and improve lives for families."}
{"original": "That's why I'm so inspired by young people."}
{"original": "They respond to mass shootings demanding policies that make schools safer."}
{"original": "They react to a world that's literally on fire with fire in their bellies. To push leaders to finally take action on climate change."}
{"original": "They take on a road filled with potholes with a shovel and some dirt."}
{"original": "It's what gives me great confidence in our future. And it's why sometimes, it feels like they're the adults in the room."}
{"original": "But it shouldn't have to be that way."}
{"original": "It's not their mess to clean up. It's ours."}
{"original": "The choices we make today create their reality tomorrow."}
{"original": "Young people, I'm talking to you and your parents and grandparents: Democrats want safe schools."}
{"original": "We want everyone to have a path to a good life, whether it's through a union apprenticeship, a community college, a four-year university -- without drowning in debt."}
{"original": "We want your water to be clean."}
{"original": "We want you to love who you love, and to live authentically, as your true selves."}
{"original": "We want women to have autonomy over their own bodies."}
{"original": "We want our country welcoming and everyone's vote counted."}
{"original": "2020 is a big year. It's the year my daughter Sherry will graduate from high school. It's also the year she'll cast her first ballot, along with millions of young Americans."}
{"original": "The two things are connected. Because walking across the graduation stage is as important as walking into the voting booth for the first time."}
{"original": "Her future -- all our kids' futures -- will be determined not just by their dreams but by our actions."}
{"original": "As we witness the impeachment process in Washington there are some things each of us -- no matter our party -- should demand. The truth matters. Facts matter. And no one should be above the law. It's not what those Senators say -- tomorrow, it's what they do that matters."}
{"original": "Remember. Listen to what people say -- but watch what they do. It's time for action."}
{"original": "Generations of Americans are counting on us. Let's not let them down."}
{"original": "CNN's town hall on the coronavirus, addressing facts, fears, and medical guidance, has now finished. Here's what was discussed:"}
{"original": "Vaccine trials: CNN medical analyst Dr. Celine Gounder, a clinical assistant professor of infectious diseases, said it is just the very beginning of a long process of research and studies."}
{"original": "Reinfection: Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said while there is no design study that has proven that you are 'protected' from getting reinfected, projecting what we know about viruses, I would say that there is a very good chance that you're protected."}
{"original": "Young people need to take pandemic seriously: We are getting more and more information that someone can transmit even when they are asymptomatic. So in order to protect oneself, society and particularly the vulnerable people, we've really got to adhere to the physical separation, said Fauci."}
{"original": "Increased contact tracing can help save lives: Mike Ryan, director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Program said that, it is possible to do contact tracing even under the most difficult circumstances, but it does require a real scale-up in public health capacity."}

{"original": "Police fired water cannon and tear gas at gilets jaunes or yellow vest protesters in central Paris, who have marched through the city for the ninth consecutive weekend."}
{"original": "A total of 59 people were questioned by authorities, on charges including unlawful weapons and participating in a group with the goal of committing violent crimes."}
{"original": "Violent clashes occurred on the Champs-Elysées, a epicenter of the protests which have brought repeated disruption to the city."}
{"original": "The total number of demonstrators has also risen from last weekend, the country's Interior Ministry said."}
{"original": "More than 32,000 people were taking part across France at 2 p.m. local time (8 a.m. ET) on Saturday, a rise of 6,000 compared to the same time seven days ago."}
{"original": "In Paris itself, 8,000 were marching, a fourfold increase on last weekend."}
{"original": "The protests began as a campaign against a gas tax hike, but have morphed into a broader rally against President Emmanuel Macron's government."}
{"original": "They caused many tourist sites and landmarks to be closed in anticipation of violent scenes."}
{"original": "PHOTO: LUDOVIC MARIN/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Gilets jaunes protesters march through Paris on Saturday."}
{"original": "Some of the demonstrations in the capital on Saturday took place near the Rue de Trevise in the city's 9th arrondissement, where hours earlier an explosion at a bakery killed two firefighters and a Spanish citizen."}
{"original": "In his New Year's address, Macron referred to the movement without naming it specifically."}
{"original": "He acknowledged anger against injustice but said hateful speech would not be tolerated, and called on people to respect each other."}
{"original": "Last month, he pledged to increase the minimum wage and scrap new pension taxes, in an effort to appease the protesters."}
{"original": "At least 10 deaths have been linked to the protests, with most taking place in traffic accidents related to blockades in November and December."}
{"original": "CNN's Katie Polglase, Saskya Vandoorne and Arnaud Siad contributed to this report."}
{"original": "While delivering remarks on tax cuts for American workers, President Trump discussed his negotiations with Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying that China previously had taken advantage of the US but recent talks were going well."}
{"original": "(CNN) Chief Justice John Roberts will swear in Joe Biden on January 20 as the next president of the United States. But that historic ritual on the West Front of the US Capitol will not free Roberts of Donald Trump."}
{"original": "The nation's 17th chief justice, who has tried to shield the Supreme Court from the politics of the day, seems destined to be entangled with the destructive 45th president for years to come."}
{"original": "Most immediate, there is some chance Roberts would have the unwelcome task of overseeing -- for the second time -- a Senate impeachment trial of Trump. This one based on the deadly insurrection Trump instigated at the Capitol on January 6."}
{"original": "Even if that Senate possibility does not materialize for Roberts because of timing or other factors, the chief justice and judicial colleagues could face a barrage of Trump litigation caused by his final actions in office and lingering cases dating to his 2016 campaign."}
{"original": "The President has asked White House lawyers about his power to pardon himself, CNN reported last week. The constitutionality of such action is untested and would likely end up in the courts. Trump has already expansively invoked his power to pardon and grant clemency, notably on criminals who have been loyal to him."}
{"original": "New York (CNN Business) Corporate America has finally put its money where its mouth is -- just in time for Democrats to take control of Washington."}

{"original": "It's not a hard call for them, says Tony Fratto, who served in the George W. Bush Treasury Department and now advises companies. This is meaningful. These companies are saying we are not going to be there for you because your actions crossed this particular line -- aid and comfort to an effort to overthrow an election."}

{"original": "President Trump promised last week that he would present his new tax reform plan on Wednesday."}
{"original": "Actually, it's more likely to be a preview of his plan."}
{"original": "(LATEST NEWS: Trump to propose 15% top business tax rate)"}
{"original": "In the wake of Trump's promise, the White House walked back expectations that a comprehensive plan would be ready. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has only said that more details of the plan will be revealed."}
{"original": "In any case, what the White House does put out tomorrow will offer some guideposts to where Trump will start negotiations with tax writers on the Hill, who have been busy for months working on their own tax reform proposals."}
{"original": "So here's what to look for."}
{"original": "1. Just how different will Trump's new guidelines be?"}
{"original": "The president already put out broad outlines for tax reform at least twice on the campaign trail. In them he called for much lower tax rates for businesses and individuals and tax simplification."}
{"original": "Trump also outlined how much he'd like to cut rates. In the most recent iteration he proposed reducing the number of tax brackets for individuals from seven to just three: 12%, 25% and 33%."}
{"original": "He also proposed lowering the top tax rate for all businesses -- both corporations and so-called pass-throughs -- to 15%."}
{"original": "Yesterday, White House sources suggested he may come out tomorrow and again call for a 15% corporate tax rate, although no mention was made of a rate cut for so-called pass-through businesses, which include everything from small businesses to big law firms and investment partnerships."}
{"original": "2. Will he call for real tax reform or just tax cuts?"}
{"original": "Tax cuts are easy. Comprehensive, permanent tax reform is hard, because it would restructure the tax code and involve tough political tradeoffs to pay for any tax cuts that might be proposed."}
{"original": "Given that nearly half the year is over and progress has been slow, getting comprehensive reform done in 2017 is virtually impossible."}
{"original": "So the question is will Trump simply propose tax cuts, with promises to do real reform later?"}
{"original": "And if he opts for tax cuts, how will he propose paying for them? What tradeoffs, if any, is he willing to make? Experts have already thrown cold water on assertions from Mnuchin that Trump's tax plan will be paid for by economic growth."}
{"original": "If Trump doesn't mind adding substantially to deficits, that will undercut efforts by Republican leaders in Congress to make the changes permanent because of complicated legislative rules."}
{"original": "The concern for deficit hawks, meanwhile, is that if tax cuts add a lot to the country's debt, that could end up hurting growth and making it that much harder to put the country on a sustainable fiscal path."}
{"original": "3. Will Trump kill chances for a border adjustment tax?"}
{"original": "House Republicans' tax reform proposal would be paid for in large part by a so-called border adjustment tax, which would fundamentally alter how imports and exports are taxed."}
{"original": "The idea has divided the business community. A large swath is vociferously opposed, arguing it will hurt American consumers."}
{"original": "And the president has hardly given the BAT much of an endorsement. He's suggested he'd prefer something different that would tax imports, and even mentioned something called a reciprocal tax without much explanation as what a reciprocal tax is or how it would work."}
{"original": "Policy observers will look to his outline on Wednesday to see if it includes a BAT at all -- and if so, how it would be structured differently than the BAT proposed by the House GOP."}
{"original": "4. Will he focus first on corporate tax cuts?"}
{"original": "Some have suggested that Trump and Congress do reform piecemeal, and focus on corporate tax reform first."}
{"original": "If that's what Trump proposes, expect big pushback from pass-through entities, which make up the majority of U.S. businesses. While they use many of the same tax breaks as corporations, they are taxed through the individual tax code, where the top rate is 39.6%."}
{"original": "Small businesses, which include a lot of pass-throughs, worry that Congress will reduce their tax breaks to pay for lower corporate tax rates, but won't lower the top rate for pass through owners and shareholders much, if at all."}
{"original": "5. What's in it for the middle class?"}
{"original": "Mnuchin has said repeatedly that a top priority of Trump's tax plan will be tax relief for the middle class."}
{"original": "On the campaign trail, Trump talked about big tax cuts for everyone, though distributional analyses of his proposals showed the top 1% would benefit the most by far."}
{"original": "It will also be interesting to see whether Trump's new outline will call for tax breaks to help families with child care costs. Late in the campaign he proposed two, but an independent analysis found that such breaks -- coupled with a few other of Trump's tax proposals -- could unintentionally raise taxes on millions of low- to middle-income families."}
{"original": "For the second time this week, Israeli police have announced a new corruption investigation targeting members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's inner circle, marking the fifth such investigation to entangle the premier and those closest to him."}
{"original": "Netanyahu slammed the latest investigation, in which a member of his inner circle has been arrested, while denying any involvement in the case. It comes less than a week after police said they had enough evidence to indict Netanyahu on charges of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust in two corruption cases and hours after members of his inner circle were arrested."}
{"original": "On Tuesday morning, police revealed details of the fifth investigation, saying that two people had been arrested on suspicion of corruption."}
{"original": "PHOTO: JACK GUEZ/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Crowds in Tel Aviv protest against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu."}
{"original": "In late 2015, the suspects approached Judge Hila Gerstel, offering to make her attorney general in exchange for inquiring about her position regarding investigations of Sara Netanyahu, the wife of the Israeli Prime Minister. No agreement ever materialized. Gerstel approached Supreme Court Justice Esther Hayut, explaining what had happened, but Hayut, in a statement, said she never passed on the information because Gerstel left out key details."}
{"original": "Details of the latest case come from Hayut's statement as well as a police statement."}
{"original": "Although police didn't identify the suspects, Netanyahu named one of the two as Nir Hefetz, his former family spokesperson."}
{"original": "In a response to reports about the investigation, Netanyahu said, Nir Hefetz never suggested this absurd idea to the Prime Minister and his wife, [and] he never asked them to put forward an idea like this, and we don't believe that Hefetz even had such an idea."}
{"original": "A lawyer for Hefetz denied all the allegations against him."}
{"original": "Hefetz was arrested in a separate case revealed one day earlier, known locally as Case 4000, on suspicion of bribery and obstruction of justice. That case marked the fourth to entangle the Prime Minister or members of his inner circle. Less than 24 hours later, police announced a fifth."}
{"original": "Proclaiming his innocence, Netanyahu said in a statement, Soon they will blame the Netanyahus for the murder of Arlosoroff, referring to the assassination of Zionist leader Haim Arlosoroff."}
{"original": "In court documents, Hefetz's lawyer denied any wrongdoing in the previous case."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, Israeli police chief Roni Alsheich hit back at Netanyahu on Tuesday in a veiled jab at the Israeli leader, saying, During criminal proceedings, [suspects] try to create doubt as to the credibility of the police officer's testimony and his professionalism."}
{"original": "Alsheich, speaking about public trust at the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations on Tuesday, said, The world of professional criminals has always had an interest in damaging the public trust by promoting and maintaining a negative image of the police."}
{"original": "PHOTO: Spencer Platt/Getty Images North America/Getty Images Benjamin Netanyahu arrives with his wife Sara for the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York in September 2017."}
{"original": "In recent weeks, Alsheich has come under attack from Netanyahu, who has accused the investigation of harboring conspiracy theories driven by media pressure. In a Facebook post earlier his month, he said police investigators believe ludicrous thoughts, and that they can no longer work in an objective manner."}
{"original": "The attacks have increased following a police statement last week that they have enough evidence to indict Netanyahu on corruption charges in two separate investigations. Netanyahu has said a shadow has fallen under the police investigation, and insisted the police cases have holes like Swiss cheese."}
{"original": "Alsheich appeared to take issue with Netanyahu's increasing attacks coming on social media. In the age of internet, the opportunities are endless. The ability to transmit information is infinite. Every action which can be presented as a mistake by police officers becomes the potential for a media campaign against the police, Alsheich said."}
{"original": "Defending the work of police investigators, Alsheich added, We don't want to be on the left side, on the right side. We want to be on the side of the law."}
{"original": "Netanyahu still has the support of key coalition partners, who have said they will wait for the Attorney General to make a decision about whether or not to indict the Prime Minister, which could take months. One key partner, Education Minister Naftali Bennett, did say that Netanyahu was not acting up to the standards of his office."}
{"original": "Israeli opposition MK Yair Lapid, head of the Yesh Atid party and one of Netanyahu's chief rivals, called on Netanyahu to step aside."}
{"original": "Speaking at the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations on Monday, Lapid said, He needs to step aside until this is resolved, he doesn't even need to resign, they can put in someone else from Likud as has been done before. It's an incredibly difficult job, maybe the second hardest in the world, and we need a Prime Minister who is focused on this. In a democracy, the way to change the government is in the polls but I don't think he can give the country the attention it needs."}
{"original": "Everyone understands there is a problem running the country because the PM is so pre-occupied with his own problems, Lapid added."}
{"original": "Lapid, a witness in one of the cases against Netanyahu, served as Finance Minister when investigators said Netanyahu tried to advance a bill that would have provided tax benefits to a friend."}
{"original": "Former Vice President Joe Biden responded to questions from Fortune and Time's Up via email. The following transcript of that exchange has been edited for length and clarity."}
{"original": "Fortune/Time's Up: Do you believe that the United States should have comprehensive paid family and medical leave, and if so, what is your proposal to make it happen?"}
{"original": "Biden: Absolutely. When I lost my first wife and baby daughter in a car accident, I became a single parent to my two young sons. I've taken care of aging parents. I know how hard it is to raise a family, and what it's like to take care of a sick family member. American workers deserve to know they can keep their families afloat if they have to take care of a sick family member."}
{"original": "It's time for our federal government to get its priorities straight, so that workers can care for the people they love when they need it most. I was proud to fight for the Family and Medical Leave Act, landmark legislation that created important workplace protections and granted 12 weeks of [unpaid] leave to working families. But we need to go further—I believe the United States should guarantee 12 weeks of paid sick and family leave for workers."}
{"original": "I support the coverage and protections in Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand's (D-N.Y.) FAMILY Act, which recognizes that workers need paid time off to care for newborns or newly adopted children, to take care of themselves or family members with serious health conditions, or to care for military family members and help them prepare for deployments. And it won't just help some workers. Part-time workers, independent contractors, workers who change jobs, and workers at small employers will be able to take the time they need, too. Instead of instituting a payroll tax on employers and employees like the FAMILY Act does, I will pay for this proposal by returning the estate tax to 2009 levels."}
{"original": "One of the highlights of my career as a public servant has been standing with survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault; they shouldn't be left behind here either. As President, I will guarantee paid leave for survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking who need time to seek physical or mental care, seek counsel, find new housing, or take other action related to the violence they experienced."}
{"original": "How will you ensure that families who need it have access to safe, affordable childcare?"}
{"original": "Ensuring that every family has access to safe, affordable childcare is one of the best things we can do for working parents. Everywhere I go, I meet people who say they can't afford childcare. When I'm President, parents will get up to $8,000 in tax credits to offset the cost of childcare. All 3- and 4-year-olds will be able to attend high-quality, universal prekindergarten at no cost, and after-school programs and community centers will have additional funding to serve kids when school isn't in session."}
{"original": "Do you think institutions—from Congress to Fortune 500 companies—have done enough to address sexual harassment? What have you done, and what will you do, to prevent and address sexual harassment in the workplace?"}
{"original": "Women need to feel safe no matter what. No matter where they are—at home, at school, at work, and in their communities. I have spent my entire career fighting for women's safety, starting in 1990, when I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. At the time, domestic violence was considered a private family matter. Because of that landmark legislation, and countless survivors who have spoken out, that is no longer the case today. Women who face violence at home or on campus know that they are not alone—that they have a way forward."}
{"original": "I'm proud of what our nation has done to reduce sexual violence, and as President, I'll double down on those efforts to make sure that women are safe at work. First, I'll push Congress to pass the BE HEARD Act. This bill takes a comprehensive approach to workplace harassment. It holds all employers accountable. It funds research so we better understand how to stop harassment in the workplace from the get-go. And, it closes loopholes so that all workers—not just some—are protected."}
{"original": "Second, I'll protect domestic workers from harassment and discrimination by passing the National Domestic Workers Bill of Rights, so that these workers, many of whom are women or people of color, are not left behind, and instead are treated with dignity and respect."}
{"original": "Third, I'll end mandatory arbitration clauses imposed by employers on workers so that workers who experience harassment can have their day in court. No one should be forced to sign a nondisclosure agreement that silences them and prevents them from speaking out about harassment or discrimination."}
{"original": "Women in the U.S. earn 80 cents on white men's dollar in wages, a gap that gets even wider for black women, Latinas, and Native American women. What is your plan to work with employers to close the pay and opportunity gap for women, including women of color, LGBTQ women and working mothers?"}
{"original": "It is unacceptable that there are employers paying women less than men for the same work. As President, I will finish the Obama-Biden administration's work on ending unequal pay. The very first bill the Obama-Biden administration signed was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which made it easier for women to fight back if they were unfairly paid less than their male coworkers. We also protected more workers against retaliation for discussing wages and required employers to collect and report wage gaps to the federal government. As President, I will build on this critical work by signing into law the Paycheck Fairness Act."}
{"original": "And, recognizing that women make up the majority of minimum-wage workers, I'll stop the exploitation of low-wage workers. I'll increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour, support the elimination of the tipped minimum wage, and dismantle the barriers to higher-paying jobs for these workers."}
{"original": "I believe the United States should be leading on [pay equity disclosures and enforcing penalties for unequal pay]. Improving transparency is one essential step to ending the pay gap between men and women. The Obama-Biden administration expanded requirements for employers to report pay information to improve the federal government's ability to take enforcement action against employers who are discriminating and change the culture around pay transparency."}
{"original": "As President, I'll make it easier for workers to join together in class action lawsuits, shift the burden to employers to prove pay gaps exist for job-related reasons, and increase penalties against companies that discriminate, as called for in the Paycheck Fairness Act. And I'll hold companies accountable by increasing funding for investigators and enforcement actions."}
{"original": "Do you support policies that require corporations to have women and other underrepresented groups on corporate boards? Why or why not?"}
{"original": "Make no mistake: Discrimination and bias hold back families, companies, and our economy. It is in everyone's best interest for our workforce to look like the rest of the country, from the stockroom to the boardroom."}
{"original": "The lack of women at these higher levels is partially a pipeline problem. As President, I would push for policies that would make it easier for women to pursue management and leadership roles—by expanding access to affordable childcare, guaranteeing workers 12 weeks of paid family leave, supporting flexible work schedules, and—importantly—putting an end to harassment and discrimination."}
{"original": "But corporations need to take a hard look at their corporate culture and practices, which is why my administration will push for transparency and also promote best practices for companies to address bias and discrimination."}
{"original": "Would you—and how would you—propose to strengthen protection for people who need accommodations to do their jobs while pregnant or who are discriminated against because of their pregnancies at work?"}
{"original": "When businesses refuse to give workers these small accommodations, pregnant women are forced to choose between work and their health. This is all too common in American workplaces, especially in industries where jobs are inflexible and physically demanding—and more likely to be held by low-income women, women of color, or immigrant women. That's why I support the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which requires employers to provide reasonable workplace accommodations when their employees' abilities are limited by pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition."}

{"original": "There are now five Republicans who have come out publicly for impeachment. There may be a few more in the hours ahead. That's not many.

{"original": "McConnell has not spoken to Trump since December, when he acknowledged that Biden had won the election, and the Kentucky Republican has no intention to talk to him again. McConnell's silence over impeachment is purposeful, sending a signal to his conference that is being heard loud and wide that if they want to vote to convict Trump when a trial unfolds in their chamber, they are free to do so. Long gone are the days when McConnell was trying to keep his conference together as they weathered the impeachment trial in 2020. There will be no conversations to try and keep more moderate Republican senators such as Lisa Murkowski of Alaska or Mitt Romney of Utah or anyone else from voting however they want."}
{"original": "McConnell had been slowly distancing the GOP conference from Trump for weeks. First by recognizing Biden won. Then by making it clear he wasn't going to renegotiate a stimulus proposal the President's own staff had helped draft. In his final days, McConnell led the first veto override of Trump's Presidency and now, McConnell is going to sit back and let his members do whatever they want to Trump's future."}
{"original": "McConnell has tried -- as he often does -- to give his members room. Some members like Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina have rebuffed impeachment. Others, like Sens. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, have said they'll take a look."}

It's still in Republicans' best interest politically to slow Biden's agenda. But, as CNN reported Tuesday, McConnell is telling people that impeachment could make it easier to rid the GOP of Trump. McConnell is having conversations with Biden over the rules that would govern a trial. McConnell isn't closing the door on his own vote, and he is signaling -- very strongly -- that if a member wants to vote to remove Trump from office, it sure would make it easier for the party to rid itself of Trump's legacy forever."}
{"original": "Another reminder: The Senate can vote to convict Trump by a two-thirds majority. That requires 17 Republican senators. That's a lot of members. That's a lot of Republicans. But let's give it time. If the Senate votes to convict, it then can vote to never let Trump hold office again. Keep that in the back of your head. There is not only a way to symbolically move on, there is a way for the Republican Party to literally rid Trump from ever being atop their ticket again."}
{"original": "A quick note about next week"}
{"original": "Despite the unexpected move to impeach Trump for the second time, four confirmation hearings are already scheduled for Tuesday, a sign that Republicans and Democrats are finding some consensus to move forward despite the inflamed political environment right now. Reminder, these committees are still chaired by Republicans until Wednesday, meaning Republicans had to notice these hearings. Four Senate Committees -- Foreign Relations, Armed Services, Finance and Homeland Security -- have announced they will hold confirmation hearings for Secretary of State nominee Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary nominee Lloyd Austin, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas."}
{"original": "The Biden team is also having conversations with key committees and leadership about his first legislative priority, ensuring they can pass another stimulus bill. CNN has been told by one source familiar with those talks that Biden is eying legislation that will include $2,000 checks, an extension of federal unemployment benefits, more money for vaccine distribution as well as state and local funding that was dropped from the last package. The plan, according to the source, is for Democrats to try and introduce the bill without using reconciliation first. If Republicans object, aides tell CNN, they could use the arcane reconciliation process to try and pass the stimulus with a simple majority vote. While there is still likely to be plenty of time between now and then, Biden's team isn't letting impeachment stop them from beginning their legislative work."}
{"original": "We'll soon learn how the Republican health care bill that passed the House last week will impact the number of uninsured and the deficit."}
{"original": "The Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday that it will release an updated estimate of the American Health Care Act early in the week of May 22. The legislation was changed several times after it was introduced, and House lawmakers took the unusual step of voting on it without a fresh CBO score."}
{"original": "The Senate is eagerly awaiting the revised report as it works to repeal and replace Obamacare. The chamber is expected to make major changes to the House bill, but needs the CBO score to know how much it will cost."}
{"original": "The most recent agency review of the House bill found that it would reduce federal deficits by $150 billion between 2017 and 2026. (An earlier CBO score found that the legislation would reduce deficits by $337 billion, but lawmakers then changed several tax and Medicaid provisions that eliminated some of the savings.)"}
{"original": "Related: Who gets hurt and who gets helped if Obamacare gets repealed"}
{"original": "However, the most damning finding of the CBO report was that 24 million more people would be uninsured in 2026 under the GOP bill than under Obamacare. An estimated 52 million people under age 65 would be uninsured, compared with 28 million if Obamacare remained in place."}
{"original": "Since the last CBO report, House Republicans made several changes, including adding more money to the bill to help states and insurers cover high-cost patients and giving states the option to weaken some of the provisions protecting those with pre-existing conditions."}

{"original": "Stefan Passantino, the former White House deputy counsel who was responsible for overseeing compliance with ethics and conflict-of-interest rules, will handle its responses to Democratic investigations, Passantino informed Congress in a letter sent to the House Oversight Committee on Friday and obtained by CNN."}
{"original": "Passantino left the White House last year to join Michael Best & Friedrich, a Milwaukee-based firm headed by former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus."}
{"original": "Passantino will work closely with the Trump Organization's chief general counsel Alan Garten and chief compliance counsel George Sorial, according to sources familiar with the arrangement."}
{"original": "Passantino plans to recuse himself from issues he worked on while in the White House, according to one of the sources."}
{"original": "Passantino registered his representation as part of the Trump Organization's response to a December request for information concerning foreign payments to the company from House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings. Friday was the deadline."}
{"original": "The Trump Organization has responded to requests from various members of Congress in the past, according to Passantino's letter. But Democrats, who now hold subpoena power, have said the responses so far have not been sufficient."}
{"original": "Democrats have made it a priority to investigate whether foreign governments are currying favor with the administration by doing business with the President's family company in violation of the constitutional ban on such payments to the president, known as emoluments."}
{"original": "Unlike his predecessors, Trump has declined to release his tax records or fully divest himself from his businesses, which are currently overseen by a trust and run by his eldest two sons, Don Jr. and Eric Trump."}
{"original": "The emoluments issue is also being pursued by the District of Columbia and Maryland, which have sued in federal court over the President's interest in the Trump International Hotel. The Justice Department has moved to stop the case from proceeding."}
{"original": "In his letter, Passantino reiterated many of the same points Trump Organization has made in prior congressional correspondence, including the idea that payments from foreign governments don't qualify as emoluments because they are fees for services provided."}
{"original": "After receiving Passantino's letter, Cummings said it was largely a rehash of arguments and information previously provided."}
{"original": "We will follow up as appropriate with the Trump Organization to seek the information that we need, Cummings said in a statement to CNN."}
{"original": "While serving in the administration, Passantino was tasked with overseeing the White House ethics program, which included certifying financial disclosures for White House staff. In addition to recusing from matters he handled in that role, he will not be communicating with the executive branch, the source added."}
{"original": "In November, CNN reported that Trump Organization executives were preparing for the investigations, including sending a reminder to staff to preserve records, according to a person familiar with the conversations. They also discussed bringing on additional outside counsel, that person said, particularly a firm with expertise in government investigations."}

Shanghai was second with 55.3%, while London – which came top in CBRE's 2017 report – came third with 51.7%. New York, the top US city, ranked eighth with 46.3%."}
{"original": "The report by the commercial real estate services and investment company analyzed the retail sector in 123 major cities in 47 countries, using a sample of 334 global retailers.

{"original": "BERMAN: Yes. CAMEROTA: I feel, this week."}
{"original": "BERMAN: All right. The last ten minutes have gone quickly."}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: Well, that is also true."}
{"original": "OK. Up first, we have this new report to tell you about. It reveals an extreme idea that the White House was considering to deal with undocumented immigrants at the border."}
{"original": "CNN has learned that President Trump personally pushed his ousted homeland security secretary to release undocumented migrants onto the streets of so-called sanctuary cities in order to target his political foes. A source tells CNN that Kirstjen Nielsen resisted that plan."}
{"original": "CNN has also learned that top Trump adviser Stephen Miller had a big hand in pushing that plan. The Washington Post, which first reported this story, found that this idea came up more than once in six months."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, CNN's Dana Bash gets an exclusive interview with Vice President Mike Pence about the situation at the border and much more."}
{"original": "BERMAN: He makes a pledge on family separations, which will be interesting to hear what he says on that."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, we're officially in the window where we could see the redacted Mueller report. It could be today, and it would make for a heck of a Friday news dump."}
{"original": "All of it can now be viewed through the new filter of the attorney general's stunning comments. He said he believes the Trump campaign was spied on by U.S. intelligence, though he didn't exactly tell us what he meant or provide evidence. President Trump, though, is rejoicing in that statement."}
{"original": "And this morning we're hearing from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who oversaw the Mueller probe. How does he explain William Barr's words and choices?"}
{"original": "Let's begin our coverage, though, with CNN's Boris Sanchez, live at the White House, Boris, with what appears to be an effort to use law enforcement, not to mention human beings as a form of political retribution."}
{"original": "BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, good morning, John."}
{"original": "For years, President Trump has railed against the country's immigration laws. But now, according to new reporting, it appears that the White House at least explored the possibility of using those immigration laws to punish the president's political enemies."}
{"original": "SANCHEZ (voice-over): President Trump is no fan of sanctuary cities."}
{"original": "TRUMP: My administration is launching a nationwide crackdown on sanctuary cities."}
{"original": "SANCHEZ: And that's exactly where he wanted to send migrants detained at the southern border. A source tells CNN the White House pressured homeland security officials to release detained migrants into so- called sanctuary cities that limit cooperation with federal law enforcement to protect most immigrants from deportation."}
{"original": "The president himself pushed former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to follow through on his plan, according to a source. Why? In part to retaliate against Democrats who opposed his border wall."}
{"original": "But Nielsen resisted, and the DHS legal team eventually produced analysis that killed the plan. The Washington Post reports House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's district in San Francisco was among those targeted. Pelosi firing back saying, quote, Using human beings, including little children, as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, President Trump embracing controversial comments from his attorney general, William Barr."}
{"original": "WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: I think spying did occur, yes. I think spying did occur."}
{"original": "TRUMP: I think what he said was absolutely true. There was absolutely spying into my campaign. I'll go a step further. In my opinion, it was illegal spying, unprecedented spying."}
{"original": "SANCHEZ: A counter-intelligence investigation into a Trump campaign staffer was launched legally through a warrant approved by a foreign intelligence surveillance court."}
{"original": "Now, as Washington braces for Barr to release his redacted version of the Mueller report, outgoing Deputy Rod Rosenstein is defending Barr's four-page summary of the nearly 400-page report."}
{"original": "Rosenstein telling The Wall Street Journal, quote, He's being as forthcoming as he can, and so this notion that he's trying to mislead people, I think is just completely bizarre."}
{"original": "SANCHEZ: According to reporting in the New York Times and The Washington Post, this sanctuary cities idea was first brought up last November around the time of the midterm elections in an email from a White House policy adviser to DHS attorneys. It was brought up again in February for ultimately being abandoned, John."}
{"original": "Boris Sanchez for us at the White House. Yes, brought up at least to times."}
{"original": "Want to bring in CNN senior political analyst John Avlon."}
{"original": "And John, I want to read the lead from The Washington Post. Rachael Bade, one of the reporters, will be with us a little bit later, which is great to hear from her."}
{"original": "CNN has matched the story, but The Post broke it. White House officials have tried to pressure U.S. immigration authorities to release detainees onto the streets of sanctuary cities to retaliate against President Trump's political adversaries, according to Department of Homeland Security officials and e-mail messages reviewed by The Washington Post."}
{"original": "A, that's a heck of a lead. B, retaliate against political adversaries with human beings."}
{"original": "AVLON: That is the fact of what is being being reported. It is completely insane. Do not accept this as the new normal or just another day in the Trump administration."}
{"original": "This is the latest and, in some ways, the most sinister bit of evidence that this president and his administration do not respect the rule of law. And they are being contained by professionals in agencies who try to tell them that their plans to release detainees on the streets of sanctuary cities, small and mid-sized, by the way, to punish their political enemies cannot be done."}
{"original": "[06:05:11] And for that, they come under intense political pressure. This is deeply, deeply troubling if this is the instinct of the president and his political advisers to try to pull off kind of a domestic Mariel boatlift, to disrupt and undercut his perceived political opponents in America's cities and towns."}
{"original": "BERMAN: You said they are being contained by other officials there. How does it color the view of what they tried to do, the fact that it didn't happen?"}
{"original": "AVLON: I think that is the cold comfort we can take is that we're living through a civic stress test. But the president's worst impulses, his most autocratic and, you know, vengeful impulses. And those of his senior aides on some of these issues are being contained by administration officials, some of whom are Trump appointees, some of whom are simply people who've dedicated their life to serving the people of the United States."}
{"original": "But the system is straining. And we've already seen a degree of retaliation or attempted retaliation against some of these people, particularly in the Office of Legal Counsel."}
{"original": "So that is what's troubling. The good news is the system is holding, and the president's worst impulses are being contained, but it is being strained every day by the occupant of the Oval Office."}
{"original": "BERMAN: I will note that people are clearly leaking to The Post, to The Times, and to us about this about this, posting email messages about this. None have been sent by Stephen Miller, according to The Post, but his name is associated with this. He is thought to be behind some of these notions. And now, more powerful than ever on the issue of immigration."}
{"original": "AVLON: He has been empowered by the president. He is trying to systematically purge, apparently, policy opponents inside the organization. Again, that word purge. Not one noticeably used in American politics for administrations' on staffers, but that's the degree of the ideological divide."}
{"original": "That's the degree of the impulse to say, Break the law on my behalf to punish my political enemies. These are not sentences we say very often in American history. It's happening right now on our watch."}
{"original": "BERMAN: All right, John. We're going to talk much more about this coming up. Thank you very much."}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: And meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence getting a first- hand look at the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border. CNN's Dana Bash spoke exclusively with the vice president about the Trump administration's plan for families at the border and much more."}
{"original": "DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: CPB says that family unit apprehensions have increased nearly 375 percent. The spike is incredible. Can you explain how the administration that ran on making sure that this didn't happen let things get to this point?"}
{"original": "PENCE: Well, first, I think the president and I appreciate the fact that people around the country and even many people in the media are now beginning to recognize that we have a genuine crisis at our southern border."}
{"original": "I heard about it again today here in Nogales. On Tuesday, 4,300 people came across our border illegally along the Southern border in its entirety. The vast majority of those people were families and unaccompanied minors, begin driven by human traffickers and drug cartels that are exploiting these vulnerable families, and they're exploiting loopholes in our laws."}
{"original": "BASH: We have information that the president has been talking about reinstating the zero tolerance policy. Can you vow, standing here at the border, that family separation will never be reinstated?"}
{"original": "PENCE: The president made it very clear this week we're not rethinking bringing back family separation. But it's absolutely essential to end a humanitarian crisis that really threatens the security of the American people and is creating hardship on both sides of our border. Congress needs to act."}
{"original": "BASH: The president tweeted last night the following: I think what the Democrats are doing with the border is TREASONOUS, all caps. Their open-border mindset is putting our country at risk. We'll not let that happen."}
{"original": "I know you generally say that the president has his own style of talking, but to to use the word treason, which is supposed to be punished by death, how do you get from that rhetoric to the kind of working across the aisle that you're talking about that's needed to fix things here?"}
{"original": "PENCE: I think what you hear the president expressing is the frustration of the American people. That last month alone, more than 100,000 people came across our southern border illegally."}
{"original": "BASH: I just have to ask you about the mayor of South Bend, Pete Buttigieg. He said, I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand that, if you've got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator."}
{"original": "What he's saying is he didn't choose to be gay. His creator did. What's your response to that?"}
{"original": "PENCE: You know, I've known Mayor Pete for many years. We worked very closely together when I was governor. And I considered him a friend."}
{"original": "And he knows I don't have a problem with him. I -- I don't believe in discrimination against anybody. I treat everybody the way that I want to be treated."}
{"original": "[06:10:13] BASH: Do you agree with him that God made him gay?"}
{"original": "PENCE: Well, look, the truth of the matter is that all of us have our own religious convictions. Pete has his convictions. I have mine."}
{"original": "BASH: Right. Well, he argues that your quarrel is with him as a gay man and that he says, I was born with way, and this is the way God made me. That's just not your belief?"}
{"original": "PENCE: Well, I think -- I think Pete's quarrel is with the First Amendment."}
{"original": "PENCE: All of us in this country have the -- the right to our religious beliefs. I'm a Bible believing Christian."}
{"original": "BASH: Julian Assange. I want to ask you about something that Mike Pompeo, when he was the CIA director, said. He called WikiLeaks a non-state house (ph) intelligence service, often abetted by state actors like Russia. Do you agree with that characterization?"}
{"original": "PENCE: Yes, we strongly agree with that. That's why the Justice Department is now seeking extradition. And we're going to bring Julian Assange to justice."}
{"original": "Look, we're working with Chelsea Manning. Julian Assange was involved in one of the greatest compromises of classified information in American history. It literally put American military personnel at risk, and we'll hold him to account in the American justice system."}
{"original": "BASH: What about what he did in 2016? The president, when he was a candidate, welcomed seeing WikiLeaks and the information that they got from Hillary Clinton. Has that changed?"}
{"original": "PENCE: Well, I think the president always, as you in the media do, always welcomes information. That was in no way an endorsement."}
{"original": "BASH: Even though (UNINTELLIGIBLE) said that?"}
{"original": "PENCE: An organization that we now understand was involved in disseminating classified information by the United States of America."}
{"original": "BERMAN: All right. A lot more to discuss about Dana's exclusive interview with the vice president at the border coming up."}
{"original": "This morning, as you heard in that interview, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is behind bars in Britain, facing extradition to the United States for allegedly conspiring to hack into government computers to steal U.S. military secrets."}
{"original": "WikiLeaks played a key role also, as you heard right there, in the release of DNC and Clinton campaign e-mails in 2016. Back then, President Trump said, I love WikiLeaks. Now he says he knows nothing about WikiLeaks."}
{"original": "CNN's Nick Paton Walsh live in London with the very latest -- Nick."}
{"original": "NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: John, behind me, I think, in the Ecuadorian embassy, they're probably breathing a sigh of relief, maybe even cleaning up after their lengthy unwelcome house guest, even reports from Ecuadoran officials of feces on the walls at some point, damage to the building's infrastructure."}
{"original": "But what ahead now for Julian Assange, always a man not to be afraid of the spotlight? Ell, certainly, he has to face a sentencing hearing here in London in probably the next weeks ahead because of the bail he skipped out on here when he hid inside the embassy back in 2012."}
{"original": "And then on May the 2nd, most likely after he's sentenced, he'll have an extradition hearing. That is to face this indictment in the United States, which specifies that he worked with Chelsea Manning to try and crack part of a password that would have enabled Chelsea Manning to masquerade as an administrator in a U.S. computer system during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, classified information here, so she could have downloaded that. Well, he at the time, Bradley Manning, could have downloaded that and then released it through WikiLeaks."}
{"original": "But Donald Trump here, President Trump very clear, and we often see this, on how he's very much more ignorant about WikiLeaks than he was simply a matter of years ago. Here's what he said."}
{"original": "This WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable. It tells you the inner heart. You've got to read it. It's been amazing what's coming out on WikiLeaks."}
{"original": "This WikiLeaks is like a treasure trove."}
{"original": "I know nothing about WikiLeaks. It's not my thing. I know nothing really about them. It's not my deal in life."}
{"original": "WALSH: Now, it is the British court system, though, that will decide whether or not Julian Assange goes to the United States. That process could take months. Frankly, it may even be that whatever sentence he has to serve here in the U.K. for violating that bail is, in fact, expended while he's waiting to learn his extradition fate."}
{"original": "And then it's possible in the United States he will face further charges. Now, there will be intense political debate here. His pretty substantial defense team already using the open court system to make a very clear case that he's a journalist who published information who's being persecuted. The indictment says he conspired to commit a criminal act. It will be up to U.K. judges to decide his fate -- Alisyn."}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: OK, Nick Paton Walsh, thank you very much for all of that reporting."}
{"original": "Let's bring in CNN legal analyst Carrie Cordero. She is the former counsel to U.S. assistant attorney general."}
{"original": "Carrie, great to see you. So yesterday, as John and I were watching this arrest unfold on our air, I kept wondering why that day, why yesterday, after seven years, you know, of him being holed up in that embassy?"}
{"original": "[06:15:06] And I think that we've gotten the answer, which is there was this ticking statute of limitations. I was surprised to hear there is an eight-year statute of limitations for at least one of his charges. And so it sounds like -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- is that why they had to move with alacrity?"}
{"original": "CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: I think it certainly was a factor. And I think it's important to keep in mind that this case against him and the investigations involving him and the process of extradition, this would have been work that was done behind the scenes by law enforcement and prosecutors and diplomats from the U.S., the U.K. and Ecuador, which was housing him for some time."}
{"original": "And so I think it was a confluence, perhaps, where you had the statute of limitations. The legal process had been under seal. The indictment had been under seal in the Eastern District of Virginia for some time. And then we needed the other factor -- U.S. Law enforcement needed the other factor in play, which was the government of Ecuador finally making the decision to release him to U.K. authorities. CAMEROTA: Yes, and it sounds like their patience really ran out with him. I mean, certainly, we hear Nick Paton Walsh's reporting about the conditions that he was living in."}
{"original": "Let me read to you the indictment, because I think that it's interesting what we found out that he's being accused of. On or about March 8, 2010, Assange agreed to assist Chelsea Manning in cracking a password stored on United States Department of Defense computers connected to the Secret Internet Protocol Network, a United States government network, used for classified documents and communications."}
{"original": "So that is different, right? That's different than just publishing classified documents. That is taking an active role in getting them."}
{"original": "CORDERO: Exactly right, Alisyn. So the passage that you just put up, that's really the crux of this particular indictment and charge against him."}
{"original": "Julian Assange is not being charged with publishing classified information. I'll say it again. He's not being charged with publishing classified information. What he's being charged with is being an active participant in a conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse."}
{"original": "In other words, he did a specific thing to try to assist Chelsea Manning to crack a password to get unauthorized access into Department of Defense procedures. And so what the Justice Department is going to argue is that is not traditional journalist behavior."}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: Indeed. Carrie Cordero, thank you very much for all of the legal expertise -- John."}
{"original": "BERMAN: Just saying, I prefer posters as wall hangings. Just letting that out there."}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: That's good. That is more traditional."}
{"original": "BERMAN: Posters more traditional, to be sure."}
{"original": "What a swirl of controversy surrounding attorney Michael Avenatti this morning. He is fighting back against a new string of new charges. The former lawyer for Stormy Daniels was indicted on 36 counts, including embezzlement prosecutors claim was part of a scheme to steal tens of millions of dollars from his clients."}
{"original": "Our Sara Sidner live in Los Angeles with the details here. And this is a big, big list of indictments."}
{"original": "SARA SIDNER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It is. Thirty-six counts, including embezzlement, wire fraud, tax fraud, bank fraud, bankruptcy fraud here. The U.S. attorney for the Central District of California coming out very strongly, condemning the things that he's accused Michael Avenatti of. And one of the things in this case that was stunning to a lot of"}
{"original": "people as they listened to it were the five people that the prosecutors say Michael defrauded. Five of them were clients of his, they say, who were defrauded of millions of dollars, including a paraplegic client, a client who had won a $4 million settlement that prosecutors say Michael Avenatti took, put into a trust account, as you are supposed to do for your clients, but then drained that trust account of more than $3.5 million, only giving the client somewhere around $125,000, telling him that the full settlement hadn't come in when he had already spent the money."}
{"original": "Here's a little bit more of what prosecutors had to say."}
{"original": "NICK HANNA, U.S. ATTORNEY: As it turns out, within months after receiving the settlement proceeds in early 2015, Mr. Avenatti had drained the entire $4 million payment from his trust account, using significant portions of the funds to finance his coffee business, his auto racing enterprise and his own personal lifestyle."}
{"original": "SIDNER: Now, Michael has shot back, saying that he's not guilty of any of the charges against him, and he claims that any moneys owed due to his clients are bogus."}
{"original": "But we should mention that, with all of these charges -- and that's just in this case here in California -- that he faces up to 335 -- 335 years in prison. And that does not include the case that the SDNY has against him, which involves Nike, where they have said that he tried to extort Nike."}
{"original": "[06:20:05] CAMEROTA: My gosh. Sara Sidner, thank you for explaining all of that and laying it out for us."}
{"original": "All right. He is not officially in the race yet. But Pete Buttigieg is surging in some new polls. We discuss those next."}
{"original": "BERMAN: All right. New this morning, major movement in the Democratic race for president. Truly from nowhere in the polls, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg appears to be breaking out in two early voting states. Look at these numbers from Iowa and New Hampshire. Pete Buttigieg has launched himself into third place behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, and ahead of some pretty big names."}
{"original": "Joining us now to discuss, Howard Dean, former presidential candidate, governor of Vermont; Laura Barron-Lopez, national political reporter for Politico; and Joe Lockhart. He is the former White House press secretary for President Clinton and hosts the Words Matter podcast."}
{"original": "Governor Dean, I want to start with you. And I know it's early. So let's stipulate --"}
{"original": "HOWARD DEAN, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's early."}
{"original": "But Pete Buttigieg was the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, at zero or minus in the polls to months ago. And now he's ahead of people who have been in the Senate. He's ahead of people who live next door to New Hampshire. There is clearly something happening with this South Bend mayor."}
{"original": "DEAN: Our core base is young people, people of color and women. And Pete Buttigieg is incredibly attractive to young people."}
{"original": "[06:25:05] I was supporting him for the Democratic National Committee chairmanship, because that's our core base. And he has gotten his message out there, partly on CNN town meetings and things like that. People like him a lot. I'm shocked at the number of people who come up to me and say, What do you think of this guy?"}
{"original": "And I demur, because I have to stay neutral, because I'm running the data project. And they say, Well, I sent him some money."}
{"original": "You did? These are people my age. So this is real. He's basically, I think, assured him, as barring some scandal or something, that he's going to be in the first cut."}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: So Joe, strategically, what has Mayor Pete Buttigieg done better than other people? Why has he leapfrogged?"}
{"original": "JOE LOCKHART, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I agree that it's early. And I think that you've seen several of these candidates get a little bit of a bump around the time of their announcement. It's always the anticipation. Kamala Harris did, certainly. And then settled back down."}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: And is that what you think is happening here?"}
{"original": "LOCKHART: I actually think it's a little bit more. I think -- I agree with Governor Dean that he touches constituencies he is, in some ways, touches all of the elements."}
{"original": "If you look at Iowa and New Hampshire, the votes he's taking from are from Beto supporters but more than anyone, Bernie Sanders supporters, which was surprising when I looked at the numbers yesterday."}
{"original": "And I think what that's about is people tend to look at, like, Sanders as Democrats want an ultra-progressive, a Democratic socialist. I don't think that's it at all. I think the Democratic constituency's much more in the middle."}
{"original": "I think it's -- I think it's people rebelling against incremental politics, the politics that I think Hillary talked about. We've got to go slow, we've got to make change."}
{"original": "And what Buttigieg is doing here is tapping into this idea that we can think big, Obama-like; we can change the system. We don't have to do it incrementally. And he's doing it in a language that young people understand, and they feel an affinity."}
{"original": "So I think the bottom line is I don't know who's going to win. But he's now in, you know, the first tier or 1-B tier and will have to be taken seriously."}
{"original": "BERMAN: And he's getting some help, maybe, we could put it, from Mike Pence, the vice president of the United States?"}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: Well, he's getting some help from picking a fight with Mike Pence, I would say."}
{"original": "BERMAN: You know, it's interesting. Because Buttigieg's entry into exploring the race did not, you know, circle around Mike Pence. It was not talking about his own sexuality that much. It really wasn't. It was I'm a Midwest governor. I know how to win in a Trump state. That was his main focus."}
{"original": "But day by day, Laura, he does talk more about the fact that he's married, which is something that Mike Pence opposed in his state. And I want to play for you what Pete Buttigieg just told Ellen DeGeneres on a clip that's going to air today."}
{"original": "BUTTIGIEG: I'm not interested in feuding with the vice president. But if he wanted to clear this out, he could come out today and say he's changed his mind, that it shouldn't be legal to discriminate against anybody in this country for who they are. That's all."}
{"original": "ELLEN DEGENERES, TALK SHOW HOST: Yes."}
{"original": "BERMAN: It's interesting. You heard in the interview with Dana Bash, Laura, that the vice president would not say he believes that people are born gay."}
{"original": "LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, POLITICO: Right. I think that even though Pete Buttigieg hasn't made this debate with Pence a central part of his campaign, it definitely helps him. I mean, any time that a Democratic candidate can be seen at odds with either the president or with the vice president, it boosts them. And that could be, also, part of why he's surging in the polls."}
{"original": "And again, I think that Buttigieg is really getting attention because of how young he is, because of his policy ideas, as we mentioned earlier."}
{"original": "But it's so early that in a month, we could see this drastically change. We could see Warren or Harris be third. And I think that if anyone -- if we pretend to know what is going to happen nine months out, we'll be shocked when -- when the first contest happens."}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: That's for sure. Understood. Today is just a snapshot of where we are today. It's nothing more. It's not predictive."}
{"original": "However, given that, Governor, where is Beto O'Rourke? After all the excitement and the splash of the Vanity Fair cover, why isn't he in those two states in the top?"}
{"original": "DEAN: Well, he's doing pretty well. But you know, this is a hard, long process. There's two ways of doing this."}
{"original": "One is to raise a lot of money, and the other is to be on the ground and set up a great network. He's not going to have any trouble setting up a network, and he's raised a lot of money. The problem is the expectations for -- for Beto were much higher than they were for Pete Buttigieg."}
{"original": "But Beto raised $83 million for a Senate race in Texas. Buttigieg, nobody ever heard of. But he's got momentum., and you guys are giving that momentum. I got that ride up, and of course, I got the ride down once I was the frontrunner."}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: It's a round trip ride we give you."}
{"original": "DEAN: Let me say something quickly. Joe is absolutely right, and nobody is talking about this in the media. This party is not moving to the left. All you guys are focusing on, Ocasio and Rashida Tlaib and so forth and so on."}
{"original": "In one sense, Ames, Iowa, has something any other city might envy: An unemployment rate of 1.5%, the lowest in America."}
{"original": "Buoyed by Iowa State University's main campus, this metropolitan area with about 100,000 people just 40 miles north of Des Moines has long had a tighter-than-average labor market, meaning that almost everyone who wants a job can find one. But there's a downside to having that many jobs: Businesses looking to expand or relocate have a tough time finding employees."}
{"original": "If a company was doing a site search, and were basing it strictly on the unemployment rate, we would be out every time, said Dan Culhane, president of Ames' Chamber of Commerce. They're still able to find the workforce, Culhane explains, but it usually requires luring someone with the promise of higher pay or recruiting from out of town."}
{"original": "Ames' mixed blessing is an extreme version of what the U.S. may face should unemployment sink further past its current 16-year low of 4.1%: An undersupply of workers readily available for the work that needs doing. Economists at Goldman Sachs expect the rate to get as low as 3.3% by 2019, even if wages rise enough to draw people who had given up looking for jobs following the Great Recession back into the workforce."}
{"original": "That wouldn't be as much of a problem, of course, if unemployment were uniform across the country. There are still pockets with much higher unemployment rates, particularly in cities in California and New Jersey, where the housing bust hit hard."}
{"original": "So why don't people just relocate from those cities to places like Ames?"}
{"original": "Related: How the federal tax overhaul could reshape state budgets"}
{"original": "One big reason unemployment is low in the upper Midwest: It's hard to get people to move there."}
{"original": "The very tightest job markets are overwhelmingly concentrated in a small part of the country. Out of the 20 metro areas with the lowest unemployment rates in November 2017, 14 are in Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, and Wisconsin."}
{"original": "Those regions have seen a run of good economic luck. Most of them didn't overheat during the housing bubble, and thus didn't fall too hard during the crash. As the recession wore on, agricultural areas were bolstered by high prices for corn and soybeans. These economies relied on some manufacturing, but few whole towns depended on it or suffered terribly as factories disappeared, like those in Michigan and Ohio. The upper Midwest has also largely managed to escape the opioid epidemic that has swept through the rest of rural America."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, North Dakota's oil-rich Bakken shale formation drew people from its neighboring states during the fracking boom, and many of them stayed even when oil prices declined and the frenzy faded — leaving fewer workers to go around overall."}
{"original": "However, not all the jobs in the upper Midwest pay as well as working on an oil rig. Of the 1,700 jobs openings on the WorkInAmes.com job site, many are hourly positions in hospitality, transportation, or retail, paying between $10 and $20 an hour."}
{"original": "That can be a good thing. Such jobs don't require as much education, which helps keep unemployment low because the skills of the local labor force fit the work available — unlike in very high-skilled markets like Washington D.C., which have large populations that lack the education necessary to compete for the specialized jobs that exist there."}
{"original": "But those middle-skilled jobs don't usually pay enough to convince someone to move from, say, Merced, California or Ocean City, New Jersey. In fact, plenty of cities with low unemployment also have high poverty rates, since the jobs that are available still don't pay enough to live comfortably."}
{"original": "Outside North Dakota, the Upper Midwest has seen relatively slow growth, in part because it also hasn't drawn the immigrant population that settled in border states and big coastal cities."}
{"original": "The Bakken was an interesting anomaly, because wages were so high, it literally just sucked people in, said Ron Wirtz, outreach director at the Minneapolis Federal Reserve. Everywhere else, you have normal labor market migration. And if you're not from the upper Midwest, it's probably a higher hurdle to move there, because of the weather."}
{"original": "Related: My road back from the Great Recession"}
{"original": "Even if the upper Midwest did attract people from other areas, newcomers might not have as easy a time finding jobs."}
{"original": "The populations of places with super-low unemployment tend to be very white. People of color are no less willing to work there, said Alan Berube, deputy director at the Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Program. There are just fewer of them in the applicant pool to discriminate against. In more diverse places, white hiring managers are more likely to discriminate against people of color, which can keep a large chunk of the population on the sidelines."}
{"original": "In the homogenous upper Midwest, you're just not going to have a lot of labor market discrimination, because the people doing the hiring are going to look like the people applying, Berube said. It's not just Minnesota nice. It's sameness. I think sameness can work to alleviate labor market friction that other parts of the country are going to exhibit."}
{"original": "Under those circumstances, cities in Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota and Wisconsin are doing their best to lure the people most willing to give the middle of the country a try: People who already have a connection to it."}
{"original": "Related: The great debate: Will tax cuts trickle up or down?"}
{"original": "Mankato, a southern Minnesota community with the nation's second-lowest unemployment rate, just launched a web site, MoreMankato.com, with 360-degree views of the city. They're preparing a social media advertising campaign targeting alumni from nearby universities, and helping local employers recruit from within the region."}
{"original": "We are looking at areas of significant unemployment and letting them know that we do have job vacancies available, said John Considine, director of regional business intelligence at Greater Mankato Growth, the town's economic development organization. We have to help people understand that we're not a frozen tundra wasteland."}
{"original": "Ames is doing that, too. But in convincing the city's student population to stick around, Culhane said he could use a little help from Washington in the form of immigration reform, which would allow those who came from overseas for their studies to work in the U.S. after they graduate."}
{"original": "We've got a lot of really bright people who are from around the globe who are educated here, and we want them to stay, Culhane said. We need them to stay."}

You do not believe in those things."}
{"original": "JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't believe in the way they're doing that. For example, I think there should be health care for everyone. I have a plan how to do that that's rational and will cost a hell of a lot less and will work. In terms of --"}

{"original": "CUOMO: Would bring back the individual mandate?"}
{"original": "CUOMO: Would you bring back the individual mandate?"}
{"original": "BIDEN: Yes, yes, I'd bring back the individual mandate."}
{"original": "CUOMO: You think that will be popular?"}
{"original": "BIDEN: Well, it's not -- yes, now it would be, compared to what's being offered."}
{"original": "And here's the deal, Chris. We're in a situation where, if you provide an option for anybody who, in fact, wants to buy into Medicare for all, they can buy in. They buy in. And they can do it."}
{"original": "But if they like their employer-based insurance, which a lot of unions broke their neck to get, a lot of people like, they shouldn't have to give it up."}
{"original": "The flip of that is, if you don't go my way and you go their way, you have to give up all that. And what's going to happen when you have 300 million people landing on a health care plan? How long is that going to take? What's it going to do? And in the meantime, a lot of people are going to be in trouble."}
{"original": "In terms of the economy, Chris, I've been proposing for a long time, and I've -- look, I know I'm Middle-Class Joe, I get that past. It's not meant I'm sophisticated. It meant I'm, you know -- middle class built there country. You didn't have Wall Street build this country. How did they do it? You gave people a chance. You allowed them to maintain their dignity."}
{"original": "And how'd they do it? How can you have dignity without having health care? How can you have dignity without having access to an education? How can you have dignity unless you live in a neighborhood that's not fouled by the environment and what's going on?"}
{"original": "CUOMO: How do you convince the party that these more advanced ideas, all in on Medicare for all, that matter to them --"}
{"original": "BIDEN: I wouldn't call them advanced. I would call them --"}
{"original": "CUOMO: But they're popular in the party."}
{"original": "BIDEN: Well, by the way, watch. That's what this election is about. I really -- I'm happy to debate that issue and all those issues with my friends."}
{"original": "Because guess what? Again, look who won the races. Look who won last time out. We had -- and by the way, I think -- I think Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a brilliant, bright woman. But she won a primary."}
{"original": "In the general election fights, who won? Mainstream Democrats who are very progressive on social issues and very strong on education, health care."}
{"original": "Look, my north star is the middle class. When the middle class does well, everybody does well."}
{"original": "CUOMO: How do you do better for them economically? If not with these 70 percent tax rates?"}
{"original": "BIDEN: Well, three things. One, I do raise the tax rate to 39.5 percent. I do, in fact, eliminate the ability for them to write off capital gains the way they do now. I would raise the -- and raise billions of dollars, raise the corporate tax rate from 20 to 28 percent -- it was 36 -- to 28 percent. I'd raise billions of dollars."}
{"original": "CUOMO: Trump will say, but that's what brought the economy up to the were it is, is those tax cuts."}
{"original": "BIDEN: Ask these people who work in this restaurant how the economy came up for them. Ask how good they feel about it, how the stock market is working. Ask how driving the $2 trillion greater in debt has done anything for them."}
{"original": "CUOMO: On health care, do you believe that undocumented people should have health care in this country?"}
{"original": "BIDEN: I think undocumented people need to have a means by which they can be covered when they're sick. And so the idea is that's what I think we should be doing by building more clinics around the country. Not just for undocumented, for other people when they're ill, when they're sick. People need -- this is just common decency. You're not -- this is common decency. You're not going to let somebody --"}
{"original": "BIDEN: Well, I know it it."}
{"original": "CUOMO: Well over 50 percent of people polled say undocumented people shouldn't have health care on our dime."}
{"original": "[07:05:08] BIDEN: Well, I mean, I'll tell you something. In an emergency, they should have health care. Everybody should. Anybody here in the country."}

{"original": "You know, I mean, the idea that, you know, I hear the stuff about how, you know, they're killing Social Security, et cetera. Those who have jobs, guess what? They've increased the life span of Social Security by close to a dozen years. I mean, we got this -- this is part of what Trump is playing on. He's playing --"}
{"original": "CUOMO: It works for him, this issue, the issue of law and order versus a left that seems like it's open borders, because it means it's lawless. You have people who are running close to you now who are saying decriminalize coming into the country illegally. Do you believe that should be decriminalized?"}
{"original": "CUOMO: No. No, I don't. No, I don't. I think people should have to get in line."}
{"original": "But if people are coming, because they're actually seeking asylum, they should have a chance to make their case. I would be surging as we did and Barack and I did, surging folks to the border to make those concrete decisions."}
{"original": "Look, the other thing, Chris, is why are they coming? The reason the vast majority of these people coming from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador is because they're in trouble. Crime rates are high. Education is terrible. In Guatemala, you can't turn on a light switch and have them out."}
{"original": "And so what do we do? I put together a $740 million program with Republicans, I might add. At the very end, saying, We'll make a deal with you. You do the following things to make your country better so people don't leave, and we will help you do that."}
{"original": "Just like we did in Colombia. What did we do in Colombia? We went down and said, OK, and I was one of the architects of plan Colombia in Colombia."}
{"original": "I said, Here's the deal. If you have all these crooked cops, all these federal police, we're sending our FBI down. You let us give them -- put them through lie detector tests. Let us tell you who you should fire and tell you the kind of people you should hire. They did and began to change. We can do so much if we're committed."}
{"original": "CUOMO: What do you say to the people party right now when polled who say, Yes, I like Joe Biden, but I think that his ideas are the old ideas? The new ideas I see a Warren, I see a Sanders, I see a Harris."}
{"original": "CUOMO: You poll lower than them. You poll lower than them on ideas for the future. What do you say to them?"}
{"original": "BIDEN: I say to them, Take a look at my ideas. Take a look at my ideas."}

{"original": "BIDEN: Look, it's center left. That's where I am. Where it's not is way left. Now look, but that's what we can find out. That's what this -- that's what this debate is about."}
{"original": "CUOMO: Do you think you need, if you win the nomination, to have a female V.P.?"}
{"original": "BIDEN: I think it would be great to have a female V.P. And if I don't win, it would be great to have a female president."}
{"original": "But the question is, whose issues are best prepared in their wheelhouse? They've demonstrated they know how to deal with them."}
{"original": "CUOMO: Would you consider not having a woman as a V.P.?"}
{"original": "BIDEN: I would -- look, here's the first thing about being a V.P. I've learned. And that is that today's environment, there's so much a president has on his or her plate. They need someone they completely trust, that they're simpatico with, have the same -- the same approach, political approach, and you can delegate significant authority to."}
{"original": "The president when he delegated authority to me from the moon shot to -- to Ukraine, he gave me the authority to make decisions, because he knew I knew where he was. He knew that I knew something it. And he knew we were simpatico. And so that's what I'm looking for."}
{"original": "CUOMO: Do you think a Democrat ticket can win without a woman in one of the two slots?"}
{"original": "BIDEN: Yes, well, the answer is yes. But I think that -- I think it helps having a woman on the ticket. And there's a lot of really qualified women out there."}
{"original": "CUOMO: Is Kamala Harris, assuming she doesn't win outright, is she still somebody you would consider as a running mate?"}
{"original": "BIDEN: Look, one of the things I'm not going to get into, because it got news before, is when I was asked -- I don't even have the nomination, and I'm presuming who I might pick as a vice president. That's easily flipped on me and saying, Well, Biden's being arrogant. Biden thinks I'll have him as my vice president."}
{"original": "So I'm not going to comment on -- on any individual."}
{"original": "A woman came up to me -- I guess it was, I don't know, a month ago. I guess I was in New Hampshire. Said --"}
{"original": "CUOMO: All right. I'm almost done."}
{"original": "BIDEN: Why shouldn't I vote for a woman?"}
{"original": "And I said, You should. If you think that person's most qualified at the moment right now to deal with our problems, vote. I'm not suggesting you shouldn't vote for women."}
{"original": "[07:10:11] Look, I have spent my career, from writing the Violence Against Women Act before that, to say my daughters and granddaughters could do anything, and I mean anything, anything that a man can do. Anything. And so I don't have a doubt in my mind."}
{"original": "And if I started naming some of the people around the country, women who are not running for president, as well, who are fully qualified to be vice president. Again, it would be awful presumptuous, man. Presumptuous. So there's a lot of really qualified women out there."}
{"original": "CUOMO: In terms of -- last question -- in terms of what we haven't seen from Joe Biden yet."}
{"original": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you please (UNINTELLIGIBLE) please?"}
{"original": "CUOMO: I remember your -- hey, Jill, last question. Last question, I promise."}
{"original": "BIDEN: We'll be there in a second."}
{"original": "CUOMO: Last question, I promise. The last thing I remember talking to him about politically with you, Beau, was, you know, what is the quality? You know, because he was asking me about, you know, what do you take from your father in this? What do you -- Beau Biden said to me, Nobody fights like my father."}
{"original": "What does that mean to you to fight harder than anybody else?"}
{"original": "BIDEN: I think it means two things. One, to fight without being personal. To fight and convince. The role of a president is to persuade. Persuade, not just go out and fight."}
{"original": "If they want someone, the clenched fist, a bare-knuckle fight, closed hand, closed heart, they've got one of those guys right now. That's not me."}
{"original": "I have been pretty darn good at bringing people together. The whole idea of America is that when we're together there's not a damn thing we can't do."}
{"original": "And it's -- look, the most incredible response I always get for the last three years is when I talk about how optimistic am I about the future. People know it. They feel it. They know it. They understand it. And we can't stay in this state."}
{"original": "What are we going to do? What are we going do if we can't get along better? And part of it is persuasion and people looking at you and say, I know what he means. He'll stay with what he says, and he'll do what he says he's going to do. And I think that's part of leading. We'll soon find out."}
{"original": "CUOMO: Thank you for the time."}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: Interesting stylistically, interesting substantively. So we will dive into Joe Biden's ideas and his plans and his campaign strategy. Our 2020 campaign reporters are going to weigh in next."}
{"original": "[07:21:44] CAMEROTA: OK, CNN's exclusive interview with former Vice President Joe Biden is chock full of headlines. Biden discussed his healthcare plan and whether undocumented immigrants should be covered. Here's that moment."}
{"original": "CUOMO: On health care, do you believe that undocumented people should have health care in this country?"}
{"original": "BIDEN: I think undocumented people need to have a means by which they can be covered when they're sick. And so the idea is that's what I think we should be doing by building more clinics around the country. Not just for undocumented, for other people. When they're ill, when they're sick. People need -- this is just common decency. They're not going to let somebody --"}
{"original": "BIDEN: Well, I know it is."}
{"original": "CUOMO: Well over 50 percent of people polled say undocumented America -- undocumented people here should not have health care on our dime."}
{"original": "BIDEN: Well, I mean, tell you something, in an emergency, they should have health care. Everybody should. Anybody here in the country. How do you say, You're undocumented. I'm going to let you die, man?"}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: Let's talk about this and so much more. We have Rebecca Buck and Arlette Saenz, CNN political reporters. Arlette has followed the Biden campaign all along the trail."}
{"original": "We also have Toluse Olorunnipa, White House correspondent for The Washington Post. Great to have all of you help us dissect everything that the former vice president said in this interview."}
{"original": "Let's start there, Toluse. So basically, he's saying, you know, there was that moment that everybody on stage raised their hand in the debate for Would you insure undocumented immigrants? And Joe Biden was not the first hand u, and his was the first hand down, actually. So there was a feeling of did he reluctantly join the pack there?"}
{"original": "So here, he clarified. And it sounds like what he's saying is that for catastrophic care. He believes insuring people for catastrophic care, because as he said, What are you going to do. What are you going to say, 'I'm going to let you die, man'?"}
{"original": "TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE WASHINGTON POST: Yes, this is actually very similar to something President Trump said during the 2016 rate, where he was talking about healthcare and providing universal health care. And he said, I'm not going to let people die in the streets."}
{"original": "And it seems like Joe Biden, who said during this interview, I am center left, is sort of staking out a clear position and adding some nuance to show that he's not as far left as the rest of the field, that he is basically trying to win over some of those Trump voters by saying, Listen, we're not going to let people die in the streets. We can be compassionate. But not saying that we're going to give a government health -- healthcare plan, government-funded healthcare to undocumented immigrants."}
{"original": "But in an emergency situation where people are dying on the streets, or really in a tough place, then we can provide healthcare for people, even if they don't have documents, even if they don't have papers."}
{"original": "So it does seem like he's -- he's adding some additional context, additional nuance, and pulling himself back from that far-left position that he seemed to embrace during the debates, where everyone raised their hands and President Trump seized on it by saying, Listen, all of the Democrats want to give taxpayer-funded healthcare to undocumented immigrants."}
{"original": "Joe Biden seems to be saying, Listen, I support taking care of people, being compassionate, but we're not going to provide a full slate of benefits for people who don't have papers."}
{"original": "AVLON: And Toluse, that's a great example of a policy-specific example of the larger fight for the Democratic Party that's going on."}
{"original": "And Rebecca, Joe Biden has been positioned as someone who's a centrist, on the right of his party respectively. You've covered Congress."}
{"original": "And so you know that, I mean, if you look back at his voting record in 2007, The National Journal did an analysis saying he was the third most-liberal senator."}
{"original": "[07:20:06] So is this a case of the Democratic Party moving so far left that it's moved him by? Or is it a case of the far left just having a louder voice than the rank and file?"}
{"original": "REBECCA BUCK, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: You know, I think it's the latter, that right now the progressive wing of the Democratic Party is incredibly vocal, incredibly powerful in Washington."}
{"original": "But when you look at the polling that we've seen throughout this election cycle, looking issue by issue where Democratic voters are and also, do they identify more as moderate, centrist Democrats or liberal Democrats, you actually see that the Democratic voters still are, by and large, quite moderate."}
{"original": "And so this is Joe Biden's case that he's been making as to why he is the best candidate to be the Democratic nominee and take the party into the general election, because many Democratic voters out there across the country still are quite moderate. They aren't as far left as some of the conversation we've been hearing in Washington, for example. And he is sort of getting the big share of these moderate voters at this point."}
{"original": "But as we've seen in the polling, his lead is very tenuous, very fragile at this point. And so you have Kamala Harris and others trying to get that moderate piece of the Democratic vote. And that was exactly why she made the play she did in the debate."}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: He spoke directly to that. So Arlette, we heard the former vice president tell Chris about how, basically, he believes being moderate is the way to go and the winning strategy. So let's listen to that moment."}
{"original": "BIDEN: Look who won the races. Look who won last time out. We had -- and by the way, I think -- I think Ocasio-Cortez is a brilliant, bright woman, but she won a primary."}
{"original": "In the general election fights, who won? Mainstream Democrats who were very progressive on social issues and very strong on education, health care."}
{"original": "Look, my north star is the middle class. When the middle class does well, everybody does well."}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: So Arlette, that sounds like that will be his kind of overarching message for his campaign."}
{"original": "ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. It really is, Alisyn. And you've now heard Biden basically prescribe these two brands to himself. One, that he's center left, and two, that he's an Obama-Biden Democrat."}
{"original": "And so going forward, and as you have seen throughout this campaign, Biden has really pushed back against that notion that there has been this leftward tilt in the party."}
{"original": "He had also talked about how Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a brilliant and bright woman. But he just doesn't think that the party has gone that far left, as you have heard him also say. He has made that argument, that there are very loud voices in the -- in the Democratic -- on the leftward side of the party."}
{"original": "But going forward, you know, Biden, he has said that he doesn't want to make any of these criticisms personal. But he's also starting to drill in on some of those issues."}
{"original": "You've seen him really keep his focus on President Trump throughout this campaign. But in that interview, he's staking out some very clear policy differences when it Medicare for all. Also decriminalizing border crossing. That's something that former HUD secretary Julian Castro has really led on, that Biden is now pushing back against."}
{"original": "So you're finally starting to see him really trying to make that differentiation between himself and those other Democratic candidates, as he has to get through them first in order to get to President Trump."}
{"original": "AVLON: That was a fascinating point he kept making. I'm a fighter but without making it personal. A president needs to be a persuader."}
{"original": "Toluse, one of the most fascinating moments of that particular segment of the interview is when he talks about what he might be looking for in a V.P. Let's take a listen."}
{"original": "CUOMO: Do you think you need, if you win the nomination, to have a female V.P.?"}
{"original": "BIDEN: I think it would be great to have a female V.P., and if I don't win, it would be great to have a female president."}
{"original": "CUOMO: Do you think a Democrat ticket can win without a woman in one of the two slots?"}
{"original": "BIDEN: Yes, well, the answer is yes. But I don't think that -- I think it helps having a woman on the ticket. And there's a lot of really qualified women out there."}
{"original": "AVLON: Toluse, is that almost a presumptuous question to follow on? Does Biden run a risk of getting too detailed on that kind of a conversation at this point? OLORUNNIPA: Yes. You could sort of see the wheels spinning in his"}
{"original": "head and not wanting to go too far in answering that question and deciding whether or not to name any names or whether or not to sort of engage with the question of whether or not he would support Senator Harris as a potential V.P."}
{"original": "He had talked about that in the past, and he got a little bit of pushback for that and sort of seeming presumptuous, seeming as if he had already believed himself to be the nominee."}
{"original": "In this case, he sort of stopped himself from going that far and just saying that there are tons of qualified women who could be the vice president. And also even sort of giving a nod, saying that if he did not win the nomination, that he'd love to see a family presidential nominee."}
{"original": "[07:25:02] So it did seem like he was sort of worried about being seen as being too presumptuous there and decided not to fully engage, and used it as an opportunity to speak to the women voters who are considering him but also considering the history of potentially having the first female president."}
{"original": "The president -- or the vice president wanted to show that he supports those voters either choosing him or potentially choosing a woman to -- to be the nominee instead."}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: Rebecca, I want to talk about style for a second. There's a lot of substance, obviously, in this interview. But stylistically, not every format is for every candidate. And Joe Biden seems to really come alive in that particular format with Chris Cuomo. He -- his eyes were bright. He looked energetic. He was able to kind of show off his institutional base of knowledge, from NATO to North Korea to Russia, because he has experience with all of those countries."}
{"original": "And he was able to kind of tout that in a way that somehow on stage with ten other people he seemed deferential. You know, he says in this interview he didn't want to engage in the scrum. But some people rose to the occasion of engaging in the scrum, you know. That debate stage was Kamala Harris' format, I would say."}
{"original": "And so what was your impression of how Joe Biden will come off to voters in this interview?"}
{"original": "BUCK: Well, you know, he came off, I think, so much better than he did on the debate stage, than he has in some of the early cycles, news cycles of this Democratic primary. And so it begs the question why hasn't he been doing more one on one, sit-down interviews like this? Why hasn't he been going out there to present his story, to explain his positions, to defend his positions in a way that wasn't as confrontational as what you might see on the debate stage? You know, I think this format does him a lot of favors."}
{"original": "And he's been trying, in this race, to sort of, as you suggested, remain above the fray. To present himself as a front-runner return, as a statesman, as someone who's above all of the squabbling of the Democratic primary with two dozen candidates. But we're seeing that he hasn't been succeeding in that."}
{"original": "And so I think this shows he needs to engage a little bit more. He needs to get out there."}
{"original": "AVLON: it's a fascinating, important interview by Chris Cuomo. My guess is we will be seeing more of it."}
{"original": "Rebecca Buck in Houston, where Vice President Biden will be speaking at the National Education Association later today, along with many other candidates."}
{"original": "Arlette, Toluse, thank you so much for joining us."}
{"original": "And if you're just waking up, we're going to play our entire interview with Joe Biden in the next hour."}
{"original": "CAMEROTA: All right. Meanwhile, former Vice President Biden says his position on bussing is not different from Kamala Harris's after all. Does her campaign agree after all of this? We've ask her communications director. With us next."}
{"original": "After a series of crushing defeats in the two Super Tuesday contests, Sanders has fallen far behind Biden in the critical race for delegates. But the champion of the party's progressive wing sought to draw out the ideological contrasts with Biden as the former vice president argued that Americans are looking for results, not a revolution."}
{"original": "As the two candidates tangled over policy throughout the night, Biden repeatedly called for unity among Democrats and made major news by stating he would pick a woman as his running mate."}
{"original": "If I'm elected president, my Cabinet, my administration will look like the country and I commit that I will, in fact, appoint -- pick a woman to be vice president, Biden said. There are a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow. I would pick a woman to be my vice president."}
{"original": "Both Biden and Sanders said half their Cabinet advisers would be women to match the makeup of the nation, and when pressed Sanders said he would probably also pick a female vice presidential running mate."}
{"original": "In all likelihood, I will, Sanders said. For me, it's not just nominating a woman. It is making sure that we have a progressive woman and there are progressive women out there. So my very strong tendency is to move in that direction."}
{"original": "The two men met for their first one-on-one debate Sunday night at a time when many Americans are staying at home in an unprecedented national effort to slow the spread of novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 3,400 people in 49 states and led to at least 65 deaths."}
{"original": "Underscoring the extraordinary moment in this nation's history, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance moments before the two men took the stage in CNN's Washington bureau -- urging Americans to cancel or postpone in-person gatherings that consist of 50 or more people for the next eight weeks."}
{"original": "Biden, with a grin, offered his elbow as a greeting to Sanders before the two men took their place behind the podiums, which were spaced more than six feet apart in keeping with government's guidelines for social distancing."}
{"original": "As they both outlined their respective plans to take on the coronavirus, they agreed that government should cover not only the health care costs of those who get sick, but also any lost wages, missed rent or mortgage payments and childcare costs incurred as a result of the illness."}
{"original": "Beyond that, however, the debate illustrated the stark disagreements between the Vermont senator and the former vice president on how far they would go in attempting to restructure government to address income inequality in America."}
{"original": "Casting himself as a champion of working people, Sanders argued that the pandemic has exposed the fragility of the US economy by illuminating the fact that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck."}
{"original": "We've got people who are struggling, working two or three jobs to put food on the table. What's going to happen to them? Sanders said."}
{"original": "JUST WATCHED Biden, Sanders debate whether 'Medicare for All' would save lives Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Biden, Sanders debate whether 'Medicare for All' would save lives 02:46"}
{"original": "But Biden argued that most Americans are in no mood for revolution, as they look to their commander-in-chief to marshal all of the resources of government stop the pandemic and keep their families safe."}
{"original": "Alluding to plans Sanders supports -- like a wealth tax and Medicare for All -- Biden said the current crisis is not going to be solved by a change in tax policy now. It's not going to be solved by how we deal with health care, and then pivoted to his plans for emergency hospitals, enhanced coordination with other nations and his agenda for expanding the nation's testing capacity."}
{"original": "The former vice president said he would make sure every state in the union had 10 places where Americans could access drive-through testing, while also engaging the Defense Department and Federal Emergency Management Agency to set up emergency 500-bed hospital sites to triage patients."}
{"original": "JUST WATCHED Sanders: Trump is undermining the good work of scientists Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Sanders: Trump is undermining the good work of scientists 01:52"}
{"original": "He added that he would try to swiftly deal with the economic fallout from the crisis by helping Americans cover their mortgages and allowing small businesses to borrow interest-free loans."}
{"original": "If he had the power to act immediately, Sanders said he would move aggressively to make sure that every person in the country who becomes infected would know that they would not lose income, and assure them that all payments will be made. He also touted his plan for Medicare for All as a critical part of the safety net in the midst of this crisis."}
{"original": "I want every person in this country to understand what when you get sick, you go to the doctor. When you get sick, if you have the virus, that will be paid for, Sanders said, explaining what he would want to occur under his administration."}
{"original": "Coming at a moment of national uncertainty, the debate underscored the very different positions the two candidates find themselves in right now as Biden has surged ahead of Sanders in delegates. Sanders was the aggressor throughout the night, repeatedly challenging Biden's lengthy Senate record and suggesting the former Delaware senator had acted for political expediency instead of taking more controversial positions that Sanders did."}
{"original": "An hour into the debate, Sanders reeled off a list of difficult votes that both candidates took in Congress, noting that he and Biden voted differently on the Defense of Marriage Act, the bankruptcy bill and the war in Iraq, which he has said raised questions about Biden's judgment."}
{"original": "I voted against the war in Iraq, which was also a tough vote. You voted for it, Sanders said. I voted against the disastrous trade agreements like (North American Free Trade Agreement), which cost this country over 4 million good-paying jobs. You voted for it. I voted against the Hyde Amendment, which denies low-income women the right to get an abortion. You have consistently voted for it. I don't know what your position is today. ... We can argue about the merits of the bill. It takes courage sometimes to vote and do the right thing."}
{"original": "Biden, with a lighter touch, faulted Sanders for voting against the Brady Bill, which contained measures to try to prevent gun violence like enhanced background checks and noted that Sanders voted against legislation that prevented gun manufacturers from being sued. Still, Sanders pointed to his consistency, which is what has endeared him most to his supporters."}
{"original": "We can argue this or that bill, but what I'm suggesting is that in this time of crisis when we are living in a really, really unsettling world -- economically, from a health care perspective with the coronavirus -- the people of America know my record, the Vermont senator said."}
{"original": "Biden's priority at this time, however, is to try and persuade Sanders supporters to back him if he becomes the Democratic nominee, and he often noted areas where they agreed on Sunday -- including his new support for the bankruptcy plan of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and a new announcement that he'll support free college tuition for students in households making less than $125,000."}
{"original": "Character of the nation is on the ballot, Biden said. Sen. Sanders and I both agree we need -- health care should be a right, not a privilege. We both agree we have to deal with student debt. We both agree we have to deal with education and access to education. We both agree that we have a New Green Deal to deal with the existential threat that faces humanity. We disagree on the detail of how we do it. But we don't disagree on the principle. We fundamentally disagree with this president on everything."}
{"original": "Some of their sharpest exchanges were over electability. Noting the youth and energy of his supporters, the Vermont senator argued that Biden would not be able to muster the kind of excitement that would be need among his backers to take on Trump."}
{"original": "Sanders framed his coalition as a multiracial, multi-generational grassroots movement, acknowledging Biden's advantage in the delegate count but pointing to the energy of his supporters."}
{"original": "Joe has won more states than I have. But here's what we are winning, Sanders said. We are winning the ideological struggle. Even in Mississippi where Joe won a major victory, it turns out that a pretty good majority of the folks there believe in Medicare for All. That's true in almost every state in this country."}
{"original": "We are winning the generational struggle. Depending on the state, we're winning people 50 years of age or younger. Big time -- people 30 years of age and younger, Sanders said. Look if I lose this thing -- Joe wins -- Joe, I will be there for you. But I have my doubts about how you win a general election against Trump -- who will be a very, very tough opponent -- unless you have energy, excitement, the largest voter turnout in history."}
{"original": "In one of his more cutting retorts, Biden pointed to his victories and the rise in turnout in many of the states where he has done well, arguing that his message is resonating across the board."}
{"original": "Let's get this straight. The energy and excitement that's taken place so far has been for me, Biden said. Seventy percent turnout increase in Virginia. I can go down the list. ... And I didn't even have the money to compete with this man in those states."}
{"original": "In one of the more human moments, both candidates were asked how they were confronting the unique risks facing Americans of advanced age with the coronavirus."}
{"original": "Biden and Sanders have both suspended their rallies, directed their aides to work from home and have avoided shaking hands."}
{"original": "Sanders, who is 78 and had a heart attack last year, said he's very careful about the people I am interacting with."}
{"original": "I'm using a lot of soap and hand sanitizers to make sure that I do not get the infection, the Vermont senator said. And I have to say, thank God right now I do not have any symptoms and I feel very grateful for that."}
{"original": "Biden, who is 77, pointedly noted that he does not have underlying conditions and said he was in good health."}
{"original": "I wash my hands God knows how many times a day, Biden said. I carry with me, in my bag outside here, hand sanitizer. I don't know how many times a day I use that. I make sure I don't touch my face and so on. I'm taking all the precautions we're telling everybody else to take."}
{"original": "This story has been updated with additional developments throughout the debate."}
{"original": "(CNN) Jobless Americans in many states are starting to see heftier unemployment checks, thanks to the $900 billion relief package Congress approved in late December."}
{"original": "But many whose benefits ran out last year will have to wait for their payments to restart. And freelancers, independent contractors and certain people who can't work because of coronavirus restrictions will have to provide more proof of employment when filing new applications or continuing their claims."}
{"original": "The new congressional relief deal provides a $300 weekly federal enhancement in benefits through March 14. And it extends by 11 weeks the two pandemic programs that were created in the $2 trillion CARES Act in March and were set to expire at the end of 2020."}
{"original": "The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program expanded jobless benefits to gig workers, freelancers, independent contractors, the self-employed and certain people affected by the coronavirus. The Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program provided an extra 13 weeks of payments to those who exhaust their regular state benefits."}
{"original": "Both programs will close to new applicants on March 14, but continue through April 5 for existing claimants who have not yet reached the maximum number of weeks."}
{"original": "The extension of benefits comes as the nation's jobs recovery has hit a wall. he extension of benefits comes as the nation's jobs recovery has hit a wall. First-time unemployment claims soared last week, with 965,000 people filing for benefits, substantially higher than the week before. And the economy lost 140,000 jobs last month, the first monthly decline since April."}
{"original": "About half of states should be paying the $300 weekly boost by the end of this week, said Michele Evermore, senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project. That's in line with experts' projection that it would take two to three weeks for many state agencies to reprogram the new measures into their systems."}
{"original": "Several states, including New York and California, moved quickly to put parts of the new law in place. The California Employment Development Department, for instance, has paid a total of $434 million in enhanced federal payments to more than 1 million claimants, as of Tuesday."}
{"original": "In Georgia, nearly 167,000 out-of-work residents received their newly extended pandemic benefits and almost 300,000 jobless claimants got the extra $300, as of early January, the state agency said."}
{"original": "However, more than 239,000 Georgians who exhausted pandemic benefits on or before December 26 will have to wait a few more weeks to start the 11-week extension, though payments will be retroactive."}
{"original": "We're pushing as quickly as we possibly can, said Kersha Cartwright, an agency spokeswoman."}
{"original": "In other states, unemployed residents have yet to get the benefits in the relief package."}
{"original": "Laid-off Ohioans, for instance, can't submit either new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance applications or ongoing weekly claims at the moment. The state Department of Job and Family Services expects those who were already approved to be able to file by the third week of January. And it expects to start issuing the $300 benefit by then too."}
{"original": "The latest relief package requires those seeking Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits to submit additional paperwork that substantiates that they had a job or were self-employed."}
{"original": "Last year, state agencies could simply accept attestations from claimants about their employment and income. But lawmakers tightened the rules partly because the program, which opened up the unemployment system to many Americans who had never been eligible, has been contending with widespread fraud."}
{"original": "The jobless who apply for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits before January 31 and receive a payment on or after December 27 must provide documentation to their state agency within 90 days, according to the US Department of Labor. Those who file a new application on or after January 31 must submit the paperwork within 21 days."}
{"original": "Proof of employment could include paycheck stubs, W-2 tax forms or earnings statements, while proof of self-employment could include federal employer identification numbers, business licenses, tax returns or business receipts, the agency said."}
{"original": "Oregon, for instance, is still waiting for more information about the new required documentation, among other program changes. The state agency doesn't yet know when it will start sending payments to people with new pandemic unemployment claims or to those whose benefits ran out last year."}
{"original": "States have some flexibility in the documentation requirements and the deadlines, Evermore said. However, this could broaden the disparity between states, with some instituting strict guidelines and others less so."}
{"original": "In Georgia, the state agency is still determining the best way for jobless residents to fulfill the documentation requirements, Cartwright said. The new rules place a big burden on state agencies to both collect and verify the paperwork, she said."}
{"original": "It will slow everything down for everyone, Evermore said."}
{"original": "We hear a lot about how college is expensive, but many folks don't realize quite how costly a degree can be these days. According to the College Board, the average cost of tuition and fees for the 2016-2017 school year looked something like this:"}
{"original": "Of course, that's just one piece of the puzzle. Room and board -- an oft-necessary component of college attendance -- averages $10,440 at public colleges and $11,890 at private ones."}
{"original": "When we look at these costs, it's easy to see why so many low- and middle-income families struggle to pay for college."}
{"original": "But for a large number of higher earners, most universities are out of reach as well. According to research by the Institute for Higher Education Policy (IHEP), even families earning over $100,000 a year can't afford nearly 60% of U.S. colleges."}
{"original": "Now IHEP defines affordability as the means to pay for college after saving 10% of one's discretionary income for the 10-year period leading up to college, combined with earnings from a student working 10 hours per week during college."}
{"original": "Given that most folks are advised to save 10% of their income for retirement, setting aside another 10% for college is a pretty tall order. It's therefore demoralizing to learn that even those who manage to hit that threshold still wind up falling short in terms of being able to afford most learning institutions."}
{"original": "That said, just because some folks might very well be saving 10% of their income for college doesn't mean that they're saving in the most efficient manner possible."}
{"original": "And that could spell the difference between affording college or winding up with a ridiculous pile of debt for privilege of having a child attend the university of his or her choice."}
{"original": "Find a smarter way to save"}
{"original": "While setting aside money for college is a smart move off the bat, where you put that cash could have a huge impact on your eventual ability, or lack thereof, to pay those bills."}
{"original": "Fidelity Investments reports that about 40% of families are now saving for college via a 529 plan, which represents an increase from previous years. And while 529s are by no means the only option for saving for college, they're a far more efficient route than savings and traditional brokerage accounts."}
{"original": "Though you don't get an immediate federal tax break for contributing to a 529, once you fund an account, that money gets to grow tax-free. As long as you use that money for qualified higher education purposes, you'll get to keep your ending balance in full."}
{"original": "Traditional brokerage accounts, by contrast, require you to pay taxes on your gains year after year. This means that if you sell anything in your account at a profit, you'll lose a chunk of those proceeds to taxes, leaving you less money to reinvest. Along these lines, if you leave your investments alone during your college savings period and only sell them off once the time comes to start tacking those tuition bills, you'll lose a portion of your eventual earnings to taxes as well."}
{"original": "Then there are savings accounts, which not only impose taxes on interest income but offer very little in the way of returns to begin with. These days, you'll be lucky to get a solid 1% per year out of your savings account, making it a rather inefficient tool."}
{"original": "Related: How should I save for my kid's college education?"}
{"original": "Imagine you earn $100,000 a year, and sock away 10% of that, or $10,000 annually, for 10 years. With a regular old savings account, you'll grow your college fund to roughly $104,000 -- not all too impressive considering that $100,000 of that stems from principal contributions."}
{"original": "On the other hand, if you save in a traditional brokerage account or 529, your investments might very well generate an average annual 7% return, which would leave you with $138,000 after 10 years' time."}
{"original": "Here's the catch though -- if you have a traditional brokerage account whose investments you sell off to access that cash, you'll lose a portion of your earnings to capital gains taxes. Assuming you're in the 25% bracket, those taxes will knock a good $10,000 off your $38,000 in gains. With a 529, however, you'll get to use that $138,000 in full, as long as it's applied to qualified college costs."}
{"original": "Now one major drawback of opening a 529 is that if you don't end up using that money for qualified purposes, you'll face a 10% penalty on the gains portion of your account. It's for this reason that you might consider other college savings avenues, like a Roth IRA, if you're eligible to open one. (Even if you can't fund one directly, you can always convert a traditional IRA to a Roth.)"}

{"original": "No matter how you decide to save for college, you should do so in a manner that lets you maximize your gains and minimize your taxes. Even if you're a relatively high earner, covering the cost of college is likely to be a challenge, so the smarter you are about how you save, the better your chances of meeting your ultimate goals."}

{"original": "THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED."}
{"original": "[10:00:12] CHRISTI PAUL, CNN ANCHOR: Good morning, Saturday, November 24th. We are always so grateful to have your company. I am Christi Paul."}
{"original": "MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN ANCHOR: And I am Martin Savidge in for Victor Blackwell. The top stories this hour. A dire government report on climate warns that thousands of lives and billions of dollars are at stake."}
{"original": "PAUL: In Alabama, a manhunt under way right now for the gunman who opened fire at a mall Thanksgiving night. The man killed at the scene was misidentified as the shooter."}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: Meanwhile, President Trump is preparing for his new reality with a House controlled by Democrats."}
{"original": "PAUL: And protests over the rising price of fuel. Look what that's left on the streets of Paris right now, police firing tear gas and deploying water cannons to try to keep the peace."}
{"original": "again, so grateful to have you here. This morning there is this stark assessment of the devastating effect of leaving climate change unchecked. A panel of scientists warning thousands of Americans could die premature deaths, the economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars if global warming is not addressed."}
{"original": "Scientists behind the study didn't just look at climate shifts over one day or even one year. They looked at long term trends here."}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: And joining us now is CNN's Allison Chinchar and Kim Cobb, climate scientist at Georgia Tech university. Good morning to both of you."}
{"original": "Allison, you were on this call. And there was some interesting insight that came out the way questions were either asked or answered or not. ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes. So the main focus of the"}
{"original": "phone call was to talk about the report and the main takeaway from this was to show the direct impacts of climate change on Americans' lives. Usually these reports are from a global standpoint, but this was really a focus on the United States. They talked about the three industries that would be most impacted, real estate, health care, and agriculture being those."}
{"original": "But probably the most interesting thing about that phone call was at the end they did a question and answer segment, and they had numerous people ask about the timeline of this being issued Friday. But one person directly asked, they said this is the official White House climate report, and it says climate change is real. But you have the president of the United States saying it's not. What are we supposed to believe, the White House report or the White House spokesperson? And they refused to answer it. The moderator simply would not allow any of these panelists to answer that question. I just found that odd that these are the scientists, they wrote the report, and they're not even really allowed to answer that simple question."}
{"original": "PAUL: Did you get a sense they wanted to answer the question? Did anybody start to answer?"}
{"original": "CHINCHAR: You could hear, things like that where people would start to, but the moderator, and I know that's their job is to decide who gets to answer the question. But I did get the sense that if they were allowed, maybe not all of them, but some of them would have liked to have answered that question."}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: What about the question of timing. In other words, you release this at a time when --"}
{"original": "CHINCHAR: The moderator shut that one down as well. Their response to that was simply we want the focus of this to be about the content of this, not about the timing of release."}
{"original": "PAUL: So with that said, Kim, just so the viewers know, Kim Cobb, of course, with us now, that you go to Christmas Island every two weeks. This is your area of study. Christmas Island in the Pacific, of course. Is what you heard from this report, does it correlate with what you found in 18 years of research?"}
{"original": "KIM COBB, CLIMATE SCIENTIST, GEORGIA TECH UNIVERSITY: Yes, absolutely. So as a climate scientist, some of us are in the business of digging back into the past to look at climate extremes before the rise of carbon dioxide. And of course what we see locked into records is coming up into the present, things are getting warmer, and the natural climate extremes that I study are getting more extreme, perfectly consistent with the findings of this report."}
{"original": "PAUL: And how -- I'm sorry. Go ahead, Martin."}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: I was just going to ask, we've had a number of reports that have been done over the years. What makes this one so important, and why should we carefully look at it? COBB: Yes. I think these reports come out every several years, and"}
{"original": "this one I think caught my eye because it has ratcheted up some impacts that we had bigger uncertainties about in the past, and now with this report they are becoming clearer than ever. And that's unfortunately in the worst direction. So sea level estimates have ticked up. Our attribution of climate extremes has improved since the last report."}
{"original": "And so now we're really facing with a lot more certainty some of the very, very damaging types of climate exchange and impacts. And unfortunately, this report is just another exclamation mark on a year of dizzying records with wildfires, temperature extremes, heat waves, and of course the hurricane season in the southeast."}
{"original": "PAUL: So are we in the thick of this now based on what you ticked down, the list of what we're dealing with, or can you give us, Allison, some sort of a timeline when we're going to see this ratcheted up, or again, are we in it?"}
{"original": "[10:05:01] CHINCHAR: So you have some aspects that are already taking place. You have coastal flooding, places like Florida, the Carolinas, up and down the east coast. They call it sunny day flooding in Florida where it is not raining but they're getting those floods from the tides. It is a great example of that sea level rise."}
{"original": "Other things, it really is, it's going to take several more decades before you really start to notice large scale issues with. But the fact of this report was not just to chalk -- and I think that's what separates this report. This wasn't just the here is the doom and gloom. This specific report actually gave solutions to the problem. Here's how we can fix the ones that are happening now, and here's how we can fix the ones that we know will happen down the road."}
{"original": "CHINCHAR: So they talk about certain things in areas of the west. They have this drought program that's already existed and it is meant for farmers and ranchers on how they can to start to prepare for drought, for heatwaves, and how it would affect their livestock. The Acadiana Group in Louisiana that basically was created to help assess flooding risks for areas along the southeast. So again, you have these programs that are already being established to help look into the future of what can we do to mitigate some of these issues that we know will take place."}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: Professor, is it too late? Can we still prevent it?"}
{"original": "COBB: Absolutely not. We have so much work to do. And so, as Allison was saying, some of that work is just reading into those regional reports, the report has region by region what are the expected impacts, and thinking about how scientists can work with people in their communities and policymakers to protect those communities today from the impacts that are coming down the pike today, actually. And so the other bucket of the recommendations that they make is of course to get on top of our emissions and start to make sure that we are not baking in more risk than we need to. It is absolutely not too late and we really have time to get to work."}
{"original": "But this report does stress that the time to do so is now. And it is really important for American health and well-being and economic prosperity that we take this very seriously."}
{"original": "PAUL: Allison Chinchar and Kim Cobb, we appreciate you both being here. Thank you."}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: Breaking news in Paris. Demonstrators are taking to the streets over rising fuel costs, gathering in the French capital to express frustration with President Emmanuel Macron after tax hikes on diesel and gas. Macron is also pushing incentives to purchase electric vehicles."}
{"original": "PAUL: Police are using tear gas, and, you can see there, water cannons to combat some of the, now we're told 8,000 protesters that have assembled there. Government officials are blaming far right extremists for inflaming the tensions there. CNN senior international correspondent Jim Bittermann is live in Paris for us. And Jim, I know you are standing right above this crowd along the Champs-Elysees. What are you seeing, hearing, feeling at this hour?"}
{"original": "JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We're now six hours into the protest today. I'll just show you a little bit of what's going on right at our doorstep downstairs on the Champs- Elysees. These are yellow vested protesters, people who are protesting the rise in gas prices, but they've been joined by a lot of other people that are protesting all sorts of things, high taxes in France, the high cost of living. There are some pensioners in the crowd worried about their pensions and their retirement."}
{"original": "And they have been going up and down the avenue, the police have been using the water cannon, you maybe able to see it in the background there in action. And setting barricades out and then setting fire to barricades, which is what we have seen practically all afternoon long here. It does not seem to be at this point that the crowd is dispersing, but on the other hand the overall crowd is substantially smaller than the crowds that gathered in France a week ago. This started with a crowd of 230,000 people across the country. Today according to the interior minister it's about 23,000. So a substantially less number of protesters out, but these on the Champs- Elysees have been far more dramatic than we saw last week, in fact probably as dramatic as I've ever seen on the Champs-Elysees."}
{"original": "Authorities said they were going to try to keep people away from here because of all the high value stores and fashion boutiques and what not, and clearly that did not happen. Christi, Martin?"}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: Jim, the explosions and sounds that we're hearing in the background, what are they?"}
{"original": "BITTERMANN: Well, they're basically -- some of them flash bombs that the police are using, and some tear gas. But also, the other thing is the demonstrators have brought with them fireworks, and we have seen a number of demonstrators set off fireworks, that's really what the explosions are. There's nothing that, as far as I can tell, that has caused much damage, although we did see one demonstrator injured a short while ago who was right next to one of these when they went off. And we have seen, as you can probably hear in the background, a regrouping of the protesters as the police try to move in to push them off the avenue."}
{"original": "[10:10:08] PAUL: So Jim, we're listening to that as well and we're looking at these pictures, and I am wondering, President Macron has to be watching this as well. You mentioned earlier how low his approval rating is right now. Is there any indication how the government is going to address this?"}
{"original": "BITTERMANN: There is some, Christi. In fact, President Macron said that he is going to address the situation on Tuesday. We're not sure what he is going to do. I would suspect there might be a decrease in the gas tax announced or something like that, but he doesn't have a whole lot of room to maneuver here, given the economy in France and that sort of thing. And he's also been very resolute about saying that he is going to carry out government reforms. Some of the protesters today, for example, are against the reforms he announced from the first days in his office, the reforms to the labor laws in this country. He said that's what we have to do to get the economy moving here. That was met very positively by a lot of businessmen in the country, but now two years after those reforms were announced, in fact this is what we are having on the streets as people feel the bite of the reforms and the high taxes and whatnot. Christi?"}
{"original": "PAUL: Jim Bittermann, I'll say it again, take good care of yourself and your team there. Thank you, sir. We appreciate it."}
{"original": "All right, so while much of the focus is on climate change right now in Washington, there is a deadline looming there. In a little more than a month, Democrats will take control of the House of Representatives."}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: Let's bring in CNN senior White House correspondent Jeff Zeleny. Jeff, President Trump's financial ties to Saudi Arabia is near the top of the Democrats' agenda, but it is not the only thing."}
{"original": "JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good morning. It is not the only thing, Martin. This really is the last month that the president will be enjoying a full Republican control of the House and Senate. And he's already getting early sign of what some Democrats who will be coming into House of Representatives to assume control of their investigations and oversight, of what they're looking at."}
{"original": "And one of the things, Adam Schiff, he's the incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he said yesterday that he in fact wants to look at any links between the Trump administration, the Trump Organization, and Saudi Arabia, financial links. Of course one thing else on the list for Democrats is the finances of the Trump Organization, his tax returns, something he has never wanted to give up. So something is going to change in Washington. We'll see how successful Democrats are in getting these from the president."}
{"original": "But without question, it is going to be a new era, a new moment for the president when the new year begins. But before that, the president on the golf course here in south Florida, he is thinking about some changes of his cabinet. He says he may have some before too long here. But as of now, sunny day in Florida. I think it's pretty much a vacation weekend for the president."}
{"original": "PAUL: Jeff Zeleny, I hope you enjoy a little bit of the sunshine yourself. Thank you."}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: And breaking news this hour. The gunman in an Alabama mall shooting Thanksgiving night still on the loose."}
{"original": "PAUL: Here's the thing. Authorities now say the 21-year-old man killed by an officer at the mall, quote, likely did not fire the rounds that injured two people. CNN reporter Natasha Chen with us now. So essentially they're saying there was misidentification here of who the culprit."}
{"original": "NATASHA CHEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. So overnight the Hoover police department released this statement on Facebook, and the statement said our department does not typically issue media updates during an internal investigation, but there was information discussed with local media last night that merits update and clarification. The initial report was that two men gotten into a fight of some kind at the mall that resulted in a 21-year-old shooting an unarmed 18-year- old, and that victim was taken to the hospital."}
{"original": "The update now says the 21-year-old identified as Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford may have been involved in some aspect of the altercation, but he likely did not fire the rounds that injured the 18-year-old victim. Police say Bradford did flee the scene and brandished his weapon. That's when an armed Hoover police officer who was working mall security shot and killed him."}
{"original": "So if he is not the one who shot the 18-year-old, there's someone out there who did. Police say they now believe there were more than two people involved in the initial fight. They say at least one gunman is still at large who could be responsible for the 18-year-old victim as well as a 12-year-old girl who caught in the crossfire. She was also taken to the hospital."}
{"original": "I reached out to the agency that has taken over this investigation to find out exactly how many suspects they're looking for, and whether they believe Bradford fired any rounds at all. Last we heard the officer involved in the shooting is on administrative leave while they investigate."}
{"original": "[10:15:01] PAUL: Natasha Chen, thank you for the update."}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: And still to come, an American was killed during a mission trip to a remote island near India. We talked to a leader of the organization he was affiliated with and got her reaction to the news."}
{"original": "PAUL: So we have some new details this morning about a letter an American missionary wrote just before he was killed on an island near India. John Chau gave the letter to fisherman before he left their boat for the island."}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: And it shows that he knew the tribes, people living in isolation there, were dangerous. Chau wrote, You guys might think I am crazy in all this, but I think it is worth it to declare Jesus to these people. Please do not be angry at them or at God if I get killed. CNN's Polo Sandoval has more details."}
{"original": "POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is one of the oldest and most isolated tribes in the world. Authorities say they're responsible for last week's killing of American missionary John Allen Chau."}
{"original": "[10:20:06] This archived footage from Survival International provides some of the few existing images of the tribe known as the Sentinelese. They live in complete isolation on the tiny island of North Sentinel. According to Indian officials, Chau illegally paid fisherman to take him to the isolated island hoping to convert the tribe to Christianity. Authorities believe he first canoed to shore on November 16th, deliberately disregarding an established perimeter around the island."}
{"original": "According to journal entries left with the fisherman and shared with the Washington Post, the 26-years-old wrote, I hollered my name is John. I love you. And Jesus loves you. He was then reportedly shot at by a member of the tribe with an arrow, piercing his bible. The next day, Chau made a second attempt, but never returned."}
{"original": "The fisherman he hired later reported seeing the young man's body buried on the beach by tribe members. Chau's last entry in his journal reads You guys might think I'm crazy in all this, but I think it is worthwhile to declare Jesus to these people. God, I don't want to die. In 2006, the same tribe killed two poachers who had been illegally fishing near their island. Survival Interview, a group advocating for tribal people, believe the natives decision to be remain isolated should be respected."}
{"original": "SOPHIE GRIG, SURVIVAL INTERNATIONAL SENIOR RESEARCHER: They've made it very clear they don't want contact. Somebody comes, they have no idea what he is coming for and why. I think it is far more self- defense than it is murder."}
{"original": "SANDOVAL: On social media, Chau's family wrote their son loved God, life, helping those in need, and had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people, and forgive those reportedly responsible for his death, the wrote. All they can do is wait to do is find out when or if their son's body will be recovered."}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: Earlier we spoke to Mary Ho, the international executive leader of the missionary organization John Chau worked for, and we got her perspective on the trip."}
{"original": "MARY HO, INTERNATIONAL EXECUTIVE LEADER, ALL NATIONS: He has been preparing his whole life for this. We knew he was very well prepared. There were several people who would have been happy to go with him, but this is typical of John. I think he did not want to endanger other people's lives. And so finally he went alone. And that was his decision. But there were others who were willing to go with him."}
{"original": "PAUL: Breaking news out of Paris right now. Protesters clashing with police on the Champs-Elysees. Tear gas, water cannons all being used to try to suppress the demonstrators who are angry about rising fuel prices. We have the latest from Paris, next."}
{"original": "SAVIDGE: And then a devastating government assessment warns unchecked climate change will cost thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. What will the president do about it?"}
{"original": "[10:27:24] SAVIDGE: We are continuing to follow breaking news out of Paris. Thousands of people have taken to the streets to protest rising fuel costs. Police have now fired tear gas, water cannons have been brought to bear as well to try to disperse the crowd. This has grown in the level of violence that we have been witnessing, not only the response from authorities but there are fires that are now being set on the streets of Paris. There are the sounds of explosions, a combination of flash bangs that are being used by authorities as well as fireworks that are being used by the protesters."}
{"original": "All of this was sparked as a result of the government implementation of new taxes on fuel, gasoline and diesel, and this is the result of people in opposition. But also, it appears there is a lot more to it than just fuel taxes. Again, we'll continue to monitor the situation as you look at what is happening on the streets of Paris this morning."}
{"original": "Right now, President Trump is golfing at his Mar-a-Lago estate, spending the weekend talking to potential candidates for vacant positions in his administration. Meanwhile, a new government report says if you don't do something about climate change, thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars will be lost. Remember, the president has consistently called climate change a hoax."}
{"original": "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord. I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris."}
{"original": "I don't think it is a hoax, I think there's probably a difference, but I don't know that it is manmade. I will say this. I don't want to give trillions and trillions of dollars, I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs, I don't want to be put at a disadvantage."}
{"original": "I have a strong opinion. I want great climate. (END VIDEO CLIP)"}
{"original": "PAUL: President Trump hasn't responded to the assessment yet of this newest report, but some members of Congress have. Senator Angus King tweeted in part, We're staring a threat in the face. Now is not the time for denials, excuses, or equivocation. Now is the time for action. Democratic strategist Kevin Cate with us, as well as CNN political commentator Scott Jennings. Gentlemen, thank you so much for being here."}
{"original": "Scott, I want to ask you, how do people reconcile this report by all of these scientists who are in the Trump administration with the president who continually denies the existence of it?"}
{"original": "[10:30:04] SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I think the president is grappling with a serious issue here, and that is how to deal with what is clearly a real thing. I mean, I don't think climate change is a hoax. The climate is changing. And then on the other end of it you are trying to figure out what actions can we take that would help counteract it, but at the same time not immediately devastate people in economic regions that are more sensitive to it than others, say in Appalachia where the coal industry is still important."}
{"original": "So that's what a U.S. president has to grapple with. That's what policymakers have to grapple with. I do think that some acknowledgment that climate change is real would be a good thing, and then we can have a real debate about how to deal with it without making too many short-term changes that would displace people out of an economy they depend on."}
{"original": "PAUL: Kevin, how hopeful are you that the potency of the report might bring some sort of legislation?"}
{"original": "KEVIN CATE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I'm not optimistic. I appreciate what Scott said because he is acknowledging climate change as a real and urgent threat. And I think what this report does is put it in terms of the pocketbook. It talks about the jobs that we'll lose. It talks about the health care that is going to be lost and the complications that are going to happen. I live in Florida. I know Scott is in Appalachia. It is affecting the coal industry there. It's affecting Florida right now. This is an urgent issue. If you go down to Miami Beach during king tide, this is an urgent issue that is costing jobs, it's costing tourism. I think if the president, if we can get him to care, maybe it's about the electoral math in 2020 and how important Florida is, because if we don't have a candidate who understands how urgent this is in Florida and throughout the country, they're not going to win Florida because this is that important."}
{"original": "PAUL: Scott, talk about that. If there aren't some Republicans getting on board with this, what is the political ramification of that?"}
{"original": "JENNINGS: Well, I think if we continue to see weather events that are portrayed as being caused by or made more extreme by climate change, that will be more on the minds of voters in 2020. Of course, any of these issues and their impact on an election really depends on if the candidates themselves make it a top priority. My suspicion is this will be a top priority in the Democratic primary for president. The real issue, of course, would be if either candidate makes it a top priority in the general election."}
{"original": "I do think it is important we look at what the United States has done over the last several years. I think sometimes these stories are portrayed as though nothing has been done. I did note that a report from Agriculture Department said that since 2004, North America's share of fossil fuel emissions has fallen 24 percent down to 17 percent, going up to 2013. So I think there has been some progress made."}
{"original": "PAUL: But without the president's support, can progress continue to be made?"}
{"original": "JENNINGS: Without the president's support, no legislation would be signed into law, if that's what you're looking for. But that doesn't mean the free market can't continue to innovate. Another core issue here is, will consumers demand more environmentally friendly technologies, will they demand more electric cars, for instance. So I think there's two ends to this. There's the government response, but then there is also will the market respond to consumers if they make it a priority in their own spending."}
{"original": "PAUL: Real quickly, switching gears here, Adam Schiff has said that he wants to investigate the president and Saudi Arabia and any business ties that are in existence there. Kevin, is this the way for Democrats to finally get what they have been looking for, the president's tax records?"}
{"original": "CATE: Well, I think it is important to get to the truth of any of this. It is certainly concerning that he is coming out, defending the Saudis in relation to what potentially may have happened there and what our intelligence community, the way that we understand it, is leaning towards. So I think it is important to get to the truth."}
{"original": "But I don't think Democrats are going to lose focus on the pocketbook issue that got them the majority, which is super important. We know that people don't like President Trump, we know we elected the National Enquirer, some that's womanizing, uses racist language, and denies truths like climate change or the crisis in health care. We know all that. We have to give people a reason to vote for something. So going down the path of why you shouldn't like President Trump, it is probably not a great strategy in the short term or the long term when it comes --"}
{"original": "PAUL: Scott, I have 10 seconds. I want to give you a chance to react to that."}
{"original": "JENNINGS: Yes, look, I expect Democrats to investigate anything and everything. I think overreach is definitely possible here with this new Democratic majority. They ought to be careful because it could back fire before the next election."}

{"original": "SAVIDGE: The NRA and doctors across the country are going head to head over gun violence, and the images being used make the point a graphic. We talk to a doctor about it next."}
{"original": "[10:39:34] SAVIDGE: Two groups you might not expect to be at odds, doctors and the National Rifle Association. We have to warn you, some of the images we're going to show you are graphic. Doctors have been posting tweets like these showing themselves covered in blood from gunshot victims. It is response to the NRA telling doctors to, quote, stay in their lane when it comes to gun violence prevention."}
{"original": "CNN's Brian Todd has the details."}
{"original": "[10:40:00] BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: In the aftermath of two deadly mass shootings, a heated political showdown between two unlikely rivals, the National Rifle Association and doctors that treat victims of gun violence. The fight stems from a recent article published by American College of Physicians, calling firearm violence, quote, a public health crisis that requires the nation's immediate attention. Doctors shared new recommendations on how physicians can help reduce gun violence, such as counseling patients on the risks of having firearms in the home."}
{"original": "But the doctors also weighed in on issues of background checks and illegal gun sales. That prompted this tweet from the NRA, quote, Someone should tell self-important anti-gun doctors to stay in their lane. The medical community seems to have consulted no one but themselves. But that broadside came just hours before the mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, California where 12 people were gunned down. Some doctors are outraged."}
{"original": "DR. JOSEPH SAKRAN, TRAUMA SURGEON, JOHNS HOPKINS HOSPITAL: For a group to simply dismiss the medical community that is on the front line of taking care of these patients is absolutely unacceptable."}
{"original": "TODD: Joseph Sakran is a trauma surgeon at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. He not only treats many gunshot wound victims, he was one."}
{"original": "SAKRAN: The bullet ruptured my windpipe right here, and then these scars are where I had the emergency surgery."}
{"original": "TODD: In 1994 when he was just 17, Sakran was at a high school football game when a fight broke out and someone started shooting. He ended up with a paralyzed vocal cord. After the NRA tweet, Sakran responded, quote, I cannot believe the audacity of the NRA."}
{"original": "SAKRAN: Where is the NRA when I have to tell those loved ones their family member died and is not coming back."}
{"original": "TODD: Sakran's tweet was followed by an avalanche of others from fellow doctors, slamming the NRA. One, accompanied by an x-ray, says, quote, I helped save a gun violence victim in med school. Those are my hands holding pressure on his femoral artery. The bullet is right by my fingertips. This is me in my lane, NRA."}
{"original": "Recent accounts from weapons experts on the guns used in high profile shootings have intensified the political debate. CBS's 60 Minutes recently profiled the effects of bullets fired from an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, one of the guns used in the synagogue shooting, compared to a standard handgun bullet fired on a gelatin target, simulating soft tissue. The AR-15 bullet is much more devastating."}
{"original": "That's one of many complaints from doctors, that it is harder and harder to save the lives of people hit with high power ammunition. The NRA refused to do an on camera interview with us, but the NRA is pushing back hard, telling CNN those doctors attacking the group are pushing a gun control agenda that wouldn't prevent those shootings."}
{"original": "When the NRA says you guys weighing in on policy issues like background checks really isn't in your lane, don't they have a point?"}
{"original": "SAKRAN: We have both the possibility and the responsibility to weigh in on this issue that we're having to deal with on a daily basis."}
{"original": "TODD: But the NRA's pushback also includes several tweets from doctors who support the NRA's position. One physician saying that the anti-gun doctors who write some of the articles are not practicing medicine in the trenches. One retired physician saying that he is appalled by the leftist direction that organized medicine has taken."}
{"original": "PAUL: Dr. Amy Goldberg is with us now. She's a trauma surgeon at Temple University hospital. Dr. Goldberg, thank you so much for being with us. Just for our viewers, so they understand here, I wanted to show the interesting response that you had on Twitter to what we heard from the NRA when they were telling people to stay in their lane, doctors to stay in their lane. You said When doctors make recommendations about salt intake, no one accuses us of being anti- sodium, no one tells us to stay in our lane. Seeking to reduce bullet intake doesn't make us anti-gun, it makes us pro-health. If you could sit with somebody from the NRA today, what would you want them to understand about what your intentions are here?"}
{"original": "DR. AMY GOLDBERG, TRAUMA SURGEON, TEMPLE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL: I think it is important for everybody to recognize that what the doctors want is to increase the health of our society. Gun violence is a public health crisis. Just like physicians may deal with high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol, and lung cancer, and heart disease, physicians are taking this on because this is what our patients and our families are seeing. And we feel it is an obligation to care for all of these patients and to do what we can to address this issue. PAUL: Help us understand what it is like for you to see gunshot"}
{"original": "victims again and again and again on a daily basis."}
{"original": "GOLDBERG: These wounds are devastating. The wounds that we're seeing now are much more devastating than wounds that we saw 10 and 20 years ago."}
{"original": "[10:45:04] I have been a trauma surgeon in north Philadelphia for about 25 years, and the types of guns that we're seeing, these high velocity guns with these bullets are just destroying the organs as the bullets pass through them. And I think that trauma surgeons, emergency medicine physicians, and all doctors are doing whatever they can to try to stop sanitizing these injuries."}
{"original": "PAUL: The Annals of Internal Medicine suggests new ways for doctors to reduce gun violence, regularly asking your patients if they own a gun, counseling patients on gun safety. Do you do that, and are people receptive to that?"}
{"original": "GOLDBERG: Absolutely. We surely do that at our hospital. Our trauma outreach coordinator, Scott Charles, has gun locks, and he will ask our patients and patients' families no questions asked, if you have a gun at home, it is so important you keep it safe. And the hospital has supported us passing out gun locks for free to our patients and their families."}
{"original": "PAUL: You said in an interview prior that Sandy Hook could have been a teachable moment. Why do you think it wasn't for some people in this country?"}
{"original": "GOLDBERG: I made that comment about Sandy Hook just because of the terribleness of young elementary school kids being shot, and the fact that none of them made it to the hospital, which told me as a trauma surgeon how devastating those wounds were. And as I said, I sometimes believe that what America season their TVs is really a sanitized version. The pictures that we see are the Facebook pictures of the victims. And instead I think there was a teachable moment, not being disrespectful at all, but we had a teachable moment to show what those guns and what the gun did to all those kids. And we should have had a moment to show those autopsy photos if the parents had given their permission. I think this would have made a huge change in the debate we have now."}

{"original": "JULIEN UHLIG, CEO, ENTRADE: The initial vision that we had was to build a powerplant that's truly mobile, that can convert all of the waste and turn it into clean energy on sight."}
{"original": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: ENTRADE's powerplants can fit entirely inside a 20 foot shipping container and mainly run on biomass, anything from manure to discarded lumber to yard trimmings, and even peanut shells can do the trick."}
{"original": "UHLIG: We crush it, we dry it, and then we pelletize it."}
{"original": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: These biomass pellets are what ENTRADE power units run on. By taking plastic that would otherwise end up in landfills and combining it with other green waste, they claim their units can produce enough electricity to power homes and factories."}
{"original": "UHLIG: And then put it into our reactor, and it only stays there a few seconds before it totally converts into a natural gas replacement."}
{"original": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Their newest unit a mini powerplant about the size of a frig."}
{"original": "UHLIG: We were always thinking of this power unit you can bring to middle of nowhere. Use all the waste you find around and pelletize it, and you have a complete power supply on sight."}
{"original": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But are these mini unit as easy to use as they seem?"}
{"original": "UHLIG: If you look at bags of pellets that we produce, you need two to three bags per a day. So you can actually fill it by hand in the morning."}
{"original": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's a lot of pellets. ENTRADE's off the grid vision is still in its testing phase. The company hopes that mini powerplants like these could change the ways cities and towns source their electricity, making them self-sustaining, and in some cases cleaner."}

{"original": "SAVIDGE: There is much more news ahead in the next hour of Newsroom right after this quick break. Have a wonderful day."}
{"original": "(CNN) President Donald Trump is stoking division in the Republican ranks days before control of the Senate -- and the balance of power in Washington -- is decided in a pair of runoff elections in Georgia."}
{"original": "After more than four years of nearly unbroken fealty to the President, a heavy majority of Senate Republicans broke with Trump in a Friday vote overriding his veto of a bipartisan defense policy bill. With that loyalty test failed, Trump is also lashing out at Republicans who are refusing to get on board with a dead-end attempt to throw out the election results and erase his loss to President-elect Joe Biden when Congress counts the electoral votes next week."}
{"original": "Over the last 24 hours, Trump has called for a primary challenge to the second-ranking Senate Republican, South Dakota's John Thune, praised GOP Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley for his plan to join House Republican members in objecting to the Electoral College count -- a symbolic gesture that will not stop Biden from being sworn in on January 20 -- and touted a protest in Washington scheduled for the day his defeat will be ceremonially rubber-stamped by Congress."}
{"original": "On Saturday, nearly a dozen Republican senators and senators-elect said they would vote against counting the electoral votes next week. The Republican lawmakers said they intend to reject the Electoral College votes from multiple states until an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states is completed. The group includes Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Steve Daines of Montana, John Kennedy of Louisiana, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, and Mike Braun of Indiana, and Sens.-elect Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Roger Marshall of Kansas, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama."}
{"original": "Trump's last-gasp swirl of petulant threats against lawmakers from his own party are playing out against the backdrop of a pair of tight Senate contests in Georgia, where Republicans could lose their Senate majority if Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler are swept by Democrats Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock, respectively, on Tuesday. The Republican incumbents, who both voted for the defense bill initially, were absent from Friday's vote -- Perdue in quarantine after being exposed to Covid-19 and Loeffler sticking to the campaign trail."}
{"original": "The Georgia races will be the first meaningful temperature check of the Republican base since Election Day and it comes in a traditionally red state that, through a combination of GOP discomfort with the President and supercharged Democratic enthusiasm, flipped to Biden as he clinched a comprehensive national victory. Whether the GOP can bring together angry Trump supporters, who have followed him down a rabbit hole of baseless election fraud conspiracies, and more buttoned-down, business-friendly Republicans could also set the tone for Trump's post-presidency -- and decide how much sway he carries with him as he leaves the White House."}
{"original": "For now, though, Trump is dead-set on keeping a party that has indulged him, enabled him and been enabled by him at every pass onside for one more battle. The results of those efforts, though, have been uneven. The decision to dash his veto of this year's National Defense Authorization Act, which Trump opposed because it didn't strike legal protections for social media companies and included a provision to rename military bases named after Confederate leaders, marked the first time during Trump's presidency that Republicans openly and materially rejected his desires."}
{"original": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also blocked a vote on legislation, demanded by Trump, that would increase the size of stimulus to checks to many Americans from $600 to $2,000. In one of a string of Friday tweets, the President -- bunkered in the White House after returning before New Year's Eve from Mar-a-Lago -- blasted GOP senators for defying him."}
{"original": "Our Republican Senate just missed the opportunity to get rid of Section 230, which gives unlimited power to Big Tech companies. Pathetic!!!, Trump blared. Now they want to give people ravaged by the China Virus $600, rather than the $2000 which they so desperately need. Not fair, or smart!"}
{"original": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rubbed salt in the wound in a statement after the Senate vote. Her chamber, too, had, with Republican support, overridden Trump's veto."}
{"original": "The full United States Congress, with these sweeping and overwhelmingly bipartisan votes, has delivered a resounding rebuke to President Trump's reckless assault on America's military and national security, the California Democrat said. In three weeks, our country will inaugurate a President who respects our military, protects our security and honors the will of the Congress. Until then, the Congress urges Trump to end his desperate and dangerous sabotage."}
{"original": "Trump is ramping up his push for Republicans to hijack Congress' Electoral College confirmation duty and use it as a last stand against the will of the people. He has commitments from Hawley, the Missouri Republican, and the expected backing of as many as 140 GOP House members to join the charade, which will have one immediate meaningful outcome: forcing GOP lawmakers to go on the record with a vote for or against Trump's shambolic coup attempt."}
{"original": "That, it appears, is the elusive bridge too far for McConnell. Having mined Trump's presidency for years as he installed conservative judges -- including three to the Supreme Court -- and passing massive corporate tax cuts, the majority leader is not on board this time around. Looking ahead to the 2022 midterms and the next general election two years later, he knows his members' actions could be used against them, no matter what direction they go, in future campaigns."}
{"original": "In a call with Republican senators this week, the Kentucky Republican described it as the most consequential vote of his career, and he has urged his conference to stand down and refuse to join their House colleagues in denying the results. But Hawley, who didn't dial-in, had already broke ranks with leadership and said on Wednesday he planned to object."}
{"original": "Trump retweeted Hawley's statement on Friday and layered it with a promise to -- on January 6 -- reveal massive amounts of evidence to support fraud claims that have been tossed out of dozens of courts around the country and dismissed by Republican state lawmakers and nonpartisan election officials."}
{"original": "Before Hawley's decision, Thune -- the Senate majority whip -- had played down rumors anyone from his conference would join the electoral college challenge, telling reporters a couple weeks ago any attempt would go down like a shot dog."}
{"original": "I just don't think it makes a lot of sense, he added then, to put everybody through this when you know what the ultimate outcome is going to be."}
{"original": "But Thune might have just been a bit too colorful for his own good. His comments grabbed Trump's attention and on Friday the President called on a loyalist, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, to challenge Thune in a 2022 GOP primary. (She has previously said she wasn't interested in running against Thune, a position her spokesman confirmed late Friday to The Argus Leader .)"}
{"original": "Meanwhile, fissures in the Senate GOP are opening up as the prospect of a vote becomes more real."}
{"original": "Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski defended Thune and called it dispiriting that Trump was working to pit Republican against Republican. She also expressed frustration that the President was complicating life for Republicans who had stood by him throughout his term."}
{"original": "I think it's quite interesting that he has demanded a loyalty test from so many Republicans and then when they are loyal to him -- and there is one incident, one statement -- and he is the first one to throw those loyal individuals under the bus, Murkowski told CNN. That's not loyalty as I know loyalty, added the Alaska Republican, who's no stranger to internecine contests, having been defeated in a 2010 GOP primary only to win another term in a write-in campaign that year."}
{"original": "It is, however, precisely how Trump understands the concept -- as a one-way street, with fidelity to him a requirement demanding precisely nothing in return. For his part, Thune on Friday shrugged off Trump's tweet, asking reporters as he left the Capitol, What took him so long?"}
{"original": "In a lengthy Wednesday night Facebook post, another Republican senator, Nebraska's Ben Sasse , called out Hawley -- though not by name -- over his plans to contest Trump's loss."}
{"original": "Let's be clear what is happening here: We have a bunch of ambitious politicians who think there's a quick way to tap into the president's populist base without doing any real, long-term damage, Sasse wrote. But they're wrong -- and this issue is bigger than anyone's personal ambitions. Adults don't point a loaded gun at the heart of legitimate self-government."}
{"original": "Hawley and his allies will be yielding something more like a leaky water pistol, but their actions combined with Trump's rhetoric, doomed though they all are to fail, represent a cynical ploy for short-term personal gain at the expense of further damaging the already tattered social fabric underlying American democracy."}
{"original": "Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, one of the few Republicans in Washington who has occasionally broken from Trump, expressed concern on Friday about the stunt."}
{"original": "It continues to spread the false rumor that somehow the election was stolen, Romney said. Spreading this kind of rumor about our election system not working is dangerous for democracy here and abroad."}
{"original": "Retiring Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander and West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, who was reelected in 2020, on Friday made public their disagreement with Hawley. But fellow Republican Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana said he was yet to decide whether to join him, despite suggesting that doing so would effectively amount to a protest vote. Braun's current term comes up in four years and the complications seeded by a potential vote are surely weighing on him."}
{"original": "Even Vice President Mike Pence, who has been on vacation and mostly out of sight, has quietly sought to extract himself from the mess, despite the best attempts of Arizona Republicans and one House Republican to make him its centerpiece."}
{"original": "Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert and the Arizona group filed a lawsuit effectively asking that Pence be empowered to toss out the electoral college results. Under the law, the vice president's role is largely -- as Gohmert's Friday brief puts it, rather accurately -- to play emcee to a perfunctory coronation of the next president."}
{"original": "But Pence appeared to want no part in the pantomime, a fact that might have prompted a rare Trumpian rebuke against the vice president, who has for years labored -- often exploring the boundaries of neutral language -- to stay in lock-step with the President, had a federal judge not tossed it on Friday night . (He said Gohmert and the Arizona slate didn't have the standing to file it.)"}
{"original": "Justice Department lawyers, on Pence's behalf, had trashed the maneuver, writing that a suit to establish that the Vice President has discretion over the count, filed against the Vice President, is a walking legal contradiction."}
{"original": "Pence has not himself spoken out about the process, or what role he might or might not seek to play, but in the meantime he is headed down to Georgia -- remember Georgia? -- on Monday to stump for Perdue and Loeffler."}
{"original": "Trump will be there, too, but a few hours away, campaigning in a county he won by 40 percentage points."}
{"original": "(CNN) Republican leaders on Capitol Hill are fearful that the conservative hardliner Kris Kobach could cost them a crucial Senate seat in Kansas and potentially their narrow majority -- and are eager to find a way to defeat him in a hotly contested primary."}
{"original": "But Kobach is getting face time with President Donald Trump and consulting with Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, over an immigration plan that the White House is developing. And no one knows how Trump will insert himself into the GOP primary, and whether Senate Republican leaders will succeed in getting him to endorse a candidate they argue has a better chance of winning in November."}
{"original": "In late January, Kobach dropped by the White House and met with Kushner -- and also had a private meeting with Trump and a senior White House aide where they discussed the Senate race. The President was encouraging at the January 27 meeting, according to a Kobach spokesperson, even though the Kansas conservative did not ask for an endorsement."}
{"original": "It's likely that the Senate candidate who will do the best is the one who can best articulate Trump's position and is most associated with Trump in his positions, Kobach, an immigration firebrand and voter-fraud crusader, told CNN. And the person who best fits that bill would be me."}
{"original": "Kobach's candidacy has unnerved GOP leaders, who worry that his sharply conservative positions, particularly on immigration, are bound to turn off middle-of-the-road Republicans, as they did when he lost the 2018 gubernatorial race to Democrat Laura Kelly . Senior GOP officials tell CNN that their two biggest problems currently in holding their Senate majority are in Georgia, where a messy battle between two Republicans could benefit the Democrats there, and in the increasingly complicated Kansas Senate race."}
{"original": "Indiana Sen. Todd Young, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told CNN that GOP voters in Kansas are looking for someone who is a good fit for the state and can actually win a general election."}
{"original": "Asked if he thinks Kobach can win a general election, Young said: All I have to answer that question is recent history -- the gubernatorial race, which he lost."}
{"original": "Senate GOP officials meet with Kansas businessman"}
{"original": "Behind the scenes, GOP leaders are eagerly looking for an alternative to Kobach. After failing to convince Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to run for the seat, they have been assessing the current field of candidates -- and looking at a potential new one."}
{"original": "Privately, the National Republican Senatorial Committee recently met with Bob Hamilton, a father of 12 who owns a plumbing company in Overland Park, Kansas, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the session. A source familiar with Hamilton's thinking said he is seriously weighing whether to run in the race."}
{"original": "Bob Hamilton is what people are buying right now - a conservative businessman outsider, the source said, adding that a decision could be made well before the June filing deadline for the August primary."}
{"original": "Yet there are concerns that the entry of Hamilton into the race will only bolster Kobach's chances, especially in a crowded field that also includes Rep. Roger Marshall, who was first elected in 2016 after defeating an incumbent congressman, Tim Huelskamp, a favorite of the Tea Party who had drawn the ire of business and agricultural groups. Some of those wounds from that fight are still raw, GOP sources said. And at least one conservative group, the Club for Growth, is vowing to drop big bucks in a bid to stop Marshall."}
{"original": "Marshall, an obstetrician-gynecologist, represents the same solidly Republican, farm-focused district from which former Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, Sen. Jerry Moran and the retiring Sen. Pat Roberts built the base of their power."}
{"original": "Kris tends to be a polarizing candidate, Roberts, whose retirement opened up the fight for his seat, told CNN. He does get a lot of support -- he has a strong base. He just ran for governor last time; I think there's a general feeling that he could have done much better. But we'll see."}
{"original": "Kobach rejects the notion that his Senate race would be a repeat of the 2018 contest for governor, noting that while Democrats have long been competitive for state races, they haven't won a Senate race since 1932. He says that while Kelly attacked him over funding for public schools, for instance, the issue set will be different during this presidential election cycle."}
{"original": "Marshall's camp argues that the more candidates in the race only serves to benefit Kobach, given that state Senate President Susan Wagle and former Kansas City Chiefs player and businessman Dave Lindstrom are also running in the party's primary."}
{"original": "That's his only path to victory — is this thing getting more and more crowded, said Brent Robertson, Marshall's chief strategist, referring to Kobach. If he gets Roger Marshall one-on-one, he's absolute toast."}
{"original": "Last year, Marshall's campaign held $1.9 million on hand, the most of any candidate in the race. But state Sen. Barbara Bollier, a former Republican running for the Democratic nomination, raised an astounding $1.1 million in the last three months of 2019, crushing the competition that financial quarter. Kobach had less than $200,000 on hand at the end of 2019."}
{"original": "Senate Democratic leaders are closely engaged with the race. On a private conference call with donors on Friday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer pointed to a poll showing Kobach ahead, noting he could be the nominee, according to a source briefed on the call."}
{"original": "President Donald Trump waves after speaking alongside then-Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach during the first meeting of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House in Washington, DC, in July 2017."}
{"original": "But Trump could have the ultimate say in pushing a candidate over the finishing line -- and what he decides to do remains the ultimate wildcard. Since Pompeo's decision became clear, Trump has been going back and forth about making an endorsement in the Kansas Senate race, but at this stage does not appear to be close to making one, people familiar with his thinking said."}
{"original": "Trump is closely watching polls in the state and has heard from multiple people that Kobach could threaten Republican control of the seat. Some of his advisers have gently pressed him to endorse Marshall. But he has signaled he's not ready to decide yet."}
{"original": "Still, the Republican candidates are presenting their cases to him. Trump met with Marshall a couple weeks before he met Kobach, on January 13, but spoke with Kobach on that day, sources said. Trump actually tried to phone Kobach from the Oval Office when he was meeting with Marshall, but the call went to voicemail and they connected later. Both meetings also included members of Trump's political team."}
{"original": "On January 23, Trump tweeted out a poll from a pro-Marshall Super PAC showing the race neck-and-neck between the two, with a third of GOP voters still undecided. Trump noted , Close race in Kansas!"}
{"original": "Besides touting the most money, Marshall's camp also boasts its staunch support of Trump. In response to Kobach's claim that he was more closely linked to the President, Robertson, the Marshall adviser, replied, Facts are more important than talk, arguing Marshall votes with Trump nearly 100% of the time."}
{"original": "Democrats are hoping to take advantage of the GOP infighting in 2020, building off their success two years ago."}
{"original": "Democrats won races across the state in 2018, an indictment not only of Kobach but also of Trump and the legacy of former Republican Gov. Sam Brownback, whose unprecedented tax cuts led to a budget shortfall worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Democrats didn't just flip the governor's residence, they also broke the state's entirely Republican congressional delegation, winning one of four Kansas House seats and coming close in another conservative district."}
{"original": "Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, the chairwoman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said Democrats absolutely can win in Kansas this year. Asked about the prospects of Kobach as the GOP nominee, she said: There are stark differences between the conservative candidate and Bollier."}
{"original": "And so I think it will be for purposes of people in Kansas, they're going to vote for the individual who listens to them and supports the issues that matter to them, she told CNN."}

{"original": "PHOTO: Courtesy 12 Cups Badr Aljalajel opened his coffee shop 12 Cups in 2016."}
{"original": "The shop is manned by five male Saudi baristas and some expats. Aljalajel now plans to open a second shop, this time staffed by female baristas."}
{"original": "Women who sent us their applications know that they will deal with men at work, says Aljalajel. Those who have an issue with that will become the black sheep."}
{"original": "The laws have been trending in this direction for years. In 2011, a law was passed that all shops selling women-related products, such as lingerie, should only have female sales representatives. In 2016, drug stores and optics shops could request permits to hire Saudi women, too, so long as the female staff remained separate from male workers and customers."}
{"original": "PHOTO: FAYEZ NURELDINE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Gender mixing is becoming more common. Some Saudi stadiums have recently opened their doors to women."}
{"original": "The Saudi Vision 2030 strategy, set by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, aims to increase female participation in the workforce from 22% now to 30% in all sectors in 2030."}
{"original": "There are now 600,000 Saudi women working for the private sector, 30,000 of whom joined the market last September and October, says Khaled Abalkhail, a spokesman for the Ministry of Labor and Social Development. This figure stood at 90,000 Saudi women only back in 2011."}
{"original": "It is not just Saudi women who are joining the private sector workplace – more men are, too."}
{"original": "With the unemployment rate in the kingdom at 12.8%, according to official government figures, the Crown Prince in 2016 unveiled an ambitious set of reforms that include creating private sector jobs for thousands of Saudis with the goal of lowering the jobless rate to 7% by 2030."}
{"original": "PHOTO: Courtesy 12 Cups Aljalajel wants to open a second coffee shop, in one of Riyadh's business-oriented quarters, where he plans to hire female baristas to serve men and women."}
{"original": "When I joined university around 10 years ago, I asked my father for permission to get a part-time job as a barista for $530 per month, says Aljalajel. He felt it was socially embarrassing to have his son serving coffee, and offered instead to pay me the same amount of money as a monthly allowance in return (for me) focusing on my studies."}
{"original": "The resistance wasn't just on the part of potential employees' families. For a long time, Saudi nationals were not an attractive option to employers who could hire expats often willing to work six days a week for a fraction of the salary that a Saudi employee requests."}
{"original": "For example, a Saudi working as a full-time barista at 12 Cups makes about $1,600 per month, says Aljalajel. A full-time expat barista at the same shop takes home $533 per month."}
{"original": "The average monthly wage per Saudi stands at $2,670, according to Saudi's General Authority for Statistics."}
{"original": "In 2017, in an attempt to deter companies from hiring expats, the government imposed a monthly tax on each non-Saudi employee. Companies now pay as much as $107 for each foreign employee, with that levy set to rise each year."}
{"original": "While more Saudi women are entering the private sector, the challenge is persuading them to stay there."}
{"original": "From our experience, four out of 10 women leave the jobs that we secure for them a few months after joining because their families' asked them to, says Redwan Aljelwah, who in 2016 founded Riyadh-based recruitment consultancy, Mada, which operates in the retail, F&B, and IT sectors."}
{"original": "Furthermore, Aljelwah says that demand for female employees remains much lower than for males. The unemployment rate for Saudi women in the third quarter of 2016, the most recent figures available, was 34.5%"}

{"original": "All sectors are open to Saudi women, provided that they secure them a safe working environment, says Abalkhail. He added that the Ministry of Labor and Social Development runs courses to teach Saudi women soft and hard professional skills to help them find jobs."}
{"original": "When women work, they are no longer looked upon as burdens that their families have to bear until they get married. adds Aljalajel, They have the option to become independent."}
{"original": "Ghazwan and her team of baristas agree."}

{"original": "If you have kids you know you're on the hook for their spending, at least for a while. What you might not know is that you're also on the hook for their financial education, too."}
{"original": "With only 21% of parents regularly talking about money with their kids and only 10% interested in teaching them about managing credit cards or investing, according to a study from the money app BusyKid, it looks like parents need some help."}
{"original": "We are trying to teach kids about something that they very rarely see: money, says Gregg Murset, founder of BusyKid. Gone are the days you pull out a wad of cash. We swipe, tap, and it is all invisible and kids don't get it because they don't even see it."}
{"original": "His advises parents to take the old-fashioned piggy-banks and throw them away. He argues parents need to meet kids where they are today: online."}
{"original": "Here are three new apps that can help your kids -- and you -- learn how to earn, spend and save better."}
{"original": "BusyKid, a money app for kids aged 5 to 15 and their parents, aims to streamline the allowance process into a consistent and concrete experience for kids and a learning opportunity for parents to show kids how to earn, save, spend and share their money."}
{"original": "Here's how it works: Kids track their chores or household goals on the app. One day each week the system tallies the work and allowance for that work is pulled from the parent's bank account and deposited in your kid's account."}
{"original": "It's your kids' first job with direct deposit, says Gregg Murset, a financial planner who founded the app."}
{"original": "The money is then allocated into three categories: spending (that money can be transferred to a Visa card), saving (kids can save it in cash or buy fractional shares of stock) and sharing (this money goes toward the causes and charities of their choice)."}
{"original": "When a child wants to buy fractional shares of stocks on BusyKid, the app uses a stock app called Stockpile to issue the shares."}
{"original": "BusyKid has a subscription fee of $14.95 a year (no matter if you have one kid or, like Murset, six kids). Each refillable Visa spending card is also $5."}
{"original": "Invest in a kid in your life"}
{"original": "Stash, the digital investing app, has just launched custodial accounts. These brokerage accounts allow an adult to contribute money for a child under 18, by investing in stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other securities."}
{"original": "To the relief of parents' wallets everywhere, you don't have to be the kid's mom or dad to open a custodial account. The Cool Uncle's and Doting Auntie's money is welcome here — and may make for a better present than another piece of plastic."}
{"original": "Custodial accounts serve a lot of purposes, including sharing your values of investing money and educating kids on how its done, but the most important thing is that you and the child are talking about money, says Brandon Krieg, co-founder and CEO of Stash. It's a huge problem. This discussion isn't happening at home or school any more and we want to help drive the discussion."}
{"original": "The fees are similar to the standard Stash Invest: for balances of $5,000 or less, your first custodial account will cost $1 per month and additional custodial accounts will cost half as much — only $1 every two months. All custodial accounts with balances over $5,000 will cost 0.25% per year of assets."}
{"original": "And there are some tax implications. Unlike a 529 college savings plan, this is not a tax-deferred account. The first $1,050 of income, or capital gains, from the account is not taxed annually. After that, it's taxed at the child's rate. Any amount over $2,100 may be taxed at the custodian's higher individual income tax rate, according to the IRS."}
{"original": "While this money is meant help set kids up for life later — whether it is paying for college, starting a business or investing in a house — the custodial account does count as an asset for the child and can impact financial aid decisions."}

{"original": "GoHenry is a money app for kids aged 6 to 18 and their parents that was originally launched in the UK in 2012. The company is preparing for a spring launch in the US."}
{"original": "Children work on tasks or chores they've established with their parents and are paid for them from a parent-funded wallet account on the site. The child can then set savings goals, or put it on a Mastercard debit card, with limits available on where and how much can be spent. Parents and kids both get real time notifications of what is being spent."}
{"original": "If I'm out with my 8-year-old I can change the debate from her, 'Can I have? Can I have?' to 'How much do you have on your card? What are your options?' says Dean Brauer, a co-founder of GoHenry."}
{"original": "The app will have a subscription-based fee that is yet to be determined. (But GoHenry is offering free lifetime accounts to 1,000 of their earliest participants.)"}

{"original": "San Francisco (CNN Business) In the run-up to the Consumer Electronics Show last year, Gina Muoio was pulling 60-to-80-hour weeks at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas."}
{"original": "Muoio worked as an event coordinator for a third-party electrical vendor and carefully choreographed the power needs for exhibitors, presenters and attendees at trade shows held in the massive hall."}
{"original": "There are very long days, and you're on your feet the entire time, said Muoio, 39. Sometimes you don't even have time to eat."}
{"original": "During a typical January, the presence of CES in and around Las Vegas is unmistakable. Hotel prices skyrocket, restaurants and clubs are packed, and workers like Muoio log extra hours to ensure everything goes on without a hitch for the major money-making show and related events. Last year, the 170,000 CES attendees were estimated to have generated $169 million in direct spending and a broader economic impact of $291.2 million, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority."}
{"original": "During this atypical January, however, that flurry of activity, that money and that work is gone. CES 2021 is an all-digital affair"}

{"original": "The job market in Las Vegas has been the hardest-hit among large US metro areas during the pandemic. The region is heavily reliant upon travel, discretionary spending, business conferences and large gatherings, but has seen those key spigots turned off."}
{"original": "In April 2020, shutdowns resulted in a 34% unemployment rate in Las Vegas. Although it's improved since then, Las Vegas still has the highest unemployment rate among large metro areas, according to US Bureau of Labor Statistics data."}
{"original": "As of November 2020, Las Vegas metro area's unemployment rate was 11.5%, and 128,000 people — including Muoio — remained out of work."}
{"original": "After being furloughed in March, Muoio was permanently laid off in August."}
{"original": "Since then, she says she's applied to hundreds of jobs — including stay-at-home event coordinating roles and positions in customer service or marketing — but has yet to land anything permanent."}
{"original": "Living without health insurance and awaiting a state unemployment benefit application that's been pending since August, Muoio said she's fortunate she had some money saved for an eventual down-payment on a house."}
{"original": "That money is slowly, slowly dripping down, she said. I'm running out."}
{"original": "Brandon Geyer is facing a similar situation. He's been out of work since March."}
{"original": "Brandon Geyer, a bartender in Las Vegas, said he's been unemployed since March."}
{"original": "Come March, when this first happened, I was under the impression we were going to be shut down for a couple of weeks, no big deal, he said. Another week goes by, and another week goes by, and all of a sudden, I haven't gone back to work since March."}
{"original": "For nearly 24 years, Geyer, 49, had tended bar at the Main Street Station, a downtown Las Vegas casino, brewery and hotel that remains temporarily shuttered due to the pandemic. And while the crowds got bigger whenever CES came to town, Main Street Station attracted a loyal clientele, many of whom Geyer got to know well through the years."}
{"original": "Geyer said he's grateful to be receiving unemployment benefits, that his wife still has her job, and that they had some money in savings to support themselves and their two kids. The Culinary Workers Union Local 226 has also helped procure weekly food assistance and groceries."}
{"original": "Another week goes by, and another week goes by, and all of a sudden, I haven't gone back to work since March. Brandon Geyer, bartender"}
{"original": "But the loss of full and steady income is taking its toll, Geyer said. He's hopeful that his union's push for Clark County, Nevada, to adopt a Right to Return policy will be put in place, requiring employers to offer laid-off workers the right to return to their old jobs when businesses reopen."}
{"original": "We're just wondering when we're going to return to work, he said."}
{"original": "The Boyd Gaming-owned Main Street Station is expected to reopen sometime in 2021, CEO Keith Smith said during the company's most-recent earnings call in October."}
{"original": "This time last year, optimism was high that 2020 — and CES 2021 — would be quite prosperous for Las Vegas, said Steve Hill, the chief executive officer of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority."}

{"original": "The Las Vegas Convention Center underwent a nearly $1 billion expansion, and CES 2021 was slated to be the first event held in its newly-constructed West Hall. Instead, the event is all-digital due to the pandemic."}
{"original": "Instead, the new 1.4 million-square-foot West Hall sits eerily empty, Hill said."}
{"original": "Hotels that had charged more than $400 per night for rooms during the week of CES 2020 have advertised rates in the $25 to $45 range this year, according to Hotels.com data tracked by the Las Vegas Review-Journal . Some hotels including the Mirage and Encore at Wynn have even shuttered rooms midweek because of low demand."}

{"original": "While leisure travel is expected to fuel the travel and tourism recovery, those trips aren't expected to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2022, Adam Sacks, Tourism Economics president said during a US Travel Association webinar in December. It will likely take until 2024 or later for business and corporate travel to fully return, he said."}
{"original": "For cities such as Las Vegas to see meaningful economic improvement, people will have to feel comfortable traveling again, being indoors again, and willing to spend money, said John Restrepo, principal of Las Vegas-based RCG Economics."}
{"original": "And until vaccinations are widespread all bets are off, Restrepo said."}
{"original": "Nevada's lack of industry diversification likely will hinder the jobs recovery much like it did after the Great Recession, he said. Following the 2008 downturn, it took nine years for the state to surpass its pre-recession jobs numbers"}
{"original": "This time around, Restrepo predicts it will take at least three years for the state to achieve the consistent annual rates of growth seen in major economic indicators before the pandemic hit. It will take even longer, he said, to get back to the actual levels of jobs, sales taxes, gaming revenues and conventioneers."}
{"original": "It's going to be a long slog out of this rut here in southern Nevada, he said."}
{"original": "Cyber thieves have succeeded in stealing sensitive tax and salary information on employees at a dozen companies that use the payroll giant ADP."}
{"original": "On Tuesday, ADP (ADP) explained how fraudsters managed to siphon W-2 tax forms using a convenient online feature."}
{"original": "The incident seems small in scope. But it shows how fraudsters have adopted novel techniques to steal personal information -- especially the kind that can later be used to claim tax refunds."}
{"original": "ADP didn't say when the theft occurred, and wouldn't tell CNNMoney how many people had their detailed income data exposed. But it noted the incident affected around a dozen of the company's 630,000 corporate clients."}
{"original": "One of them is US Bank, (USB) where 1,400 people were affected. That's about 2% of the company, according to the bank."}
{"original": "Here's how it happened, according to ADP. Many companies provide pay information to their employees online. This makes it easier to download past W-2 forms whenever they're needed for doing taxes or applying for a loan."}
{"original": "ADP offers this to their corporate clients via a public-facing website. To register, an employee has to use a unique company registration code and some personal information, such as a Social Security number and birthday."}
{"original": "Related: Security experts say Bangladesh bank heist gang could strike again"}
{"original": "US Bank, for example, told CNNMoney it published its special ADP link on a public website meant for bank employees."}
{"original": "Criminals took advantage of the fact that employees at some companies hadn't yet signed up for the service. They managed to get a hold of some company registration codes, then paired that with stolen employee personal information."}
{"original": "The combination of an unsecured company registration code and stolen personal information enabled the fraudulent access to the portal, ADP told CNNMoney in a statement."}
{"original": "ADP said there's no evidence its own computers have been hacked, and seemed to blame clients for not properly guarding keys to its document-sharing feature."}
{"original": "Related: DA says Apple is crippling investigations"}
{"original": "Publishing unique registration codes to an unsecure website is not common practice. ADP actively advises against this practice, notifies clients of the potential risks, and has temporarily disabled access to the registration portal for those clients that continue to publish company registration codes in this fashion, it said."}
{"original": "ADP acknowledged this incident after it was revealed by cybersecurity reporter Brian Krebs and said it's working with a federal law enforcement task force to investigate what happened."}
{"original": "It's the latest example that shows how much personal information hackers have amassed on the black market -- and how it's being repurposed by identity thieves for all sorts of fraud."}
{"original": "The data leak -- which isn't quite a hack because there's no sign criminals ever broke into anything -- bears striking resemblance to an episode last year involving the IRS website."}
{"original": "In that case, an organized crime syndicate used stolen personal information to turn a convenient IRS feature into a leaky faucet."}
{"original": "The data stolen in the ADP leak makes it easier for hackers to steal tax refunds next year. All it takes to file a fake return is a person's name and Social Security number. While the IRS has improved its anti-fraud system to catch wildly erroneous returns, criminals armed with accurate salary information are more likely to pull this off."}

{"original": "As the Trump administration recalls tens of thousands of government workers to restart operations previously closed during the partial shutdown, one expert says the law allows fairly wide latitude to decide which government functions are essential."}
{"original": "On Thursday, the State Department announced that its employees would return to work in the coming days."}
{"original": "Alice Rivlin, who directed the Office of Management and Budget under the Clinton administration, said the guidelines were not particularly clear and that officials could revisit their assessments as shutdowns dragged on."}
{"original": "The law itself is pretty vague, Rivlin told CNN. It's a question of what's essential and what isn't. … In the end it's a judgment call."}
{"original": "The Antideficiency Act, which guides many of the decisions around a government shutdown, provides this broad guideline: emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property. It does specify that language cannot be used to justify ongoing, regular functions of government the suspension of which would not imminently threaten the safety of human life or the protection of property."}
{"original": "Those decisions are generally the domain of the Office of Management and Budget."}
{"original": "Our mission from the President has been to make this shutdown as painless as possible, consistent with the law, Russ Vought, the current deputy director of OMB, told reporters earlier this month."}
{"original": "He ticked off some of the administration's adjustments to make that happen, such as recalling IRS workers to process tax refunds, reversing plans to stop issuing flood insurance policies and bringing back rangers to clean up national parks."}
{"original": "In some cases, activities and performance would not qualify for continuation during a very brief funding lapse … but they would qualify if the duration of the funding lapse became longer, reads a December guide from OMB to federal agencies."}
{"original": "Rivlin, who led OMB during a 21-day shutdown that had been the longest until the current one surpassed it, said she believed it was appropriate to include flexibility in the laws and guidelines, as it allowed the administration to adapt as circumstances changed."}
{"original": "She had urged her Clinton administration colleagues to make decisions that visually reminded Americans that their government was closed, such as by cutting power to the National Christmas Tree."}
{"original": "I said I didn't think the Christmas tree was essential. That one got a lot of screams and a lot of volunteers to keep it lit and operating, she said. I thought that was unfortunate. I thought we wanted to make as clear as possible that the shutdown was inconveniencing people."}

{"original": "That works out to an average of about $1,000 for each SCE&G residential customer. Payments will depend on how much electricity SCE&G customers have used in the past year."}
{"original": "Dominion also said Wednesday that it plans an average 5% rate reduction for SCE&G customers, thanks in part to to lower corporate taxes under the new federal tax law in Washington."}
{"original": "Dominion said the rate cut would lower the average SCE&G customer's electric bill by more than $7 a month."}
{"original": "It would lock in significant and immediate savings for SCE&G customers -- including what we believe is the largest utility customer cash refund in history, said Dominion chairman and CEO Thomas F. Farrell II said in a statement."}
{"original": "The refund isn't just about tax reform, though. It's a way for Dominion to pay back SCE&G customers for money they've already spent to pay for the shutdown of two SCANA nuclear power plants."}
{"original": "Dominion said it was writing down $1.7 billion in costs tied to the closing of the two plants."}
{"original": "Related: Just a small slice of Corporate America has shared tax savings so far"}

{"original": "Farrell said Dominion will need approval from South Carolina regulators for the customer payments and rate refunds but that Dominion believes it is in the best interests of all parties to reach an agreement on this critical issue."}
{"original": "To be sure, the acquisition will clearly benefit investors, too. Shares of SCANA surged more than 22% on the news Wednesday."}

Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, or incumbent Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. Early voting wrapped this week and Election Day is Tuesday, January 5."}

{"original": "The Senate majority would determine whether measures expanding abortion access backed by the Democrat-led House and Democratic President-elect Joe Biden would meet a receptive vote or a thorny end. And on a much broader scale, whichever party takes the Senate holds the power to confirm or reject Biden's picks for the federal judiciary, a key part of determining national abortion policy as conservative state legislatures advance restrictions in hopes of overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion nationwide."}
{"original": "Anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List's partner Women Speak Out PAC is on track to exceed its projected $4.1 million campaign on the runoff, according to the group's president, Marjorie Dannenfelser. The campaign, which is slated to reach 1 million voters and make 750,000 in-person voter visits, features hand delivered absentee ballot applications as well as digital and mail ads, she said."}
{"original": "Dannenfelser credits the rise of abortion as a focal issue in the race to the candidates deciding that they're going to communicate (their stances on abortion) as part of their overall leadership, one way or the other."}
{"original": "You've got complete clarity between the two sets of candidates, and when you have complete clarity, that's a gift in politics, and it's something that can be defined -- you can mobilize a base, she said, adding that, I think in Georgia, it's a set up for this to be the same dynamic as in many other type battlegrounds that ... a reasonable abortion position puts you, gives you the edge."}
{"original": "The organization has also issued Spanish-language ads targeting 100,000 Spanish-speaking voters in Georgia, which is 9.9% Latino , according to the US Census Bureau."}
{"original": "We had not planned on that in Georgia, not necessarily foreseeing that we would be interacting with a lot of Spanish-speaking, pro-life voters, but as it turns out, we are, Dannenfelser said, adding that we want to meet people where they are. The group anticipates strong voter turnout for anti-abortion candidates among Hispanic voters and young women between the ages of 18 and 22, she said."}
{"original": "On the other side, Planned Parenthood Votes has a six-figure campaign underway, according to Alicia Stallworth, the super PAC's Georgia state director. The group has sent nearly 400,000 text messages, made hundreds of daily phone calls and is part of a coalition of progressive groups that is over 85% of the way to its goal of knocking on five million doors, Stallworth said."}

{"original": "Our ground game and our strategy is to organize to turn out voters, to try to repeat the same thing that we did in the general election, she said. She thinks that abortion has stepped into the runoff spotlight because Warnock is a pastor and we are in the South, so it's that outdated belief that he cannot be a minister and support women's reproductive rights."}
{"original": "While both Loeffler and Perdue have pressed their opponents on their stances on abortion -- asserting in a co-authored op-ed that Ossoff and Warnock are planning on legalizing late-term abortion, sending your tax dollars to fund abortions -- Warnock has garnered much of the attention on the issue."}
{"original": "Some conservative politicians have accused Warnock, who was born and raised in Savannah and has served as the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta for 15 years, of misleading voters regarding his identity and failing to represent the state's views."}
{"original": "You see this Warnock fella who's coming down here and disguising himself as some moderate pastor from the South who doesn't believe in these radical ideas, North Carolina Rep.-elect Madison Cawthorn told Fox News in mid-December. Cawthorn asserted that Warnock says he's a pastor, yet he's all about abortion. This is somebody who does not represent what real Americans believe."}
{"original": "Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin asked a Georgia rally crowd in December, Is this a representation of the Democrats' heart in Georgia, to have a pro-abortion pastor who's running? She said that it's all the more reason why we have those in the Senate, especially those representing Georgia, who understand the sanctity of life."}
{"original": "Loeffler highlighted her divisions with Warnock over abortion during the only televised debate in the Senate runoffs, beginning her argument, Look, I'm not going to be lectured by someone who uses the Bible to justify abortion."}
{"original": "Listen, Warnock said as part of a broader response to the attack. I have a profound reverence for life and an abiding respect for choice. The question is, whose decision is it. And I happen to think that a patient's room is too small a place for a woman, her doctor and the US government -- I think that's too many people in the room."}
{"original": "Warnock has stood by his stance on the issue, tweeting , I am a pro-choice pastor and I will always fight for reproductive justice. A former sexual health educator , Warnock sent an email to supporters last month highlighting Loeffler's vote to confirm conservative Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett and accusing Loeffler of attacking me for my unequivocal belief in a woman's right to choose."}
{"original": "A divisive issue has a history in the state"}
{"original": "Georgia has historically taken a conservative stance on abortion, with Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signing a heartbeat bill in 2019 banning abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy that was blocked in court in July 2020."}
{"original": "But Biden won the state in the presidential election by less than 12,000 votes , marking the first time in 28 years that a Democrat won Georgia. The Democratic ticket's historic success was fueled by a grassroots organizing renaissance that rallied a rapidly diversifying electorate and suburbs that are, at once, growing and becoming increasingly inhospitable to Republican candidates."}
{"original": "Polling on abortion in Georgia suggests that the issue is narrowly divided. According to CNN exit polling from Election Day, 52% of Georgia voters thought that abortion should be legal, while 43% thought it should be illegal. Those numbers also vary based on race -- among White Georgia voters , 43% thought abortion should be legal while 53% thought it should be illegal, and among Black Georgia voters , 69% thought abortion should be legal while 24% thought it should be illegal."}
{"original": "Planned Parenthood Action Fund President Alexis McGill Johnson, who appeared at a Get Out the Vote event with former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams , told CNN that Abrams, whose group Fair Fight aims to help Democratic candidates by increasing voter turnout, and other partners in the state have been laying the groundwork for understanding sort of where progressive voters are in Georgia, and that it is a numbers game and a turnout game."}
{"original": "Particularly in the middle of a pandemic, the opportunity to talk about health care, to talk about the impact that not having access to basic health care, including access to abortion, or limitations on that, really resonates with people, McGill Johnson said, adding that I definitely feel as though this is a winnable race because of the climate that we're in."}
{"original": "Outcome in Georgia has national ramifications"}
{"original": "The implications of who wins the challenges and thus the Senate could be swift. Biden backs repealing the Hyde Amendment, a provision in congressional funding bills since 1976 that currently bars federal funds from going toward abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is at risk. Biden's position comes after making a dramatic shift during the Democratic primaries from his long-held support for the provision."}
{"original": "And despite the current Republican-controlled Senate, Democrats in both chambers have signaled interest on various provisions expanding abortion access. Disagreements over Hyde were one of the sticking points in negotiations over the massive government spending bill for the new fiscal year, and House Democrats hosted a hearing last month, expressing hope of repealing Hyde. In the Senate, a markup of a funding bill was abruptly canceled in late 2019 after Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington requested a vote on her amendment reversing the Title X abortion referral rule that bars participating providers from referring patients for abortions, according to a Democratic aide."}
{"original": "None of this is lost on Kristan Hawkins, the president of Students for Life Action, an anti-abortion group bringing over 200 students to Georgia with the goal of knocking on 70,000 doors and directly texting voters in a campaign costing at least $280,000."}
{"original": "To Hawkins, abortion has emerged as a key issue in the Georgia runoff because the Supreme Court in 1973 handed down Roe v. Wade, which she characterized as hanging by a thread in light of the multiple legal cases in the pipeline for the conservative-majority court to consider."}
{"original": "She pointed to the significance of Supreme Court picks as well as the multiple venues where the battle over abortion access is playing out. We're calling it the 'Save the Senate' campaign because it's literally going to determine whether or not we can hold back taxpayer-funded abortion on demand and all nine months, Hawkins said, referring to efforts to repeal the Hyde Amendment, whether or not we can ensure that, you know, the Democrats do not try to pack the US Supreme court."}
{"original": "Stallworth sees what's riding on the runoff as similarly critical."}
{"original": "Honestly, I think everything is at stake in these two Senate seats, she said. Especially when we're talking about the fact that the two senators who we need to be elected will hold, will basically hold the fate of the nation in their hands when we know that women's reproductive rights are constantly being attacked."}

{"original": "(CNN) Polls show more and more Americans are saying they will get the Covid-19 vaccine when it's their turn. That's good news. But skepticism, conspiracy theories and misinformation are still rampant, making it unclear just how much longer we'll be living amidst a viral pandemic and all that comes with it. This week, I talk to Dr. Kent Sepkowitz, a physician at Memorial Sloan Kettering, and Tom Nichols, author of Our Own Worst Enemy, to find out what comes next for America and the vaccine. But first, Sepkowitz writes our CNN op-ed. - SE Cupp"}
{"original": "Last month, the US introduced a pair of new vaccines that were developed using a novel scientific technique to stop the spread of a deadly virus. The goal is to vaccinate as many people as are willing, as soon as possible. This is all while the nation is changing presidents and trying to save a reeling economy."}
{"original": "In other words, we are in the midst of rolling out a completely unprecedented national program with no promise that things will work out as intended."}
{"original": "The first weeks of the vaccine rollout have drawn intense criticism from politicians, including President-elect Joe Biden, scientists and countless others who seem to have expected smoothly choreographed execution from production labs, transport truckers, supply chain workers and hundreds of clinics and millions of recipients."}
{"original": "Their unrealistic expectation makes some sense. After all, scientists had just pulled a once-in-a-century sort of rabbit from their hat, producing a seemingly first-rate pair of vaccines in record time with, up to now, very little evidence of concerning side effects. After doing the impossible once, many assumed that a second longshot would hit the mark as well and a flawless vaccine implementation program would magically appear."}
{"original": "Wishful thinking. Instead, we have a plodding, mediocre program in place despite the neglect of the Trump administration, which has extended its take no responsibility attitude to include a refusal to develop any semblance of a coordinated federal vaccine effort."}
{"original": "Which brings us to January 20 and the incoming Biden administration, full of plans and programs. Though this is assuring for many, they should expect strong political disagreement on many issues as officials try to vaccinate at warp speed."}
{"original": "First, Biden has made clear that he believes in deliberate active governing rather than vague Darwinian market forces to optimize public programs. He already a Covid-19 response team led by capable experienced people whose job will be to organize and make decisions and do the many boring behind-the-scenes tasks of government. These are people at desks, on the phone, in meetings -- people with unmemorable faces and no political axes to grind."}
{"original": "Here come the bureaucrats. Lots of them. They will build an ambitious but imperfect plan and become easy fodder for the (re-invigorated) Republican song of small government."}
{"original": "Next, Biden et al. are believers in science, in the exact process -- fund the scientists and get out of their way -- that led to 2020's great vaccine miracle. But don't think that will help them win hearts and minds. Not everyone believes in the vaccine or even the virus itself."}
{"original": "As the Covid-19 vaccine story has evolved, medical historians have recalled the polio vaccine campaign of 1955 that led to elimination of the disease in the US decades later. It is important to remember that, in the decades it took to produce the Salk and then Sabin vaccines, many children were killed or crippled along the way."}
{"original": "Despite the missteps, the polio vaccine program was embraced by most of the public, perhaps owing to the poignancy of a disease that could permanently harm children as well as a greater trust in both science and government in the decade after World War II concluded."}
{"original": "In contrast, the public attitude towards Covid-19 and the vaccine splits across political lines. Even the brutal fact that it has killed more than 1.8 million people globally, including 350,000 in the US, has failed to sway some. We continue to have inconsistent acceptance of basic public health measures, as if the recommendations were an assault on free choice, a capitulation to a bunch of whimpering scientists with their fake news graphs and charts."}
{"original": "Finally, the poorly understood concept of herd immunity is likely to cause serious dispute among citizens, given that it focuses on the well-being of the community and not the individual. The idea of herd immunity was developed a century ago by veterinary researchers interested in livestock. They and others created a statistical model to estimate how many people (or animals) in a community must be immune (by vaccine or natural infection) to make it very unlikely for a non-immune person to become infected."}
{"original": "Viewed a different way, the premise of herd immunity (better referred to, in my opinion, as community immunity) is this: we want to vaccinate you to help you, sure, but mostly to protect that guy over there whom you have never met and with whom you might disagree about everything, who has decided not to get the vaccine. If we all pull together as a group, it makes life better for everyone!"}
{"original": "This message of communitarianism is at odds with much of the current political discourse. And the e pluribus unum angle is likely to sharpen as we learn just how many people will decline the vaccine. As of early December, just over a quarter of the population were hesitant to take the vaccine, according the Kaiser Family Foundation. This group represents veteran anti-vaxxers, some additional Trump stalwarts determined to stare the infection down, others who already had the infection and think enough is enough, and of course some who believe the baseless conspiracy theory that Bill Gates wants to place a microchip into their bodies."}
{"original": "No matter how they arrived at their refusenik stance, if this group is large enough, it may prevent herd immunity, which experts estimate would require immunity from 70-85% of the population to achieve. That would precipitate discussions of mandatory vaccination, which, in turn, would inflame those already determined to avoid vaccination, threatening the entire national campaign and exacerbating a giant national argument about the role of government in daily health and safety."}

{"original": "Personally, I doubt it will hit a boiling point -- if indeed more than half of the country is vaccinated and many additional people already are immune, at least for a while, from natural infection, we likely will see good, though not great, control of the Covid-19 pandemic."}
{"original": "This would mean that, rather than a runaway pandemic, we would see occasional small and moderate-sized outbreaks here and there, similar to what we see with measles whooping cough and other vaccine-preventable infections almost every year. It's terrible and tragic and unnecessary -- but it's not on the same scale as the current historic pandemic."}
{"original": "Indeed, it is likely that by this time next year, we will be back to fighting tooth and nail about tax cuts and Middle East policy and reproductive rights. Which I suppose is some version of good news."}
{"original": "Final presidential push starts in Texas for Bush and Gore In this story:"}
{"original": "AUSTIN, Texas -- Both the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees chose Texas on Sunday to be the launch pad for their final campaign efforts in the remaining 16 days of the race for the White House. The Republican nominee, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, was in Austin to launch his Brainstorm for Reform tour with 28 other GOP governors. Vice President Al Gore, his Democratic rival, was in Dallas to begin a two-pronged endgame of wooing undecided voters and getting his backers to the polls. Meanwhile, the latest CNN/USA Today/Gallup tracking poll shows Bush is the current preference of 50 percent of likely voters, while Gore is the current preference of 41 percent. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. Interviews with 700 likely voters were conducted from October 19 to 21. While the poll shows Bush maintaining a solid lead over Gore among likely voters, there is plenty of time left in which events can shift voters' current preferences. Nine states, 160 electoral votes I can't think of a better way to kick off the last two weeks of this campaign than stand up with my colleagues, encourage them to go out and invigorate the grass-roots organizations that we have in place all across the country, Bush said in Austin. The Republican governors have scheduled 45 stops in 25 states through Wednesday. Bush will visit nine states this week which carry a total of 160 electoral votes."}
{"original": "He will team up with four governors on Monday in Midwestern states where he hopes to make inroads. Bush will campaign in Kansas City, Missouri; Des Moines, Iowa; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, and prominent Republican women including McCain's wife Cindy, and Lynne Cheney, wife of GOP vice-presidential nominee Dick Cheney, also will make a campaign appearance with Bush. Gore appears at church dedication Gore chose the dedication of a new 8,000-seat sanctuary at Potter's House church, the ministry of the Rev. T.D. Jakes in Dallas, Texas, to attack Hollywood's toxic entertainment. The vice president said there was too much explicit sexuality aimed at families at times when young children are watching. This is a problem that must be addressed, he said. Both with explicit sexuality and with violence, there are those who say it is not a problem -- it doesn't affect people. Well, it does. Gore's Sunday schedule also included stops in Albuquerque, New Mexico, for dedication of the National Hispanic Cultural Center of New Mexico, and Portland State University in Oregon. 'Kitchen table' campaign Aides said Gore would make a series of major speeches on key issues in the last 16 days -- starting with Sunday's speech on his families agenda -- and meet individual families around the country in a kitchen table campaign. His organization also plans to mobilize thousands of volunteers for what they said would be an unprecedented effort to get out the vote."}
{"original": "Gore campaign manager Donna Brazile said, I told the strategists and advertising people several months ago that if they get us within the margin of difference ... we could pull it off on the ground. You can make up five, six points on the ground in the final weeks of the campaign. Brazile said the campaign was also redeploying up to 3,000 volunteers from safe states to battleground states to help turn out Gore voters at the polls. Newspapers make their picks Meanwhile, third-party candidates touted the importance of their role in U.S. politics. Natural Law Party candidate John Hagelin said on NBC's Meet The Press, Third parties in America have always done the most important things. All of the important innovations came from third parties. The right of women to vote, abolition of slavery, child labor laws, a balanced budget: These ideas and most others came from third party candidates. Libertarian Party candidate Harry Browne said on the same program that voting Republican or Democratic means you're giving up. You're saying I'll never be free, I'm never going to have a smaller government. I'm going to pay income tax for the rest of my life. I'm going to pay Social Security for the rest of my life. So I'm just going to vote for whoever will take me to hell at the slowest possible rate, he said. Newspapers on Sunday began lining up behind the candidates, with The Washington Post, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, The (Minneapolis) Star-Tribune and The San Francisco Chronicle endorsing Gore."}
{"original": "Bush received backing from The (Portland) Oregonian, The Seattle Times, The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer, The Columbus (Ohio) Dispatch, The Detroit News and The Dallas Morning News. Focus shifts to Electoral College With the national race so close, attention is moving to the state-by-state contest to win the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency. One estimate by veteran political analyst Hal Bruno for the Politics.com Internet site gave Bush 213 electoral votes and Gore 186, with 139 votes up for grabs and too close to call. But individual state polls in the Midwest appeared to indicate that Gore's position was weakening in the toughest battleground of the nation. An Illinois poll, for example, showed him leading on Sunday by just 45 percent to 43 percent, well within the poll's margin of error. Last month, the vice president led by a double-digit figure in that state. Reuters contributed to this report."}
{"original": "If you're ever rolling through Philadelphia's City Center along the Market-Frankford SEPTA line, hop off and hit up Freddie 4th-and-26 Mitchell. He just might buy you a beer. But don't expect the co-author of one of the most memorable playoff moments in Eagles history to wax poetic about his former team or his rocky four-year tenure with Philly's beloved NFL football franchise."}
{"original": "You can see me in Fishtown at a dive bar having a beer with people, Mitchell, 40, told Bleacher Report. You won't see no other former players like that. Because I love people."}
{"original": "Mitchell does indeed love people. Philadelphia people in particular. And Eagles fans, of course. Why else would the Lakeland, Florida, native and UCLA product remain in the city 14 years after his time with the Eagles abruptly ended?"}
{"original": "Editor's note: This is the first installment in B/R's Where Are They Now? series, which profiles some former NFL postseason greats, their historic moments and what they're doing now."}
{"original": "Video Play Button Videos you might like"}
{"original": "His loyalty has nothing to do with the organization. Because while Mitchell loves those who love the Eagles, he has no love for the franchise itself, its owner and several of his most notable former co-workers."}
{"original": "So if you ever have that beer with Mitchell, I promise he'll be happy to talk your ear off about 4th-and-26—the play that explains almost entirely why the former wide receiver continues to own real estate both in Pennsylvania and in the hearts of many Eagles fans who otherwise might have long forgotten the No. 25 overall pick of the 2001 draft."}
{"original": "Just don't ask him about his former quarterback, Donovan McNabb, his former head coach, Andy Reid, or longtime Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie—not if you're hoping for a jubilant trip down memory lane, anyway."}
{"original": "Mitchell says McNabb wanted me to fail, and he at least partly blames the six-time Pro Bowler for the fact that he never landed a second NFL contract."}
{"original": "He holds bitter feelings for Reid, noting that while he was a father figure to me in the beginning, I was just [neglected], and Donovan was the guy."}
{"original": "And he's still dismayed at Lurie, who Mitchell says won't give him the time of day, he believes, because of his checkered post-NFL past, which contains several brushes with the law and a 37-month stint in federal prison as a result of a tax-fraud conviction."}
{"original": "Mitchell is convinced his circumstances would be vastly different if he had more early-career support in Philadelphia and/or if he didn't suffer so many head injuries while playing football. He considers himself disabled, noting that his wife, Patty, has basically become his caretaker. He says he has early-onset dementia and serious depression, and says he has seizures, insomnia and memory loss. He believes there's a link between his history with concussions and the naivety and myopia that may have contributed to his legal problems."}
{"original": "I'm not going to say concussions made me [commit] fraud or whatever else, he said. I'm saying the concussions and everything made me naive to getting taken advantage of and to seeing something like that. I had trust issues—I trusted everybody. And I live with [the repercussions of] that every day."}
{"original": "But before Mitchell started feeling this way, before he went to prison, before he endured (and eventually won) a tumultuous custody battle over his now-15-year-old daughter, before his relationship with the Eagles turned sour and before he was held to a single 11-yard catch on four targets in Super Bowl XXXIX (which would turn out to be the last game of his NFL career), there was 4th-and-26."}
{"original": "It came at about 7:45 p.m. ET on Jan. 11, 2004—15 years ago Friday. At Pro Football Reference, it's just another line among the play-by-play, no wider or taller than the others."}
{"original": "Donovan McNabb pass complete to Freddie Mitchell for 28 yards (tackle by Marques Anderson)."}
{"original": "Those unfamiliar with the play can probably deduce that Mitchell caught a 28-yard pass from McNabb and that it happened on a fourth-down snap in which Philadelphia needed to travel a distance of more than a quarter of the field."}
{"original": "What you also must know is said throw and catch took place on the Eagles' final gasp of a divisional playoff game against the Green Bay Packers."}
{"original": "Trailing by three points with one timeout left and 1:12 remaining in the fourth quarter, on the final play of a set of downs that at that point contained two incomplete passes and a 16-yard sack of McNabb, Mitchell—who was wrapping up his third pro season at age 25—ran a deep slant route from the right slot into a Green Bay secondary that was playing Cover 2."}
{"original": "He found a soft spot just short of the line to gain, leaped above Packers defensive back Bhawoh Jue, caught a well-placed but wobbling football, juggled said football and then secured the reception as he came down and took immediate hits from Anderson and Darren Sharper."}
{"original": "Officially, his forward progress and a generous spot resulted in a 28-yard gain for a first down."}
{"original": "Before that, I saw that the defensive coordinator was going into a prevent defense and leaving holes, said Mitchell, who at that point had yet to catch a pass in the game. So I let Andy Reid know."}
{"original": "Why not point that out to the quarterback?"}
{"original": "Oh, Mitchell said of McNabb, he wouldn't listen to me at all."}
{"original": "So while on the sideline earlier on that drive, Mitchell says he called wide receivers coach David Culley in the press box."}
{"original": "This is what you need to run, and it's wide open, Mitchell recalls saying. Just let me find the hole."}
{"original": "Apparently, the coaching staff did exactly that."}
{"original": "Andy is sometimes receptive of what you're seeing, he said, because sometimes on the field you're seeing more than anybody, and you know what's going on. So he was receptive to that, and he called a play where I could work my magic. And FredEx delivered."}
{"original": "Fox game analyst Cris Collinsworth was instantly critical of Green Bay's defensive approach, which left too much space in the middle of the field and included unnecessary coverage underneath. Mitchell was barely disturbed by an early-route bump and then had far more room than you'd expect 15-plus yards into his route."}
{"original": "I was like, Man, I know I can beat this guy and reach this hole, he recalled. I was reading the defense, and I really knew what was going on."}
{"original": "Mitchell caught a nine-yard pass from McNabb on the next play, and about a minute later, David Akers kicked the game-tying field goal. A baffling Brett Favre overtime interception and a short Philly scoring drive later, and the Eagles had improbably defeated a bitter rival and moved one step closer to the franchise's first Super Bowl victory."}
{"original": "That's why this particular fourth-down conversion has its own Wikipedia page—even though that championship quest ended just one week later in a 14-3 NFC title-game loss to the Carolina Panthers."}
{"original": "Following the March 2004 addition of Hall of Fame wide receiver Terrell Owens, the Eagles and Mitchell would get to the Super Bowl in February 2005. It was during that run that he famously thanked his own hands for being so great. But with Owens on board, Mitchell's numbers declined. And after insulting and possibly inspiring Philly's impending Super Bowl opponent, the New England Patriots, by pretending not to know the names of any of the team's defensive backs, he struggled in a Super Bowl loss to New England."}
{"original": "I felt used, he said of his Super Bowl XXXIX experience. I felt like at times when Donovan didn't perform, I was a scapegoat from the receiver group."}
{"original": "That spring, as Mitchell held out and asked to be traded during organized team activities, the Eagles used an early-second-round pick on wide receiver Reggie Brown. They released Mitchell two weeks later, with one season remaining on a five-year, $5.5 million rookie contract. He'd work out for more than half a dozen pro teams over the next three years, but he never played in another game. And half a decade after his last workout, he was behind bars."}
{"original": "It was a very humbling experience, Mitchell said of his time in prison. It had its great moments, and it had its bad moments. Being away from family is horrible, but it just sucks because you would think, Hey, if he would have been treated the way he should have been treated and utilized the way he should have been utilized, would he have ever done that? Would he have ever been in prison?"}
{"original": "It's a fair hypothetical question for Mitchell to ask, but it's also fair to wonder if he's taking enough responsibility."}
{"original": "After all, Mitchell pleaded guilty to playing a role in a serious tax-fraud scheme in which he and two accomplices conspired to file a false tax return in the name of former NBA player Drew Gooden."}
{"original": "But he said in our conversation he was wrongly sentenced."}
{"original": "When asked to clarify that in a follow-up email, Mitchell said he was railroaded into taking a plea deal I didn't deserve for a crime which I was far less responsible for than the government alleged."}
{"original": "The federal government has a great record at getting convictions, he added, because they make going to trial nearly impossible. Threatening huge sentences and massive court costs to scare people into accepting the terrible deals they offer is a strategy they use to great effect, and it worked on me. I felt forced into taking their deal, even though I didn't feel I was guilty of the crime they accused me of, because I couldn't afford to drain my savings from the NFL and have my family live in poverty while I sat in jail."}
{"original": "That's a common occurrence in the American judicial system. Less common is a defendant arguing at a sentencing hearing that head injuries caused mental disabilities that led him to defraud the government. But it's no coincidence that Mitchell's new life is dedicated to those fields."}
{"original": "Mitchell wants to write a book detailing his many ups and downs, but he's deeply interested in prison reform and wants to pursue endeavors that would allow him to advocate in that area. Meanwhile, his primary goal is to establish a mental-health clinic and foundation."}
{"original": "My perception of the NFL is that it was an education, he said, and I learned from it. I learned not everyone is looking out for you, and you have to basically look out for yourself. I forgot that lesson, and going to prison really reinforced it. But it's made me realize how important it is to be there for others."}
{"original": "Mitchell's mental health issues provide his motivation to help others with theirs, but those same issues are also holding him up."}
{"original": "It's not good, he said point-blank when asked about his quality of life. I'm raising a child, and I get extreme migraines, so I deal with my disability every day."}
{"original": "He says his bad days outweigh his good days, and that he spends much of those days seeking and practicing holistic methods to alleviate his symptoms."}
{"original": "It hasn't been easy on Patty or his daughter, either."}
{"original": "She's very young, and she would love to live her life, he said of his wife, but we can't because of my disability. So it's sad, but we just try to maintain a stable, quality life while we can."}
{"original": "Knowing all of this in hindsight, does he regret playing football?"}
{"original": "I don't regret anything, he said, because I understand that I had to make that sacrifice to get out of where I was at [financially]. To try to better my family and the next generation of Mitchells, I was willing to take that sacrifice."}
{"original": "But he realizes there might have been alternatives."}
{"original": "I went to UCLA, he added after reconsidering the question about regrets. I easily could have become a businessman or entrepreneur somewhere else. But not even five years after I was done with football, my brain started slowing down. A lot of things are altered when you just bang your head in since the age of five."}
{"original": "Looking back, Mitchell doesn't like to use the word bitter, but he still spends time stewing about the Eagles and life as an NFL player in general. He says he still won't cheer for Reid in his current role with the Kansas City Chiefs, pointing to the way things ended in the spring of '05."}
{"original": "It just sucks because we're expendable as athletes, he said. Coaches have to learn by going through players, but the players still have a life. It's very depressing, and it just hurts. Because I had a relationship with his son, who passed away, better than anybody around. And it just hurts that after I chose T.O. over McNabb as far as who was right in a situation, he had to go with McNabb. You live and die by your quarterback, and I was expendable—I didn't have a $100 million contract to deal with."}
{"original": "It isn't hard to pick up on the narrative Mitchell has established regarding his NFL demise. The infamous rift between Owens and McNabb was brewing just as the Eagles released Mitchell, and he and Owens were allies. It's possible Reid and the front office considered those politics when they cut Mitchell, but there's little doubt that Owens also rendered Mitchell more expendable on the field in 2004."}
{"original": "Still, he holds McNabb at least somewhat responsible for the fact that his career stalled at the four-year mark."}
{"original": "I'm a forgiving person, but if somebody can cost you about $40 million for a second contract, I don't know how forgiving you can be, Mitchell said. I feel like I sacrificed so much to get that big second contract, and he screwed me. It just sucks. And that's how the game goes. And that's my livelihood. This only lasts so long. So the only thing I ended up with is the concussions and the migraines and the disabilities I have now. That's all I have to show for it. That's it."}
{"original": "But Mitchell's broader frustration—and particularly his resentment for Reid—appears to regard the system itself, which is evident when he touches on that expendable nature of being a non-star player. Mitchell views the NFL as basically legalized prostitution."}
{"original": "Any time it's a third-down situation or fourth-down situation, then they needed me, he said. Now they want me. So it's just humorous to me because I had to self-promote myself because I was just not getting any love, only because Donovan McNabb wanted all the attention."}
{"original": "I felt used pretty much the whole time, he concluded, because my talents weren't utilized the way I thought they should have been."}
{"original": "Through representatives, both McNabb and Reid declined to comment for this story."}
{"original": "In Mitchell's mind, the Eagles—who also opted not to comment—had an opportunity to redeem their relationship with the star of one of their most memorable plays after Mitchell was released from prison in 2017. It's at that point that a former prisoner returned to his former home and went to his former employer in search of support."}
{"original": "He says he showed up at the team facility on his first day back in Philly, figuring he could lay the foundation for a new chapter in his life. He had a story to tell, having gone from a humble upbringing to 4th-and-26 to the Super Bowl to being in the hole, as he calls it, and having dealt with the debilitating symptoms of concussions along the way."}
{"original": "There's no better spokesperson than me, he said. I learned how to lose. That's what made me so strong."}
{"original": "And that might have made him a firm presence in the community, but he says the team wasn't interested."}
{"original": "Why do you hate me like this? he remembers thinking. What did I do to you?"}
{"original": "Mitchell says he told the team he'd make appearances for free to let people know I'm in the community, but he says he still hasn't received a call from the organization."}
{"original": "All they care about is who can make them money and who can win them ballgames, he added. Which it's a business; I get that. But it still hurts to see somebody that you sacrificed for—you go and try to get help from them, and there's just no movement. It's nothing to them to find me a position so I can get back on my feet. It's nothing. But, no. None of that happened."}
{"original": "While behind bars, Mitchell says he assumed he'd be embraced by a team that in 2009 signed Michael Vick three weeks after the quarterback was released from home confinement following a prison stint. He was wrong, and he was further perturbed when, in September, Lurie hosted popular local hip-hop artist Meek Mill—who was out on bail from a sentence related to a parole violation—at the team's home opener."}
{"original": "Altogether, Mitchell says it caused him to fall back into a deep depression."}
{"original": "It's funny that Jeffrey Lurie was out there with Meek Mill, paying him hundreds of thousands of dollars [to appear or perform at team events], and he's in the owner's box and he's balling and stuff after he got out of prison, he said. Jeffrey Lurie and the organization loved him. And yet a player that sacrificed his well-being, his life, his everything for them—they never gave me any opportunities. I couldn't even get invited to make a $500 appearance."}
{"original": "According to a source with knowledge of Mill's dealings with the team, the Eagles compensated Mill for at least one performance at a team-related event, but there's no indication of how much they paid the rapper. Regardless, Mitchell doesn't hold ill will toward Mill for any compensation he may have received from the organization."}
{"original": "In fact, Mitchell is a big supporter of Mill's. His music motivated me while I was in prison, he said. And his poetry gets me through life every single day, but to see the Eagles sticking up for his injustices but not mine, it hurt."}
{"original": "He's under the impression this is a common occurrence, and that professional sports teams frequently leave former players in the dust when they feel they don't have anything positive to offer the organization. But by all accounts the Eagles have strong relationships with the vast majority of their alumni, many of whom are omnipresent at games, practices, camps and team-run events."}
{"original": "I've had nothing but positive experiences going back, said former Eagles linebacker and active alumnus Garry Cobb. I don't show up for like every practice or anything, but I do feel very welcome."}
{"original": "Former Eagles offensive tackle Jon Runyan, who serves as vice president of the Philadelphia chapter of the National Football League Alumni Association, notes that alumni involvement is a two-way street that requires frequent communication from both team and former player. And the reality is that middle-aged retired players like Mitchell are less likely to consistently engage, at least compared to older retirees like the 61-year-old Cobb."}
{"original": "If you actually look at the guys that come to the events, they're the older guys, said Runyan, who was teammates with Mitchell throughout the wide receiver's pro career. They're the guys that are old enough to be my dad."}
{"original": "Everybody feels like they're an outcast, Runyan said of his experiences with generally younger retired players, and yet they don't want to invest the time to be a part of the process."}
{"original": "Additionally, most former players, regardless of age, left the team on better terms than Mitchell did—Reid said in April 2005 that Mitchell was absent from a minicamp practice because the head coach did not want him here. Others also maintained strong relationships with the franchise and community, while Mitchell makes no secret of his resentment toward a franchise he feels betrayed by."}
{"original": "Could that lack of relationship explain why Mitchell believes the team hasn't properly celebrated 4th-and-26?"}
{"original": "It's not as though the Eagles pretend the play didn't happen. The team's official Twitter account did post video of 4th-and-26 on last year's anniversary of that game, and it is included as part of a video montage of great moments in Eagles history that airs on the Lincoln Financial Field video boards at home games—but on their social media, Mitchell notes, you wouldn't even know that Freddie Mitchell existed."}
{"original": "The franchise's Twitter account has sent over 47,900 tweets since 2010, but only one of those posts has mentioned Mitchell by name. For what it's worth, only three tweets from the Eagles have mentioned Owens. But a lot of players from that era who put up numbers similar to Mitchell's—James Thrash, Todd Pinkston and L.J. Smith, to name a few—have also hardly been mentioned."}
{"original": "Mitchell's lack of social media love wouldn't be out of the ordinary if not for the fact that none of those other guys were involved in such a historic play. A 2017 NBC Sports Philadelphia poll indicated 4th-and-26 was the second-best play in team history, behind only 2010's Miracle at the Meadowlands. And it is routinely ranked highly on lists of memorable NFL moments."}
{"original": "That's why Mitchell considers the lack of attention odd, but for many, the play remains indelible."}
{"original": "As much as the big machine wants to pump up all the other plays or every other thing that's happened in Philadelphia history, he says, people know about 4th-and-26."}
{"original": "He says strangers recognize him and give him kudos for the play on almost a daily basis, and that was also the case when he was incarcerated. He moved penitentiaries on several occasions during his sentence, and he says being the guy behind 4th-and-26 always earned him attention and respect. He's seen 4th-and-26 tattoos, which he's been sure to share on his uber-active social media accounts, and he frequently catches praise from Packers fans."}
{"original": "The organization [contributed to] my depression by trying to suppress 4th-and-26 and my existence in the community, he said, but Eagles fans helped [ease] my depression with their appreciation of 4th-and-26."}
{"original": "Google Trends indicates the term 4th-and-26 continues to be searched consistently, usually spiking every year around playoff time. And just last month, Mitchell received a large reception at a Philadelphia 76ers game."}
{"original": "That play has really just kept me—I hate to say relevant because in my mind I know I'm relevant—but it just really, really has a special place in Philadelphia fans' hearts, even though they just won a Super Bowl."}
{"original": "The Philly Special is more in vogue than 4th-and-26, and Mitchell said he wondered for a while whether last year's hoopla would cause his play to get buried. But that didn't stop him from joining the fans to cheer on the team he often detests during its Super Bowl pursuit. He was on the field with the fans, jamming to Justin Timberlake during the Super Bowl LII halftime show, and he immersed himself in the crowds at the team's victory parade that week."}
{"original": "Even if 4th-and-26 has been slightly obscured by those events, the face of one of the most improbable plays in NFL history insists that those fans continue to approach him on the street to thank him for that memory."}
{"original": "A beer in Fishtown would also suffice. But maybe refrain from asking about you-know-what or you-know-who."}

{"original": "One official said to expect at least one rally a week for the rest of the year. And though much depends on his other commitments, Trump has told aides he wants to eventually return to the pace he kept during the 2016 campaign."}

{"original": "(CNN) With just one day left until President-elect Joe Biden takes office, five of his Cabinet nominees faced Senate panels as part of the first step of the confirmation process."}
{"original": "Nominees taking part in confirmation hearings on Tuesday include Janet Yellen, Biden's pick to lead the Treasury Department; Avril Haines , Biden's choice to lead the Office of the Director of National Intelligence; Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary designate for the Department of Homeland Security; Antony Blinken to lead to State Department; and Retired Gen. Lloyd Austin for Secretary of Defense."}
{"original": "The hearings' late start means that Biden is on track to take office without key Cabinet members confirmed. Still, aides have told CNN it is possible the Senate moves on Wednesday, after Biden is sworn in, to confirm some of the nominees."}
{"original": "Nominees participated in hearings across the halls of Congress on Tuesday. Here are the key takeaways."}
{"original": "Nominees emphasize keeping politics out of intelligence and diplomacy"}
{"original": "Biden's pick for director of national intelligence underscored the need to keep politics out of the US intelligence community -- an apparent attempt to turn the corner after years of tension between Trump and the intelligence community during his time in office."}
{"original": "To be effective, the DNI must never shy away from speaking truth to power -- even, especially, when doing so may be inconvenient or difficult, Haines said at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. To safeguard the integrity of our intelligence community, the DNI must insist that, when it comes to intelligence, there is simply no place for politics ever."}
{"original": "Notably, Haines, a former top CIA official and deputy national security adviser under President Barack Obama, was introduced by Dan Coats, Trump's first director of national intelligence and a former GOP senator."}
{"original": "Coats, who repeatedly clashed with Trump over Russia's interference in the 2016 election, emphasized Haines' commitment to bringing non-politicized truth to power and restoring trust and confidence in the intelligence community and the American public."}
{"original": "Blinken also said during his confirmation hearing that the State Department has to be a nonpartisan institution, breaking sharply from his predecessor Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has repeatedly engaged in political activity while serving as America's chief diplomat."}
{"original": "Yellen, Biden's nominee to head the Treasury Department, told lawmakers that if confirmed, her core focus will be on the needs of America's workers and another coronavirus aid package."}
{"original": "I will be focused from day one on providing support to America's workers and to small business, putting into effect as quickly and efficiently as I can the relief in the bill that was already passed and then, over time, working for a second package that I think we need to get through these dark times before the vaccination program enables us to go back to life as we knew it, Yellen told the Senate Finance Committee during her confirmation hearing."}
{"original": "Yellen also reaffirmed that Biden eventually wants to repeal parts of the 2017 tax cuts that benefited the highest income Americans and large companies, as well as reverse the law's incentives to offshore operations. But she added that Biden has been very clear that he does not support a complete repeal of the 2017 tax law."}
{"original": "Mayorkas says it will take time to undo Trump policies, and commits to pause in border wall construction"}
{"original": "Biden's nominee to lead the Department of Homeland Security reiterated Biden's commitment to stop further construction of the wall on the southern border of the US."}
{"original": "President-elect Biden is committed to cease funding for further construction of the border wall. I would execute President-elect Biden's commitment in adherence to the laws that guide us, Mayorkas said during the hearing. He dodged questions about whether he thinks the physical barriers along the southern border be taken down or removed."}
{"original": "That didn't satisfy Sen. John Hawley, for one, who moved to block Mayorkas' quick consideration after the hearing due to his border answer."}
{"original": "Mayorkas also said the dismantling of existing immigration policies created under Trump will take time. He also told lawmakers that he does not recommend defunding Immigration and Customs Enforcement."}
{"original": "I think President-elect Biden, and people who will be joining his incoming administration have spoken about the fact that there's a commitment to follow our asylum laws to enforce our asylum laws, and that means to provide humanitarian relief for those individuals who qualify for it onto the law, Mayorkas said. That cannot be accomplished with just the flick of a switch and turned on and day one(.)"}
{"original": "Addressing domestic terror threats and conspiracy theories"}
{"original": "Both Haines and Mayorkas addressed ongoing concerns about domestic terrorism and the spread of conspiracy theories during their hearings -- held in the halls of Congress less than two weeks after pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol building."}
{"original": "Haines said she felt concern and obviously empathy for those working in the Capitol at the time, calling the images disturbing. She also said she would work with the FBI and DHS to produce a public assessment of the threat that QAnon poses to the US."}
{"original": "Mayorkas called the threat of domestic extremism is one of the greatest challenges the Department of Homeland Security confronts, and it has unique capabilities in confronting that challenge."}
{"original": "If I should have the honor of being confirmed, I will do everything I can to ensure that the tragic loss of life, the assault on law enforcement, the desecration of the building that stands as one of the three pillars of our democracy, and the terror that you felt, your colleagues, staff and everyone present, will not happen again, Mayorkas said."}
{"original": "Later Tuesday afternoon, Retired Gen. Lloyd Austin, Biden's nominee to be Defense Secretary, pledged during his hearing to fight hard ... to rid our ranks of racists and extremists."}
{"original": "The job of the Department of Defense is to keep America safe from our enemies, Austin said. But we can't do that if some of those enemies lie within our own ranks."}
{"original": "The incoming administration's approach to China, Iran and Israel"}
{"original": "Nearly all of the nominees who participated in Tuesday's confirmation hearings previewed the Biden administration's approach to China."}
{"original": "Blinken said at his Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing Tuesday afternoon that there is no doubt that China poses the most significant challenge of any nation-state to the United States. He also bluntly said that Trump was right for taking a tougher approach to China, even though he does not agree with the Trump administration's tactics."}
{"original": "Blinken said the US had to start by approaching China from a position of strength, not weakness. Part of that strength, he said, was in working with allies and engagement with international institutions."}
{"original": "Austin said during his hearing that he saw China as a pacing challenge for the Defense Department."}
{"original": "And earlier Tuesday morning, Haines said she supports an aggressive stance to deal with China -- one that is more assertive than where we had been in the Obama-Biden administration."}
{"original": "She called China a challenge to our security, to our prosperity, to our values across a range of issues and said the intelligence community's approach to China has to evolve."}
{"original": "Yellen told lawmakers that if confirmed, she would not relax the US' approach on China, promising to take on China's abusive, unfair and illegal practices."}
{"original": "China is undercutting American companies by dumping products, erecting trade barriers, and giving away subsidies to corporations, she said."}
{"original": "Nominees also further detailed how the incoming administration expects to approach Iran."}
{"original": "Haines said that while the incoming Biden administration has indicated it would come back to the table with Iran if Tehran came back into compliance with the Iran nuclear agreement, she noted that frankly, we're a long ways from that."}
{"original": "Blinken said the incoming administration has an urgent responsibility to do whatever we can to prevent Iran from acquiring ... (a) weapon or getting close to the capacity to having the fissile material to break out on short notice, but did not offer specific steps with regard to rejoining the Iran nuclear deal."}
{"original": "And Austin said he thinks Iran's ... behavior continues to be destabilizing."}
{"original": "Blinken and Austin previewed their incoming administration's approach to Israel."}
{"original": "The secretary of state-designate told senators that the incoming administration recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and said it would leave the US Embassy in the contested holy city."}
{"original": "And both men praised the Trump administration's efforts to normalize relations between Israel and other countries in the Middle East."}
{"original": "Austin further said that he thought the recent agreements between several countries in the region to normalize relations with Israel is a good thing."}
{"original": "I think certainly this has put a bit more pressure on Iran and I hope that it will have good effects, he added."}
{"original": "Blinken said that while he applauded the Abraham Accords established during Trump's tenure in office, it presented an opportunity to create a greater sense of confidence and security in Israel as it considers its relationship with the Palestinians. Because whether we like or not, whether they like or not, it's not just going away."}
{"original": "Austin told senators he supported the incoming administration's priority to overturn Trump's ban on transgender people enlisting in the military. And Blinken said during his hearing that he will swiftly appoint an LGBTQI envoy and will allow embassies to fly the pride flag -- after the Trump administration denied multiple embassies the ability to fly the flag during pride month in 2019."}
{"original": "This is a matter, I think, of some real urgency, Blinken said of the envoy position, which was left empty under Trump. We've seen violence directed against LGBTQI people around the world increase. We've seen, I believe, the highest number of murders of transgender people, particularly women of color, that we've seen ever. And so I think the United States playing the role that it should be playing in standing up for and defending the rights of LGBTQI people is something that the department is going to take on and take on immediately."}
{"original": "Blinken also affirmed that he would repudiate the findings of the Commission on Unalienable Rights -- Pompeo's keystone initiative, which contended in its report that some rights were not worth defending. Rights groups and advocacy organizations feared it would have damaging effects on human rights abroad and the rights of women and LGBTQ people."}
{"original": "If Biden's Cabinet picks are confirmed, they will make history as the most diverse group to ever lead federal agencies. Four out of five of Biden's nominees participating in confirmation hearings on Tuesday are breaking ground in that regard."}
{"original": "If confirmed, the nominees include the first female director of national intelligence, the first female treasury secretary, the first Hispanic and first immigrant DHS chief and the first Black Pentagon chief."}
{"original": "This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday."}
{"original": "President Trump and his top advisers appear to have a new message for America: Lower your expectations."}
{"original": "Trump played up his image as a businessman and dealmaker who could rescue the U.S. economy. The day he was sworn in, he vowed to create 25 million new jobs -- the most of any president in history -- and double the growth of the Obama era (among other promises)."}
{"original": "Wall Street has roared in anticipation, with the stock market hitting new heights. Over on Main Street, small business and consumer confidence hit multi-decade highs."}
{"original": "Now, reality is setting in for how much Trump can really get done (and how fast) on the economy."}
{"original": "The big tax reform that was supposed to be done by August? Don't bet on it. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer put it this way: It still would be a great opportunity before they leave for August recess, but we're going to make sure we do this right."}
{"original": "Trump's campaign promise to greatly reduce -- or even eliminate -- America's federal debt? That was hyperbole, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told CNBC Wednesday. I'm not going to be able to pay off $20 trillion worth of debt in four years."}
{"original": "Labeling China a currency manipulator on Day One? That's not happening (not even on Day 100). They're not currency manipulators, Trump told the Wall Street Journal Wednesday in a major U-turn. During the campaign, Trump had said China has the upper hand against American manufacturers because it keep its currency artificially low."}
{"original": "Related: Americans have become lazy and it's hurting the economy"}
{"original": "Repealing Obamacare and replacing it with something something terrific? That's up in the air. His first attempt failed in March when he couldn't gin up enough votes in Congress. Many business leaders hoped Trump would move on to tax cuts, but Trump surprised many by telling Fox Business on Tuesday, I have to do healthcare first. Now, confusion abounds on what the next priority is."}
{"original": "Fixing America's disastrous trade policies? The White House has decided to study the issue. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced a 90-day comprehensive trade review at the end of March. Much of the trade war talk has been dialed back after Trump's recent meeting with Chinese President Xi."}
{"original": "Spending $1 trillion on infrastructure? That's unlikely. Mulvaney said he and top economic adviser Gary Cohn are assuming a $200 billion number."}
{"original": "The Trump train appears to be coming off the tracks as the president backpedals on a number of issues, says Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jones Trading."}
{"original": "Related: U.S. dollar drops sharply after Trump calls it 'too strong'"}
{"original": "Investors run to 'safe haven' assets again"}
{"original": "There are also his flip flops on NATO (now he's really for it), China's trade surplus (he says he'll give China more favorable trade terms if they help out on North Korea), Syria (now the White House wants regime change there) and Janet Yellen (he bashed her on the campaign trail for propping up the Obama economy. Now he says he likes her and that low interest rates are good)."}
{"original": "All this dialing back of expectations is causing a reality check in the markets."}
{"original": "U.S. stocks have stalled -- and even dipped -- since the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high on March 1. Even more telling is how investors are stocking up on safe haven assets like gold and government bonds."}
{"original": "Gold has jumped 7% in the past month, and the 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds are now yielding a mere 2.26%, a significant decline from 2.58% a month ago. The yield goes down when more people are buying bonds."}
{"original": "The key might still be tax reform"}
{"original": "Since the election, the consensus view has been that Trump would do a major tax cut/overhaul (the biggest since the 1986 reform under President Reagan), scale back regulations and spend more money on the military and infrastructure. All of this was supposed to juice the economy -- and stocks."}
{"original": "Related: Trump's mixed messages on Obamacare subsidies could prompt insurers to flee"}
{"original": "But now that thesis is breaking down. Any action on taxes probably won't happen until later this year -- or even 2018. Infrastructure and the massive budget cuts Trump wants are in doubt, and Trump's get tough foreign policy is causing some alarm that the U.S. could be headed for more war."}
{"original": "The 30 Freedom Caucus members in the House have sent a chill through the Trump inner circle. It's clear they can block much of the Trump agenda, and Democrats seem lukewarm, at best, about cooperating, says Greg Valliere, chief strategist at Horizon Investments. So Trump has to lower expectations."}
{"original": "Valliere still believes the pro-business faction of the White House, led by Goldman Sachs alum Gary Cohn, will prevail."}
{"original": "Business owners from Wall Street to Main Street would probably forget (and forgive) a lot of Trump's flip flopping and uncertainty if tax reform gets done. But all the indications are the White House and Congress are a long way from making that happen."}
{"original": "We're talking about revamping one of the most complicated tax systems in the developed world, which would understandably take time to draft and negotiate across party lines, says Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income."}

{"original": "Story highlights Dr. Bandy X Lee made it clear that she is not in a position to diagnose the President Lee said she felt compelled to speak out given comments and actions by Donald Trump"}
{"original": "A dozen lawmakers from the House and Senate received a briefing from Yale psychiatrist Dr. Bandy X. Lee on Capitol Hill in early December about President Donald Trump's fitness to be president – and Lee has been asked to speak with additional lawmakers, worried about the President's mental state, later this month."}
{"original": "Lawmakers were saying they have been very concerned about this, the President's dangerousness, the dangers that his mental instability poses on the nation, Lee told CNN in a phone interview Thursday, They know the concern is universal among Democrats, but it really depends on Republicans, they said. Some knew of Republicans that were concerned, maybe equally concerned, but whether they would act on those concerns was their worry."}
{"original": "The briefing was previously reported by Politico. Lee, confirming the December 5 and 6 meeting to CNN, said that the group was evenly mixed – with House and Senate lawmakers. And included at least one Republican – a senator, whom she would not name."}
{"original": "Lee's public comments are highly unusual given protocols from medical professional organizations – including the 37,000-member American Psychiatric Association – banning psychiatrists from diagnosing patients without a formal examination. Under recent guidance from the APA, it is fine for a psychiatrist to share their expertise about psychiatric issues in general, but member psychiatrists should not give professional opinions about the mental state of someone they have not personally evaluated, according to an APA blog post. When asked by CNN about Lee's comments, the APA referred them to this guidance."}
{"original": "Yale declined to weigh in on Lee's remarks when reached by CNN for comment."}
{"original": "Yale University does not take positions or issue statements regarding the health or medical condition of public officials. However, the University will not interfere with the free expression or academic freedom of faculty members who wish to express their opinions in their areas of expertise or otherwise, Yale spokeswoman Karen Peart said in a statement."}
{"original": "Lee made it clear that she is not in a position to diagnose the President, or any public figure, from afar. But she said that it is incumbent on medical professionals to intervene in instances where there is a danger to an individual or the public. She argues that signs the President has exhibited have risen to that level of danger."}
{"original": "CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on Lee's remarks on Trump's mental health. During the White House briefing Thursday, press secretary Sarah Sanders called questions about the President's state of mind disgraceful."}
{"original": "If he was unfit, he probably wouldn't be sitting there, wouldn't have defeated the most qualified group of candidates the Republican Party has ever seen, Sanders said, before praising Trump as an incredibly strong leader."}
{"original": "The meeting between Lee and members of Congress was set up through a former US Attorney with ties to Capitol Hill who approached Lee at the request of a number of lawmakers, she said. Lee provided them a briefing based on her book on the subject. Dr. James Gilligan – another psychiatrist – an expert on studying and predicting violence, also made a presentation."}
{"original": "Mr. Trump is showing signs of impairment that the average person could not see, Lee said. He is becoming very unstable very quickly. There is a need for neuropsychiatric evaluation that would demonstrate his capacity to serve."}
{"original": "Lee is scheduled to hold another briefing at the home of Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro later this month with lawmakers on the same topic and is also scheduled to speak at Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin's town hall in Maryland this month as well. Raskin has introduced a bill called the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity Act, which would use the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to create a body to determine whether the President is unable to execute the powers and duties of his office."}
{"original": "Raskin, who attended Lee's presentation, told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday that Trump's behavior is increasingly delusional and there should be an independent body to evaluate his fitness."}
{"original": "Of course we got big public policy crises going on right now, Raskin said on CNN's The Lead with Jake Tapper. We've got a gun violence crisis, we've got the tax bill – which was bought and paid for by the Koch brothers and the Mercers – so we got some serious stuff to deal with and instead we're caught up every day in what looks like the country debating the mental health of the president, so it's a very dangerous and unstable situation as a number of Republican senators have themselves observed."}
{"original": "No Republican has called publicly for an evaluation of the President's mental fitness."}
{"original": "Lee cited Trump's repeated referencing of conspiracy theories in his public statements as a troubling sign."}
{"original": "As he is unraveling he seems to be losing his grip on reality and reverting to conspiracy theories, she said. There are signs that he is going into attack mode when he is under stress. That means he has the potential to become impulsive and very volatile."}
{"original": "Specifically, Lee pointed to Trump's verbal aggressiveness and his boasting about sexual assault on the Access Hollywood tape that was revealed during the campaign. She accused the President of inciting violence at his rallies, and having an attraction to powerful weapons. Lee said his threats to ramp up military action and the taunting an unstable leader in North Korean Leader Kim Jung Un are all signs of the President being on the verge of a psychotic breakdown."}
{"original": "In Wednesday's White House press briefing, Sanders also dismissed a question about the President's mental health."}
{"original": "I think the President and the people of this country should be concerned about the mental fitness of the leader of North Korea, she said."}
{"original": "Lee rejected claims that her research is any way politically motivated."}
{"original": "I am uninterested in partisan politics, I have never registered for a political party, she said. Ideology doesn't interest me."}
{"original": "CNN's Aileen Graef and Jen Christensen contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Mitch Landrieu, who served as Louisiana's Lieutenant Governor from 2004 to 2010 and mayor of New Orleans from 2010 to 2018, is a CNN political commentator. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion at CNN."}
{"original": "(CNN) In any disaster, the response and recovery can only be as good as initial preparation."}
{"original": "As lieutenant governor of Louisiana, I helped lead the state through Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Ike and Gustav. As mayor of New Orleans, I helped lead the city through storms, the BP oil spill, boil-water advisories, floods, tornadoes and other major events. We prepared for Ebola and ran multiple tabletop exercises on pandemics and bioterrorism scenarios. I've been part of both good and bad responses to disasters and emergencies."}
{"original": "The coronavirus, known as Covid-19, may be unique in the way it is transmitting itself and in its relative lethality. But the fundamentals of what a solid response entails and recovery to an emergency are remarkably consistent across any level of government, whether it be a public health threat, natural disaster or other crisis."}
{"original": "Responses to emergencies require clear command and control; good and consistent communication; strong coordination and collaboration from all levels of government; and cooperation from the public."}
{"original": "It has to start at the top with our commander in chief. It is clear at this point that our federal government was not as prepared as it should have been for a pandemic of this type. And President Donald Trump's Oval Office primetime address on Wednesday night did little to convince me otherwise. But it's not too late to start communicating clearly and consistently now, with one voice."}
{"original": "When I was mayor, we would schedule at least twice daily media briefings to methodically go through hurricane preparations and response by sector and department. As much as possible, they were held at the same time each day and helped establish a battle rhythm that allowed both the media and public to stay on top of the most up to date information."}
{"original": "By establishing regular briefings, Vice President Mike Pence and his public health team have done a better job communicating as of late. But it is clear to me they were not free to speak candidly about the situation at hand by downplaying the risk and scale of the crisis. Until they do, it will be hard for the public to have the full confidence required to save lives."}
{"original": "In a situation like Covid-19 that requires a robust government response, the federal, state and local governments need to be better coordinated —both vertically and horizontally. This means talking frequently behind the scenes, breaking down silos and building partnerships. And the final c — cooperation — is a key ingredient here. A good response necessitates cooperation from the public. Self-quarantines seem hard, but they are necessary. And no matter how monotonous constantly washing your hands with soap and water may seem, remember it could save your life."}
{"original": "Some people will never trust politicians, so be sure to reach them with credible experts like public health professionals out front. I remember vividly talking to a gentleman who had just been rescued off of his roof during Katrina. I asked him why he didn't heed repeated warnings to evacuate. Without missing a beat, he said, I don't trust anything you politicians say."}
{"original": "Lack of trust is another reason why leaders and experts must be honest, transparent and project competence. For the elected officials and experts, it really is important to understand that you can't guarantee that people are not going to get hurt. What we have to do is be prepared and try to engage in reducing risk."}
{"original": "Put the poor and most vulnerable at the center of your response"}
{"original": "From Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to the BP oil spill, crises shine a bright light on the plight of our most vulnerable residents. After Katrina, retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré wrote , When it gets hot, the poor always seem to get a little hotter. When it gets cold, the poor get colder. And when it rains, the poor are going to be a little wetter."}
{"original": "Covid-19 is going to be no different. Sure, the virus doesn't discriminate based on someone's earnings. But poor people will be hit harder disproportionately — in the pocketbook, in health care access and likely in health care outcomes. Economic news right now is focused on the stock market and corporate giants in the airline and cruise industry, but the real impact will be on the working poor, including those working hourly jobs in the service and hospitality sectors, and people in the gig economy whose jobs rely on robust consumer spending."}
{"original": "No amount of payroll tax reduction is going to help someone in a minimum wage job who either cannot work because they are sick or because their job is not needed in a pandemic. Finally, vulnerable populations tend to stress the system in a crisis. Put the poor in the center of planning moving forward."}
{"original": "There are not many issues that government can solve alone. After Katrina, one of my focuses as lieutenant governor became to harness the spirit of volunteerism and philanthropy. In this crisis, there will be very few volunteer opportunities, but the government will have a role in facilitating philanthropic support where it is needed most, linking people together and leveraging assets and resources in order to accomplish specific outcomes. The government can also leverage the research and development capacity of the private sector."}
{"original": "There are also instances in the response where the government should steer, not row, to make it clear that it is acting as a facilitator with the ability to link public, private, not-for-profit, and faith organizations, and help each of them leverage their collective assets."}

{"original": "Check politics at the door: The easy thing to do after a poor early response is for the opposing political party to point fingers and assess blame. We saw the rush after Katrina to place blame either with former President George W. Bush or former Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco, depending on your political persuasion."}
{"original": "It was counterproductive, and eroded trust internally and from the public. Saying what has gone wrong is the easy part. Showing how to fix it is the most important part for us to focus on now."}
{"original": "A word of caution to my Democratic friends: this is an all hands on deck moment. Lives are at stake. Nothing levels the ideological differences like an emergency, which forces people to pull together."}
{"original": "Finally, all of us in our daily lives must prepare for the worst and hope for the best. While some public health experts have now said it's too late to contain the coronavirus, it's not too late to heed the lessons from Katrina and other disasters. I, for one, am hoping and praying they do."}

{"original": "If you don't know your status, use the IRS's filing status tool."}
{"original": "For example, if you are under 65 years old, filing as a single person and have earned $10,400 or more in gross income, you'll need to file a tax return. And if you and your spouse are both under 65 years old and are married filing jointly, you'll need to file a return if your gross income is equal to, or exceeds, $20,800."}
{"original": "What do I need to file?"}
{"original": "A hefty part of doing your taxes is pulling together all the paperwork and documentation."}
{"original": "To prepare your taxes you will need to have your personal information (Social Security number), your income (wage and any freelance work, also any Social Security or unemployment income) and receipts of other types of income (from real estate, royalties, trusts). You'll also need a copy of last year's tax return."}
{"original": "Most wage-earners have what they need, income-wise, from a W-2, which you should have received from your employer.

{"original": "Now that you're moving away from having your parents or a CPA do your taxes, you have a few DIY options."}
{"original": "If you earn less than $66,000 you are eligible for free e-file, which means you can use name-brand tax software and file for free."}
{"original": "Those earning more than that will need to pay for tax software that will allow you to e-file. Alternatively, you can prepare a paper copy of Form 1040."}
{"original": "The IRS advises that if you are owed a refund, it will arrive within three weeks of your return being received if you e-file. If you mail a paper copy of Form 1040, it may take six to eight weeks to get your refund."}
{"original": "What else do I need to know?"}
{"original": "The IRS reminds you: file only one federal income tax return for the year no matter how many jobs you had, how many W-2 forms you've received, or how many states you lived in during the year."}
{"original": "Also, file only one return per calendar year — even if you haven't gotten your refund or haven't heard from the IRS since you filed. (There may not be as much feedback as you'd like, but resist the urge to go full-blown stalker on the IRS.)"}

{"original": "In his first formal address to the nation from the Oval Office, President Donald Trump painted a picture of a national threat and humanitarian crisis occurring along the US-Mexico border, saying his signature border wall would provide a solution."}
{"original": "Here's a partial rundown of the President's statements and the context:"}
{"original": "Trump: The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico."}
{"original": "The President has made this false claim before."}
{"original": "Trump long ago abandoned his 2016 campaign promise that Mexico would pay to build a wall. Instead, he now makes the case that Mexico will indirectly pay for the barrier, thanks to the potential increase in tax revenue generated by his replacement for the North America Free Trade Agreement."}
{"original": "But the new deal hasn't yet been ratified by Congress, where Democrats have expressed opposition. And even if the new United States Mexico Canada Agreement ends up raising tax revenue, there's nothing earmarking that money for a wall. Income and corporate taxes are general revenue that would have to be appropriated by Congress."}
{"original": "Another way trade could bring money into the Treasury is through tariffs – which are paid by American importers when they buy foreign goods. But like the original NAFTA, the new deal aims to keep trade between the three countries largely tariff-free."}
{"original": "Trump: Every day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country."}
{"original": "This is overstated. Available Customs and Border Protection data shows a total of 396,579 people were apprehended by the US Border Patrol for fiscal year 2018 at the southwest border, which would mean an average of 1,087 each day – hardly the thousands that Trump purports. The numbers differ each month. The highest number of apprehensions was in September, with a daily average of nearly 1,400."}
{"original": "Apprehensions are still well below historic highs. In the early 2000s, for example, annual apprehensions routinely topped 1 million. After hitting an historic low in 2017 of around 300,000, apprehensions increased in fiscal year 2018 to nearly 400,000."}
{"original": "The President also expressed concern about what he called a growing humanitarian crisis. There's been an uptick in unaccompanied minors and families approaching the US-Mexico border, many of whom are seeking asylum. Deteriorating conditions in the Northern Triangle (Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras) are among the reasons that some have decided to make the journey."}
{"original": "In 2016, nearly half of the people apprehended at the US-Mexico border came from these three countries, compared with roughly 10% in 2010, according to Homeland Security Department data."}
{"original": "Trump: All Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration."}
{"original": "It's very difficult to know exactly how much or little undocumented immigrants cost the United States. Many experts contest the notion that undocumented immigrants are a strain on the economy. A 2017 analysis noted that undocumented immigrants make considerable tax contributions, for example."}
{"original": "Similarly, a 2018 study by the libertarian Cato Institute, which reviewed criminal conviction data from the Texas Department of Public Safety, found that immigrants – legal or illegal – are less likely than native-born Americans to be convicted of crimes. Throughout the country, there is also generally a decrease in the number of violent crimes, according to the FBI."}
{"original": "Trump: At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall."}
{"original": "Democrats have long strenuously opposed Trump's campaign promise that he would build a concrete wall on the US-Mexico border. But they did not propose a steel barrier as an alternative. Rather, Democrats have continued to oppose the construction of any new steel or concrete barrier on the southern border. They have only kept the door open to funding a border barrier as part of a broader immigration deal."}
{"original": "Trump: Sen. Chuck Schumer has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past."}
{"original": "This is correct but context is key. Schumer previously supported legislation to build physical barriers on the US-Mexico border. Most notably, Schumer and other Democrats supported the 2006 Secure Fence Act that authorized the construction of several hundred miles of fencing along the border, but not a wall. However as long as the government remains shut down, Senate Minority Leader Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have refused to offer any funding for a border barrier."}
{"original": "Democratic leaders have offered funding for roughly $1.3 billion for border security in the current shutdown fight, but not the $5 billion the President has sought for a wall."}
{"original": "Last week, House Democrats voted to approve a stop-gap funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security that would not allocate new wall funding, but would maintain the current $1.3 billion in border security money. Last year, the Senate Appropriations Committee advanced a DHS funding bill for fiscal year 2019 on a bipartisan basis that would allocate $1.6 billion for roughly 65 miles of fencing in the Rio Grande Valley, but the full Senate has not yet approved that measure."}

{"original": "Trump: More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War."}
{"original": "Some 58,220 Americans died as a result of the Vietnam War. In 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the number of total drug overdose deaths was 70,327."}
{"original": "However, the President's assertion is misleading, conflating the drugs coming across the US-Mexico border with total drug deaths in the US. In addition, it's not currently known whether overdose deaths will increase or decrease when the CDC releases 2018 data later this year."}
{"original": "Trump's figures also do not distinguish between deaths caused by drugs smuggled into the country versus those prescribed by US doctors."}
{"original": "The majority of hard narcotics seized by Customs and Border Protection come through ports of entry either in packages, cargo or with people who attempt to enter the US legally. The only drug that is smuggled in higher numbers between legal entry points is marijuana, according to information from CBP and the Drug Enforcement Administration."}
{"original": "China has been one of the leading sources of illegal synthetic opioids. However, China's role with the importation of fentanyl may soon shift, since President Xi Jinping agreed to make fentanyl a controlled substance late last year."}
{"original": "Trump: 1 in 3 women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico."}
{"original": "Trump acknowledged the violence migrants face in transit to the US, saying: 1 in 3 women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims by far of our broken system. This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border."}
{"original": "Indeed, the trek to the US-Mexico border has been reported to be violent. According to data from Doctors Without Borders, 68.3% of migrants and refugees entering Mexico reported being victims of violence during their transit toward the United States, and nearly one-third of women said they'd been sexually abused. But this very violence is also why women have chosen to travel in caravans."}
{"original": "Trump: Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90% of which floods across from our southern border."}
{"original": "While Trump's statistics on heroin deaths are true, it's unclear what a border wall would do to reduce the amount of heroin coming across the border."}
{"original": "The CDC reported that in 2017 more than 15,482 people died from drug overdoses involving heroin in the US. That averages out to about 297 individuals each week. In addition, DEA's Heroin Signature Program, which analyzes heroin samples to determine where they were manufactured, determined that heroin from Mexico made up 86% of the samples analyzed in 2016."}
{"original": "However, the majority of heroin that comes across the southern border is smuggled in privately-owned vehicles and tractor-trailers at legal ports of entry, where the drug is co-mingled with legal goods, according to the DEA's 2018 annual drug threat assessment."}
{"original": "Trump: All Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans."}
{"original": "There is some evidence that a small slice of the native-born workforce may see wage decreases because of undocumented immigrants competing for similar jobs, dragging wages down. Research shows that the negative effects are concentrated among workers without college degrees, who are disproportionately African-American, but also includes earlier generations of immigrants."}
{"original": "But in general, economists have determined that immigrants – undocumented or not – tend to help American workers by serving in low-skilled jobs that create more opportunities for the native born to move into managerial and knowledge-based roles. For example, a 2009 study by University of California-Davis economist Giovanni Peri found that a 1% increase in a state's employment due to immigration produced on average 0.5% higher wages for each worker in that state."}
{"original": "Trump: In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes and 4,000 violent killings."}
{"original": "Trump is using these statistics to paint the picture of dangerous criminals coming across the border. On balance the stats he cites are largely accurate, yet the fact is more than half of those crimes are non-violent in nature."}
{"original": "Over the past two years, roughly two-thirds of the undocumented immigrants arrested by ICE had prior criminal convictions – most of those either immigration violations or nonviolent crimes. In all, of the 302,051 arrests made by ICE enforcement and removal officers, 210,876 had prior criminal convictions. If you include those with pending criminal charges, you get just more than 266,000."}
{"original": "His numbers for assaults and homicides reflect what ICE reported: 99,207 people charged or convicted of assaults and 3,914 charged or convicted of homicides. However, the number of sex-related crimes ICE reported appears a bit lower, at more than 27,000 sex-related crimes."}
{"original": "Criminal traffic offenses accounted for the largest single category of criminal offenses, with just over 161,000 charges or convictions, according to ICE."}
{"original": "The President is including people who have been charged but not convicted of crimes. So for assaults, for example, if you only look at convictions, the number is much lower – 61,906 convictions for assault over the past two years."}
{"original": "Lionel Messi could cost Argentina's national soccer team tens of millions of dollars."}
{"original": "Messi, regarded as the best player in the world, indicated he would quit after a heartbreaking loss in the Copa America final -- Messi's fourth loss in the finals. Although some believe Messi, 29, will come back, his departure would be costly for Argentina's team."}
{"original": "It's not the only grim news surrounding Messi. On Wednesday, a Spanish court sentenced him to a 21-month prison term for tax evasion -- although he won't spend any time behind bars."}
{"original": "Still, Argentina's Football Association, or AFA, must contemplate life without Messi. It would be expensive."}
{"original": "If Messi does not return to the Argentine team, AFA will lose $20 to $25 million, perhaps even more, from now until the 2018 World Cup, says Guillermo Tofoni, a FIFA match organizer."}
{"original": "Related: Messi will not go to jail"}
{"original": "The losses would be even higher when calculated through the Qatar World Cup in 2022. Messi was expected to stay on the team until then."}
{"original": "Tofoni said countries like Italy, Spain and China have already been calling him since Messi's announcement, wanting to renegotiate payment terms."}
{"original": "Russia says it would reduce the amount paid to Argentina by $1 million for their next friendly game in June 2017 if Messi did not return, Tofoni claims."}
{"original": "Related: After Messi exits, Argentina's really bad week gets worse"}

{"original": "That doesn't include losses from other AFA business streams -- including ticket sales, broadcast rights and sponsorships."}
{"original": "AFA declined to comment for this article. Many Argentines, including President Mauricio Macri, have pleaded with Messi to come back. Subway stations and bus stops in Buenos Aires, the capital, have the sign #NoTeVayasLio or Don't go Lio."}

{"original": "Tofoni anticipates a $1 million loss just in ticket sales for each home game if Messi is not a part of the team. This would amount to $16 million until 2022 Qatar World cup."}

{"original": "President Donald Trump hasn't fulfilled his campaign promise to repeal Obamacare outright, but he's fundamentally reshaped the debate over health care in America in myriad ways during his two years in office."}
{"original": "Along with chipping away at the landmark Affordable Care Act, the Trump administration has made a historic and controversial change to Medicaid, allowing states to require many participants who gained coverage through Obamacare to work or lose their benefits."}
{"original": "Another major focus of the President: the cost of drugs. Like Democrats, Trump has repeatedly decried the rising price of drugs, and his administration has unveiled multiple proposals to try to contain costs."}
{"original": "When it comes to Medicare, the administration has continued to make private Medicare plans more attractive. And in keeping with conservative positions, officials have rolled back access to contraceptives as well as abortion."}
{"original": "Trump made his first move to weaken the Affordable Care Act only hours after his inauguration, signing an executive order directing agencies to interpret regulations as loosely as possible and to minimize the financial burden of the law through waivers, exemptions or delays."}
{"original": "But after the Republican-controlled Congress failed to repeal Obamacare, Trump unleashed a series of executive changes to further undermine the law."}
{"original": "The President also signed another executive order making it easier for Americans to access alternative policies that have lower premiums than Affordable Care Act plans – but in exchange for fewer protections and benefits. His administration cut the Obamacare open enrollment period in half and slashed funding for advertising and outreach, while at the same time increasing the visibility of insurance agents who also sell non-Obamacare plans."}
{"original": "And Trump signed into law the GOP tax cut bill that effectively eliminated the individual mandate by reducing the penalty to $0 – the basis for a federal court ruling invalidating the entire Affordable Care Act. That ruling is currently being appealed."}
{"original": "Trump also eliminated federal payments that help reduce deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for low-income participants, prompting insurers to raise premiums to cover the loss of these cost-sharing subsidies."}
{"original": "More recently, the Trump administration told states that they could apply for waivers to make more substantial changes to their Obamacare marketplaces, including altering the rules for who is eligible for federal help paying monthly premiums. These premium subsidies are essential to keeping Obamacare functioning, experts say."}
{"original": "Trump officials say their moves are aimed at providing greater access to more affordable health insurance options. They are particularly concerned about younger Americans and those who earn too much to qualify for federal subsidies. But Obamacare supporters say these actions will fray the strong protections for older consumers and those with pre-existing conditions."}
{"original": "The Obamacare exchanges, however, have proven surprisingly resilient. Some 8.4 million people signed up on the federal exchange for 2019. Still, that's down from roughly 9.2 million who picked plans for 2017. Much of the drop stems from fewer new consumers selecting policies."}
{"original": "The Trump administration plans to make even more changes to the Affordable Care Act for the coming year. It recently released a proposal that would increase the maximum amount enrollees have to pay out of pocket – a change that would affect those in large-employer plans too. At the same time, it would make the federal premium subsidies a bit less generous, which it estimates would decrease enrollment by 100,000 people."}
{"original": "But even more consequentially, it is formally exploring eliminating that annual automatic renewal of Obamacare plans. This would have a devastating impact since 1.8 million people in the 39 states using the federal exchange were rolled over this year."}
{"original": "Officials are also seeking input on silver loading, in which carriers increased their rates for silver plans to offset the loss of the cost-sharing subsidy payments. They did this to minimize rate increases on enrollees because federal premium subsidies are based on the second lowest-cost silver plan."}
{"original": "A year ago, the Trump administration made history and fulfilled a longtime Republican goal by allowing states to impose work requirements on certain Medicaid recipients. So far, eight states have received permission to do so, and more applications are under review."}
{"original": "The controversial move has already sparked lawsuits in two states, temporarily delaying the start of work requirements in Kentucky until later this year."}
{"original": "So far, only Arkansas has actually implemented the new rules, which require beneficiaries to work, go to school, volunteer or search for jobs for at least 80 hours a month. The impact has been pronounced: More than 18,000 residents have lost coverage."}
{"original": "On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly promised to reduce the cost of drugs. While he has issued many tweets lambasting the industry for raising prices and his administration has unveiled many proposals, he hasn't moved the needle too much."}
{"original": "The administration also laid out his vision for reducing drug prices in a 44-page blueprint unveiled last May. It contains a bevy of proposals for increasing competition, reducing regulations and changing the incentives for all players in the pharmaceutical industry."}
{"original": "One of the boldest and most controversial efforts involves setting Medicare's reimbursement level for certain pricey drugs administered in doctors' offices and hospital outpatient centers based on their cost in other countries, which is typically far lower. This idea prompted howls of price fixing from the industry and conservative lawmakers."}
{"original": "Patient advocacy groups are concerned about another administration effort that would give Medicare Advantage plans the ability to restrict what medications they'll cover. The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, backed by nearly 60 organizations, just launched a print and digital ad campaign to oppose the policy changes."}
{"original": "Pharmaceutical companies aren't heeding the President's call. Sixty drug makers kicked off 2019 by raising list prices on nearly 300 medications, according to an analysis by Rx Savings Solutions. And more drug manufacturers are expected to quietly follow suit in coming weeks."}
{"original": "Companies do appear to be tempering their hikes in 2019, however. The average increase was 6.3%, down from nearly 9% a year ago, taking into account different dosages of the same drug."}
{"original": "An official with the Department of Health & Human Services pointed to the lower rate of increases this January."}
{"original": "One thing that the Trump administration has accomplished is approving a record number of generic drugs, which typically have lower prices. The White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates this has saved consumers $26 billion over the first 18 months of Trump's administration."}
{"original": "Unlike other Republican leaders, Trump does not want to make wholesale changes to the Medicare program. Instead, officials are continuing efforts to reform how Medicare pays providers and to enhance the standing of private Medicare Advantage plans."}
{"original": "More than 21 million senior citizens are already enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans, and the Trump administration has made them more attractive by expanding the definition of supplemental benefits they can provide. Now, insurers can cover grab bars in bathrooms, transportation to doctor's offices and even home health aides. Trump officials also gave the insurers a hefty rate increase."}
{"original": "Trump officials are also trying to rein in costs. For instance, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is overhauling how it compensates doctors for office visits, reducing the tiers of payments from five to three, starting in 2021. But it also expanding reimbursements for telehealth services."}
{"original": "Another target: The Medicare Accountable Care Organization program, which has more than 10.4 million participants. Established by the Affordable Care Act, these organizations are groups of doctors, hospitals and other providers who voluntarily work together to better coordinate patients' care and reduce health care costs by avoiding duplication of services and medical errors. Known as ACOs, they share in the savings they achieve for Medicare, but only a few are on the hook for any losses they generate."}
{"original": "Currently, ACOs in the Medicare Shared Savings Program have up to six years before they must take on costs if their spending per patient exceeds their targets. Officials want to reduce that to as little as one year."}
{"original": "His administration has not proposed directly reducing Medicare benefits or increasing beneficiary payments, said Mark McClellan, a former administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services under former President George W. Bush and director of the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy. Instead, their proposals seek to continue to grow the Medicare Advantage program and continue to push for more payments based on value, not volume."}
{"original": "The administration is rolling back regulations that conflict with some Americans' religious beliefs. It issued two rules last year that would free more employers from Obamacare's contraceptive mandate."}
{"original": "The first one would allow non-profit and for-profit employers, including publicly traded companies, to receive an exemption based on their religious beliefs. The second would let all but public companies obtain an exemption based on moral objections. Government employers cannot request exemptions."}
{"original": "The rules were set to take effect January 14. However, they were blocked by federal district judges in Pennsylvania and California."}
{"original": "The administration also proposed regulations that would no longer permit federally funded family planning services at the same place where abortions are provided. And it has also proposed requiring Obamacare insurers to bill separately for abortion coverage and to offer plans that do not cover abortions in states that don't mandate it."}
{"original": "Hours before 32,000 educators were set to walk off the job, the Los Angeles teachers' union postponed its strike – saying it wanted to give everyone more time to prepare for a mass exodus."}

{"original": "We know there are tough decisions ahead for the more than 600,000 students and their families impacted by a strike, the union said Wednesday."}
{"original": "The four-day delay also buys more time for UTLA and the Los Angeles Unified School District to reach a deal on the main issues dividing them: how much money to put toward reducing class sizes, boosting salaries and hiring more counselors, nurses and other staff."}
{"original": "Union members say they want LAUSD to pull from its $1.86 billion in reserves to increase school staffing and to boost teachers' salaries by 6.5%."}
{"original": "But the school district says all that money is already earmarked for education spending. In fact, the school district is facing years of projected deficits, LAUSD said."}
{"original": "County officials intervene: The Los Angeles County Office of Education agreed that the school district is running out of money – and that it's failed to adequately address its deficit spending.

{"original": "Still, Roberts often afforded the administration some measure of victory even in its losing cases, such as a broader reading of executive discretion under the Administrative Procedure Act, or a chance to return with stronger arguments."}
{"original": "When the administration tried to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census and wanted to end the Obama-era Dreamers program for undocumented immigrants who came to the US as minors, the Trump arguments were hurt by contrived and flawed justifications as much as anything."}
{"original": "Trump responded to the Roberts' opinion in the dispute over the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals by saying, Do you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesn't like me."}
{"original": "Conservative plan to save vacancies for Trump works out"}
{"original": "Trump and conservative advocates effectively triumphed on a goal dating to the 2016 election campaign when Trump took the unorthodox step of issuing a list of possible candidates for the high court, and McConnell ensured that the vacancy caused by that February's death of Justice Antonin Scalia was waiting for the new president."}
{"original": "Just days after taking office in January 2017, Trump nominated US appeals court Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the Scalia vacancy."}
{"original": "Trump pats Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh on the back during a ceremonial swear-in at the White House in Washington, DC, on October 8, 2018."}
{"original": "The next year, Trump appointed Brett Kavanaugh to succeed Justice Anthony Kennedy, who retired after 30 years on the bench. Four months ago, a new vacancy suddenly appeared with the September 18 death of prominent liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for whom Trump chose Amy Coney Barrett."}
{"original": "McConnell had also stalled on Obama lower court nominations in 2016, ensuring that about 100 lower court vacancies also awaited Trump in 2017. After four years, the President has filled 177 of the 682 district court judgeships (26%) and 54 of the 179 appeals court judgeships (30%), according data compiled by the Brookings Institution's Russell Wheeler."}
{"original": "When Trump first came to office, four of the 13 US appeals courts had Republican majorities, Wheeler said, and today, seven of the 13 are now dominated by GOP appointees. These regional appeals courts usually have the last word on legal disputes because the Supreme Court accepts fewer than 1% of the petitions that arrive at its door."}

{"original": "Of cases that were heard by the justices, Trump generally saw bigger victories at the start of its tenure than the finish, beginning with the June 2018 decision that upheld Trump's travel ban. In a 5-4 opinion written by Roberts, the majority called Trump's order an act that is well within executive authority and could have been taken by any other President."}

{"original": "The justices by 5-to-4 votes, conservatives over liberals, let Trump divert funds to build the wall at the US southern border; to institute a new rule disadvantaging green-card applicants who seek food stamps and other public assistance; and, most recently, to reinstate a Food and Drug Administration requirement that women prescribed mifepristone, to end a pregnancy in its early weeks, pick up the pill in person at a hospital or clinic despite the Covid-19 pandemic."}

{"original": "The decision in Trump v. Vance regarding a Manhattan grand jury's subpoena had appeared most lethal to Trump's desire to keep records secret. Reaching back 200 years in court history, Roberts wrote, No citizen, not even the president, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding."}
{"original": "After that July 9 decision on the subpoena directed to Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, lower court judges reviewed new Trump defenses that the subpoena was overly broad and issued in bad faith."}

{"original": "For the past three months, the justices have not acted -- with no public explanation."}
{"original": "Despite his many victories and what will be a transformative legacy, Trump, of course, always wanted more and suggested he was being denied the respect he deserved."}
{"original": "Last July, when the Supreme Court spurned Trump's immunity claim and sent the Vance case back to lower courts, Trump wrote on Twitter, I have to keep fighting in a politically corrupt New York.

{"original": "(CNN) After four exhausting years of raging tweets, lies, fire and fury rants and orders for far-right extremists to stand back and stand by, it's almost over."}
{"original": "Trump is expected to unfurl a new list of pardons, including for white-collar criminals and celebrity rappers, in his last full day in office Tuesday that is likely to reflect the self-dealing contempt for justice that was a dominant theme of his tumultuous term. And there are sure to be more political traps for Joe Biden's incoming administration on his way out the door."}
{"original": "The very experience of being alive in America will change at noon on Wednesday when the mandate expires of the loudest, most disruptive and erratic commander in chief in history -- who forced himself into every corner of life on his social media feed and constant craving for the spotlight."}
{"original": "Millions of Americans who viewed the twice-impeached Trump's assaults on decency and the rule of law with shame and alarm will finally be able to breathe easily again, liberated from his strongman's shadow. Biden will be a President who seeks to unify an internally estranged nation in contrast to Trump's obsession with ripping at its social, racial and cultural fault lines to cement his power. Trump's cynical weaponizing of race reemerged on Monday when his White House chose the national holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr. to issue a commission report that minimizes slavery and insults the modern civil rights movement."}
{"original": "But this is only one view of Trump. The 74 million Americans who voted to reward him with a second term saw him as a leader who voiced their anger at political, business and media elites. Trump channeled their belief that an increasingly diverse and socially liberal nation threatened their values, religion, gun rights and cultural heritage. His exit could trigger volatile political forces among a community that will mourn his White House. The continued devotion of Trump's loyal base voters means that while Biden can wipe out many of the outgoing President's policy wins, removing his influence from politics may well be impossible."}
{"original": "As he moves into retirement, Trump's presidency will personify the divides between two halves of a populace -- one largely conservative and rural and the other more liberal, suburban and city-dwelling. The two increasingly lack a common cultural language and definition of patriotism -- and thanks to Trump and the media propagandists who sustained his personality cult, even a common version of truth."}
{"original": "Trump's political career began with outrageous lies and a conspiracy theory over former President Barack Obama's birthplace. It is ending, at least for now, with another even more outrageous one: the false claim that he won an election he clearly lost. Trump's perpetuating of this alternative reality has caused catastrophic damage to faith in government that is the bedrock of any functioning nation. His shattering of the tradition of peaceful US transfers of power threatens to suffocate Biden's legitimacy and prolong the nation's agony at a time of dire crises."}
{"original": "After his final White House departure on Wednesday, Trump's Marine One will fly over miles of iron fencing and troops protecting the US Capitol from a repeat of the mob insurrection he enlisted and inspired. There could not be a better metaphor for his assault on American democracy."}
{"original": "Biden's inaugural celebrations will also be muted by the never worse pandemic that was fueled by presidential neglect. Nearly 400,000 Americans, many whose deaths could have been prevented, are dead on Trump's watch . Like his election sedition, Trump's denial over Covid-19 was rooted in an incessant focus on his own political needs rather than his oath to faithfully execute the office of the presidency he swore in January 2017."}
{"original": "The President's premature push to reopen the country in the service of his reelection campaign last summer helped spark a murderous second wave of the virus. Future generations will understand his contempt for science through his barely believable public pondering about whether ingesting disinfectant could cure Covid-19."}
{"original": "A desire to promote his own interests was also reflected in the outgoing President's attempts to funnel cash and publicity toward his worldwide real estate and hotel empire. This was highlighted by his abortive effort to host the G7 summit at his struggling Doral golf resort in Florida. In many ways, Trump attitude to the presidency was the exact inverse of President John Kennedy's inaugural admonishment to his fellow citizens: Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country."}
{"original": "A legacy that will outlast his term"}
{"original": "In purely political terms, the President leaves office with some achievements that will long outlast his term. He fundamentally remodeled the Supreme Court and the judiciary on conservative lines. He presided over the first criminal justice reform in years. And he managed to avoid being drawn into foreign wars and beefed up US policy toward an increasingly hostile China while putting NATO nations on notice they must spend more in their own defense. At the same time, he trashed America's reputation among its friends abroad, treated another looming threat -- climate change -- with the same denial he brought to the coronavirus and fawned over autocratic US enemies such as Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un"}
{"original": "But perhaps his term will be mostly remembered for his adoption of forgotten Americans in midwestern and southern cities hollowed out by globalized free trade policies. Trump powerfully identified a populace badly neglected by Washington politicians of both parties -- as well as an audience for his populist, nationalist politics. But the facts suggest the President's tax cuts and economic policies in practice did more for corporations and rich cronies that the heartland Americans he championed."}
{"original": "His promise to furnish Americans with a beautiful health care plan never materialized. And his immigration policy and southern border wall that Mexico never paid for turned out to be more successful as a demagogic prop than in addressing the causes of undocumented immigration."}
{"original": "Trump's post-election propagandizing has added a dangerous layer of radicalization to the grievances of his supporters, millions of whom now reject the structures of US government they believe unjustly ejected their leader."}
{"original": "Partly because of this, he leaves behind a country that is now as divided as it has been since the Civil War, in which White nationalism is on the march and in which extreme groups like QAnon have infiltrated a shattered Republican Party. How Trump's voters react to his departure will not only shape the future of the GOP -- a party that has shown itself to live in fear of Trump's base -- but will have huge implications for American unity in time to come."}
{"original": "Biden's inheritance is the most challenging of any new President since Franklin Roosevelt, who took office in the teeth of the Great Depression in 1933, at a time when Nazism was building its totalitarian horror in Europe."}
{"original": "Despite Biden's ambitious goals on issues such as climate, health care and foreign policy, the success of his presidency will likely be judged on his ability to lead America out of the worst public health crisis in 100 years and the economic nightmare it created. And every President faces crises that they could never have anticipated."}
{"original": "But one thing is for sure -- his White House will be far more conventional, quiet and stable than Trump's. In fact, America may never see anything quite like the last four years again."}
{"original": "Transcript: Bush, Kerry debate domestic policies"}
{"original": "TEMPE, Arizona (CNN) -- The following is a running transcript of the final debate between President George W. Bush and Sen. John Kerry held Wednesday night at Arizona State University."}
{"original": "CBS News anchor Bob Schieffer moderated the debate that focused on domestic policy."}
{"original": "All answers are linked to the questions in the box to the right."}
{"original": "Question 1: Will our children be as safe as we were?"}
{"original": "SCHIEFFER: Gentleman, welcome to you both."}
{"original": "By coin toss, the first question goes to Sen. Kerry."}
{"original": "Senator, I want to set the stage for this discussion by asking the question that I think hangs over all of our politics today and is probably on the minds of many people watching this debate tonight."}
{"original": "And that is, will our children and grandchildren ever live in a world as safe and secure as the world in which we grew up?"}
{"original": "KERRY: Well, first of all, Bob, thank you for moderating tonight."}
{"original": "Thank you, Arizona State, for welcoming us."}
{"original": "And thank you to the Presidential Commission for undertaking this enormous task. We're proud to be here."}
{"original": "Mr. President, I'm glad to be here with you again to share similarities and differences with the American people."}
{"original": "Will we ever be safe and secure again? Yes. We absolutely must be. That's the goal."}
{"original": "Now, how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it."}
{"original": "I believe that this president, regrettably, rushed us into a war, made decisions about foreign policy, pushed alliances away. And, as a result, America is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be."}
{"original": "The measurement is not: Are we safer? The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be? And there are a host of options that this president had available to him, like making sure that at all our ports in America containers are inspected. Only 95 percent of them -- 95 percent come in today uninspected. That's not good enough."}
{"original": "People who fly on airplanes today, the cargo hold is not X-rayed, but the baggage is. That's not good enough. Firehouses don't have enough firefighters in them. Police officers are being cut from the streets of America because the president decided to cut the COPS program."}
{"original": "So we can do a better job of homeland security. I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists."}
{"original": "I will hunt them down, and we'll kill them, we'll capture them. We'll do whatever is necessary to be safe."}
{"original": "But I pledge this to you, America: I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure."}
{"original": "SCHIEFFER: Mr. President, you have 90 seconds."}
{"original": "I want to thank Arizona State as well."}
{"original": "Yes, we can be safe and secure, if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world."}
{"original": "I have got a comprehensive strategy to not only chase down the al Qaeda, wherever it exists -- and we're making progress; three-quarters of al Qaeda leaders have been brought to justice -- but to make sure that countries that harbor terrorists are held to account."}
{"original": "As a result of securing ourselves and ridding the Taliban out of Afghanistan, the Afghan people had elections this weekend. And the first voter was a 19-year-old woman. Think about that. Freedom is on the march."}
{"original": "We held to account a terrorist regime in Saddam Hussein."}
{"original": "In other words, in order to make sure we're secure, there must be a comprehensive plan."}
{"original": "My opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance, comparing it to prostitution, illegal gambling."}
{"original": "I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous. I don't think you can secure America for the long run if you don't have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people."}
{"original": "At home, we'll do everything we can to protect the homeland. I signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources. My opponent voted against it."}
{"original": "We're doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports."}
{"original": "But absolutely we can be secure in the long run. It just takes good, strong leadership."}
{"original": "SCHIEFFER: Anything to add, Senator Kerry?"}
{"original": "KERRY: Yes. When the president had an opportunity to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, he took his focus off of them, outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, and Osama bin Laden escaped."}
{"original": "Six months after he said Osama bin Laden must be caught dead or alive, this president was asked, Where is Osama bin Laden?"}
{"original": "He said, I don't know. I don't really think about him very much. I'm not that concerned."}
{"original": "We need a president who stays deadly focused on the real war on terror."}
{"original": "BUSH: Gosh, I just don't think I ever said I'm not worried about Osama bin Laden. It's kind of one of those exaggerations."}
{"original": "Of course we're worried about Osama bin Laden. We're on the hunt after Osama bin Laden. We're using every asset at our disposal to get Osama bin Laden."}
{"original": "My opponent said this war is a matter of intelligence and law enforcement. No, this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the American people protected."}
{"original": "Question 2: How did the U.S. end up with a flu vaccine shortage?"}
{"original": "SCHIEFFER: New question, Mr. President, to you."}
{"original": "We are talking about protecting ourselves from the unexpected, but the flu season is suddenly upon us. Flu kills thousands of people every year."}
{"original": "Suddenly we find ourselves with a severe shortage of flu vaccine. How did that happen?"}
{"original": "BUSH: Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the United States citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated. And so we took the right action and didn't allow contaminated medicine into our country."}
{"original": "We're working with Canada to hopefully -- that they'll produce a -- help us realize the vaccine necessary to make sure our citizens have got flu vaccinations during this upcoming season."}
{"original": "My call to our fellow Americans is if you're healthy, if you're younger, don't get a flu shot this year. Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young."}
{"original": "The CDC, responsible for health in the United States, is setting those priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly."}
{"original": "I haven't gotten a flu shot, and I don't intend to because I want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated."}
{"original": "We have a problem with litigation in the United States of America. Vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued, and therefore they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine."}
{"original": "One of the reasons I'm such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people aren't afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law."}
{"original": "But the best thing we can do now, Bob, given the circumstances with the company in England is for those of us who are younger and healthy, don't get a flu shot."}
{"original": "KERRY: This really underscores the problem with the American health-care system. It's not working for the American family. And it's gotten worse under President Bush over the course of the last years."}
{"original": "Five million Americans have lost their health insurance in this country. You've got about a million right here in Arizona, just shy, 950,000, who have no health insurance at all. 82,000 Arizonians lost their health insurance under President Bush's watch. 223,000 kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all."}
{"original": "All across our country -- go to Ohio, 1.4 million Ohioans have no health insurance, 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000, Wisconsites lost it under President Bush."}
{"original": "This president has turned his back on the wellness of America. And there is no system. In fact, it's starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits -- though they are a problem, and John Edwards and I are committed to fixing them -- but because of the larger issue that we don't cover Americans."}
{"original": "Children across our country don't have health care. We're the richest country on the face of the planet, the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it."}
{"original": "I have a plan to cover all Americans. We're going to make it affordable and accessible. We're going to let everybody buy into the same health-care plan senators and congressmen give themselves."}
{"original": "SCHIEFFER: Mr. President, would you like to add something?"}
{"original": "I want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints, and a plan is not to lay out programs that you can't pay for."}
{"original": "He just said he wants everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that senators and congressmen get. That costs the government $7,700 per family. If every family in America signed up, like the senator suggested, [it] would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years."}
{"original": "It's an empty promise. It's called bait and switch."}
{"original": "KERRY: Actually, it's not an empty promise."}
{"original": "It's really interesting, because the president used that very plan as a reason for seniors to accept his prescription drug plan. He said, if it's good enough for the congressmen and senators to have choice, seniors ought to have choice."}
{"original": "What we do is we have choice. I choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Other senators, other congressmen choose other programs."}
{"original": "But the fact is, we're going to help Americans be able to buy into it. Those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves. We're not giving this away for nothing."}
{"original": "Question 3: With rising costs, how do you keep from raising taxes?"}
{"original": "Sen. Kerry, a new question. Let's talk about economic security. You pledged during the last debate that you would not raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. But the price of everything is going up, and we all know it. Health care costs, as you all talking about, is skyrocketing, the cost of the war."}
{"original": "My question is, how can you or any president, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that we're running up to our children?"}
{"original": "KERRY: I'll tell you exactly how I can do it: by reinstating what President Bush took away, which is called pay as you go."}
{"original": "During the 1990s, we had pay-as-you-go rules. If you were going to pass something in the Congress, you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how."}
{"original": "President Bush has taken -- he's the only president in history to do this."}
{"original": "He's also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs -- 1.6 million jobs lost. He's the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today."}
{"original": "Now, I'm going to reverse that. I'm going to change that. We're going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s."}
{"original": "Every plan that I have laid out -- my health-care plan, my plan for education, my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans -- I've shown exactly how I'm going to pay for those."}
{"original": "And we start -- we don't do it exclusively -- but we start by rolling back George Bush's unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the McCain-Kerry Commission which identified some $60 billion that we can get."}
{"original": "We shut the loophole which has American workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job."}
{"original": "They just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days: $43 billion of giveaways, including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from China."}
{"original": "I'm going to stand up and fight for the American worker. And I am going to do it in a way that's fiscally sound. I show how I pay for the health care, how we pay for the education."}
{"original": "I have a manufacturing jobs credit. We pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas. We raise the student loans. I pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks."}
{"original": "This president has never once vetoed one bill; the first president in a hundred years not to do that."}
{"original": "BUSH: Well, his rhetoric doesn't match his record."}
{"original": "[He's] been a senator for 20 years. He voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they tried to reduce taxes, he voted against that 127 times."}
{"original": "He talks about being a fiscal conservative, or fiscally sound, but he voted over -- he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps, which would have cost the taxpayers $4.2 trillion."}
{"original": "He talks about PAY-GO. I'll tell you what PAY-GO means, when you're a senator from Massachusetts, when you're a colleague of Ted Kennedy, pay go means: You pay, and he goes ahead and spends."}
{"original": "He's proposed $2.2 trillion of new spending, and yet the so-called tax on the rich, which is also a tax on many small-business owners in America, raises $600 million by our account -- billion, $800 billion by his account."}
{"original": "There is a tax gap. And guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap? The middle class."}
{"original": "I propose a detailed budget, Bob. I sent up my budget man to the Congress, and he says, here's how we're going to reduce the deficit in half by five years. It requires pro-growth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of Congress."}
{"original": "Question 4: What do you say to someone who lost his job?"}
{"original": "SCHIEFFER: Let's go to a new question, Mr. President. Two minutes. And let's continue on jobs."}
{"original": "You know, there are all kind of statistics out there, but I want to bring it down to an individual."}
{"original": "Mr. President, what do you say to someone in this country who has lost his job to someone overseas who's being paid a fraction of what that job paid here in the United States?"}
{"original": "BUSH: I'd say, Bob, I've got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century. And here's some help for you to go get an education. Here's some help for you to go to a community college."}
{"original": "We've expanded trade adjustment assistance. We want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century."}
{"original": "You know, there's a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing. We talk about fiscal matters. But perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in America and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works."}
{"original": "I went to Washington to solve problems. And I saw a problem in the public education system in America."}
{"original": "They were just shuffling too many kids through the system, year after year, grade after grade, without learning the basics."}
{"original": "And so we said: Let's raise the standards. We're spending more money, but let's raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now, before it's too late."}
{"original": "No, education is how to help the person who's lost a job. Education is how to make sure we've got a workforce that's productive and competitive."}
{"original": "Got four more years, I've got more to do to continue to raise standards, to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working, to emphasize math and science in the classrooms, to continue to expand Pell Grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma."}
{"original": "And so the person you talked to, I say, here's some help, here's some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood, a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century."}
{"original": "And that's what I would say to that person."}
{"original": "KERRY: I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally."}
{"original": "Let me come back in one moment to that, but I want to speak for a second, if I can, to what the president said about fiscal responsibility."}
{"original": "Being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country."}
{"original": "This president has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see. Health-care costs for the average American have gone up 64 percent; tuitions have gone up 35 percent; gasoline prices up 30 percent; Medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago; prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year."}
{"original": "But guess what, America? The wages of Americans have gone down. The jobs that are being created in Arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we're losing."}
{"original": "And the president just walks on by this problem. The fact is that he's cut job-training money. $1 billion was cut. They only added a little bit back this year because it's an election year."}
{"original": "They've cut the Pell Grants and the Perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college."}
{"original": "They've cut the training money. They've wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed."}
{"original": "I'm going to do those things, because that's what's right in America: Help workers to transition in every respect."}
{"original": "Question 5: Is Bush entirely to blame for loss of jobs?"}
{"original": "SCHIEFFER: New question to you, Sen. Kerry, two minutes. And it's still on jobs."}
{"original": "You know, many experts say that a president really doesn't have much control over jobs. For example, if someone invents a machine that does the work of five people, that's progress. That's not the president's fault."}
{"original": "So I ask you, is it fair to blame the administration entirely for this loss of jobs?"}
{"original": "KERRY: I don't blame them entirely for it. I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it."}
{"original": "I've acknowledged that in union halls across the country. I've had shop stewards stand up and say, Will you promise me you're going to stop all this outsourcing?"}
{"original": "And I've looked them in the eye and I've said, No, I can't do that."}
{"original": "What I can promise you is that I will make the playing field as fair as possible, that I will, for instance, make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in America are not subsidizing the loss of your job."}
{"original": "Today, if you're an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas. You get to defer your taxes."}
{"original": "So if you're looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America."}
{"original": "I don't want American workers subsidizing the loss of their own job."}
{"original": "And when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent. And we're going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here."}
{"original": "The second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field. This president didn't stand up for Boeing when Airbus was violating international rules and subsidies. He discovered Boeing during the course of this campaign after I'd been talking about it for months."}
{"original": "The fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on China for currency manipulation. There are companies that wanted to petition the administration. They were told: Don't even bother; we're not going to listen to it."}
{"original": "The fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we haven't stood up and fought for."}
{"original": "I'm going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the American worker. And I will fight for the American worker just as hard as I fight for my own job. That's what the American worker wants. And if we do that, we can have an impact."}
{"original": "Plus, we need fiscal discipline. Restore fiscal discipline, we'll do a lot better."}
{"original": "Let me start with the Pell Grants. In his last litany of misstatements he said we cut Pell Grants. We've increased Pell Grants by a million students. That's a fact."}
{"original": "You know, he talks to the workers. Let me talk to the workers."}
{"original": "You've got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed."}
{"original": "If you have a child, you got a $1,000 child credit. That's money in your pocket."}
{"original": "If you're married, we reduced the marriage penalty. The code ought to encourage marriage, not discourage marriage."}
{"original": "We created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans. A family of four making $40,000 received about $1,700 in tax relief."}
{"original": "It's your money. The way my opponent talks, he said, We're going to spend the government's money. No, we're spending your money. And when you have more money in your pocket, you're able to better afford things you want."}
{"original": "I believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams, not tell citizens how to live their lives."}
{"original": "My opponent talks about fiscal sanity. His record in the United States Senate does not match his rhetoric."}
{"original": "He voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times."}
{"original": "KERRY: Bob, anybody can play with these votes. Everybody knows that."}
{"original": "I have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times. I broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and Ronald Reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for. I voted for IRA tax cuts. I voted for small-business tax cuts."}
{"original": "But you know why the Pell Grants have gone up in their numbers? Because more people qualify for them because they don't have money."}
{"original": "But they're not getting the $5,100 the president promised them. They're getting less money."}
{"original": "We have more people who qualify. That's not what we want."}
{"original": "BUSH: Senator, no one's playing with your votes. You voted to increase taxes 98 times. When they voted -- when they proposed reducing taxes, you voted against it 126 times."}
{"original": "He voted to violate the budget cap 277 times. You know, there's a main stream in American politics and you sit right on the far left bank. As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts."}
{"original": "Question 6: Do you believe homosexuality is a choice?"}
{"original": "SCHIEFFER: Mr. President, let's get back to economic issues. But let's shift to some other questions here."}
{"original": "Both of you are opposed to gay marriage. But to understand how you have come to that conclusion, I want to ask you a more basic question."}
{"original": "Do you believe homosexuality is a choice?"}
{"original": "BUSH: You know, Bob, I don't know. I just don't know. I do know that we have a choice to make in America and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity. It's important that we do that."}
{"original": "And I also know in a free society people, consenting adults can live the way they want to live."}
{"original": "But as we respect someone's rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn't change -- or have to change -- our basic views on the sanctity of marriage."}
{"original": "I believe in the sanctity of marriage. I think it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman."}
{"original": "I proposed a constitutional amendment. The reason I did so was because I was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage, and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the Constitution."}
{"original": "It has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process. After all, when you amend the Constitution, state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the Constitution."}
{"original": "I'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States. You know, Congress passed a law called DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act."}
{"original": "My opponent was against it. It basically protected states from the action of one state to another. It also defined marriage as between a man and woman."}
{"original": "But I'm concerned that that will get overturned. And if it gets overturned, then we'll end up with marriage being defined by courts, and I don't think that's in our nation's interests."}
{"original": "KERRY: We're all God's children, Bob. And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as."}
{"original": "I think if you talk to anybody, it's not choice. I've met people who struggled with this for years, people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention, and they struggled with it."}
{"original": "And I've met wives who are supportive of their husbands or vice versa when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were, who they felt God had made them."}
{"original": "I think we have to respect that."}
{"original": "The president and I share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. I believe that. I believe marriage is between a man and a woman."}
{"original": "But I also believe that because we are the United States of America, we're a country with a great, unbelievable Constitution, with rights that we afford people, that you can't discriminate in the workplace. You can't discriminate in the rights that you afford people."}
{"original": "You can't disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital. You have to allow people to transfer property, which is why I'm for partnership rights and so forth."}
{"original": "Now, with respect to DOMA and the marriage laws, the states have always been able to manage those laws. And they're proving today, every state, that they can manage them adequately."}
{"original": "Question 7: How does Kerry handle criticism from Catholic archbishops?"}
{"original": "SCHIEFFER: Sen. Kerry, a new question for you."}
{"original": "The New York Times reports that some Catholic archbishops are telling their church members that it would be a sin to vote for a candidate like you because you support a woman's right to choose an abortion and unlimited stem-cell research."}
{"original": "What is your reaction to that?"}
{"original": "KERRY: I respect their views. I completely respect their views. I am a Catholic. And I grew up learning how to respect those views. But I disagree with them, as do many."}
{"original": "I believe that I can't legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith. What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn't share that article of faith."}
{"original": "I believe that choice is a woman's choice. It's between a woman, God and her doctor. And that's why I support that."}
{"original": "Now, I will not allow somebody to come in and change Roe v. Wade."}
{"original": "The president has never said whether or not he would do that. But we know from the people he's tried to appoint to the court he wants to."}
{"original": "I will not. I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade."}
{"original": "Now, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic. I was an altar boy. I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me."}
{"original": "And as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, I'm not running to be a Catholic president. I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic."}
{"original": "My faith affects everything that I do, in truth. There's a great passage of the Bible that says, What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds? Faith without works is dead."}
{"original": "And I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people."}
{"original": "That's why I fight against poverty. That's why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth."}
{"original": "That's why I fight for equality and justice. All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith."}
{"original": "But I know this, that President Kennedy in his inaugural address told all of us that here on Earth, God's work must truly be our own. And that's what we have to -- I think that's the test of public service."}
{"original": "BUSH: I think it's important to promote a culture of life. I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters."}
{"original": "I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life. I understand there's great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions."}
{"original": "Take, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion. It's a brutal practice. People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice. It made a lot of sense. My opponent, in that he's out of the mainstream, voted against that law."}
{"original": "What I'm saying is is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws -- it's a great alternative to abortion -- continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs."}
{"original": "The last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs. That's great. I appreciate that very much. All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion."}

{"original": "(CNN) Joe Biden's presidency is still brand-new and already Washington is struggling to deal with his core inaugural demand like it's a foreign concept: unity."}
{"original": "It's not just that the idea of working together is completely at odds with the division pushed during the past four years by President Donald Trump."}
{"original": "It's that the two parties have been so focused on being at each other's throats for the past few decades that the idea of doing anything together is, at this point, just plain weird."}
{"original": "The major legislative achievements of recent years -- tax cuts by Trump, health care and banking reform by President Barack Obama -- were all achieved by one party steamrolling the other."}
{"original": "The pandemic, particularly early on, offered an exception to the rule, when lawmakers from both parties came together to throw resources at saving the economy as the country shut down to slow the spread of the virus."}
{"original": "Washington (CNN) Congress has approved trillions in relief funds for Americans suffering because of the pandemic recession, but President Joe Biden thinks the country needs even more."}
{"original": "Last week, he unveiled a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus plan that he wants to push through Congress, and on Wednesday -- his first day in office -- he signed executive orders that extend eviction protections for renters and payment deferrals for student loan borrowers."}
{"original": "On Friday, he's set to sign additional executive orders providing more assistance to working families."}
{"original": "Democrats have made clear that another wide-ranging economic relief bill, including $1,400 stimulus payments , will be their first legislative priority."}
{"original": "Economists, including Janet Yellen , Biden's pick for treasury secretary, say the additional aid is needed to stop the bleeding before the federal government can try to rebuild the economy. Here are three reasons why:"}
{"original": "1. The economy is still getting worse"}
{"original": "During the first week of the year, the number of new people applying for unemployment benefits soared above 900,000 for the first time since August. Claims fell only slightly last week , and they remain at the highest level in months."}
{"original": "The US economy is down 9.8 million jobs compared with its pre-pandemic level. That's more jobs than were lost in 2008, after the financial crisis."}
{"original": "Even though a majority of higher-wage workers saw their jobs return by the summer, the unemployment rate for low-wage workers remains stubbornly high."}
{"original": "Nearly 25% of those workers who were earning less than $27,000 a year remain out of a job, according to Opportunity Insights , a project at Harvard University tracking the recovery. For comparison, the overall unemployment rate is about 6.5%."}
{"original": "2. Things could get even worse before they get better"}
{"original": "The growing number of Covid cases and deaths, as well as renewed local lockdown measures, are making it harder for businesses to stay afloat."}
{"original": "The number of small businesses open and operating is down nearly 30% compared with pre-pandemic levels, continuing to fall throughout the autumn."}
{"original": "Winter weather is making it harder for businesses like restaurants to attract customers to outdoor patios."}
{"original": "And economists warn that more jobs could be lost in the coming months, despite the vaccine rollout beginning."}
{"original": "3. Traditional stimulus relief won't work during a pandemic"}
{"original": "Traditional stimulus programs like one-time direct payments or tax credits aren't as effective when the recession is caused by a public health crisis, said John Friedman, an economics professor at Brown University and a co-director at Opportunity Insights."}
{"original": "People still won't go out to eat or spend money on other entertainment if they don't feel safe, for example, no matter how much money is in their bank accounts -- and that also means they aren't buying as many new clothes or other items as they might otherwise."}
{"original": "Instead, we need to help those hardest-hit by the pandemic get through the next six to nine months until this public health crisis passes. Then we can get the economy going again, Friedman said."}
{"original": "He pointed to enhanced unemployment aid, food stamp benefits and rental assistance as programs that can provide a stopgap for people right now."}
{"original": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Monday he would press lawmakers to enact a payroll tax cut and ensure assistance is available to hourly workers amid a roiling coronavirus pandemic that's caused deep economic concerns and stock market shock."}
{"original": "Trump said he'd reveal further details of the very dramatic steps during a Tuesday afternoon news conference. As the virus spreads, the President has eyed the plummeting stock market as boding poorly for his political prospects."}
{"original": "Trump was speaking at a White House briefing following a huddle with aides to weigh options for an economic stimulus meant to blunt the economic fallout of coronavirus after s tocks plunged and concerns continued to grow over the administration's handling of the crisis."}
{"original": "Trump spoke very briefly and did not take questions, leaving it to other officials to speak about the response to the outbreak."}
{"original": "We are going to be asking tomorrow, we're seeing the Senate. We're going to be meeting with House Republicans, Mitch McConnell, everybody discussing a possible payroll tax cut or relief, substantial relief, Trump said, surrounded by officials he'd tasked to respond to the issue."}
{"original": "We're also going to be talking about hourly wage earners getting help so that they can be in a position where they're not going to ever miss a paycheck, he added."}
{"original": "While some members of Congress have publicly floated ideas to spur the US economy and help affected industries, before Monday the President had not yet endorsed any specific action and officials have offered differing views of how sweeping a stimulus plan could be."}
{"original": "Some ideas under consideration include steps to defer taxes on the airline, cruise and hospitality industries, all battered by the virus . The White House has also weighed an expansion of paid sick leave — a major focus for some White House officials, who fear the virus could spread further if service workers go to work sick."}
{"original": "Some of Trump's Republican allies have also lobbied him on a payroll tax holiday, though prior to Monday Democrats in Congress and top administration officials downplayed the prospect for such a move."}
{"original": "A senior administration official told CNN on Monday the White House is reconsidering the possibility of major economic stimulus legislation, though Trump and his top economic adviser Larry Kudlow both indicated Friday the White House wasn't interested in such a move."}
{"original": "Congress is sharing a lot of ideas, the official said. Up to the President."}
{"original": "Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley told reporters Monday that everything is on the table as lawmakers begin to consider new economic stimulus measures. The Iowa Republican would not rule out paid sick leave or a payroll tax holiday as talks begin in earnest."}
{"original": "I think it's premature, Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, responded when asked if he could support either spending plans proposed by Democrats or tax cuts suggested by Republicans to boost the economy in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. I usually love tax cuts, but I think it's a little bit premature again."}
{"original": "Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will meet with Republican senators over lunch on Tuesday to talk about economic stimulus, a source briefed on the meeting tells CNN."}
{"original": "During Monday's briefing, Mnuchin said he was in daily contact with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. He downplayed fears the US was heading toward a recession, saying the conditions did not mimic the 2008 downturn."}
{"original": "One Senate GOP member said that there was a real discussion among senators on Monday about the option the White House may lay out Tuesday, but Republicans in the leadership meeting were not really excited about some of the options on the table. We would have to sort through it. We have to sort through what the implications would be."}
{"original": "The White House has also invited Wall Street executives, including bank CEOs, to a meeting this week on coronavirus, according to an official familiar with the plans. The meeting is likely to come later in the week. The official declined to provide a list of expected attendees."}

{"original": "The President has been privately downplaying the seriousness of the coronavirus epidemic, insisting that it will be short-lived and over within a couple of months."}
{"original": "But he has been most angered by the economic impact of the coronavirus. The President told people in Florida this weekend that he believes the markets are overreacting to coronavirus. As has been true throughout the disease's spread, Trump is most concerned that he will be unfairly blamed for an economic downturn before his reelection."}
{"original": "The President has matched those private feelings with public messaging, downplaying the seriousness of the virus by comparing it to flu death tolls and blaming the market losses on the news media as well as Russia and Saudi Arabia."}
{"original": "Saudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil. That, and the Fake News, is the reason for the market drop!, the President tweeted on Monday."}

{"original": "Kudlow's predecessor at the National Economic Council, Gary Cohn, told CNN on Monday that the government will likely need to bail out airlines if the coronavirus crisis persists and that monetary stimulus will not help ease the economic pain."}
{"original": "If this crisis lasts another week or two, we should bail out the airlines, said Cohn, who added that government assistance would help prevent major layoffs."}
{"original": "Cohn called the Fed's surprise emergency rate cut last week ineffective. The move did little to calm markets, and Trump later said the half-point cut wasn't sufficient."}
{"original": "You can't fight an emotional and psychological war with financial easing, Cohn said. People aren't going to spend more — go out to restaurants, book vacations — because the Federal Reserve cut interest rates."}
{"original": "Instead, Cohn argued that the administration should be working on getting people their tax refunds faster. That might help the gig economy workers who are hurting because consumers are staying home and avoiding public places."}

{"original": "Why is your money going to companies that broke the law, and can you do anything to stop it? Get answers on a weeklong special report,The Stimulus Project, on AC 360 at 10 p.m. ET Monday."}
{"original": "Boston, Massachusetts (CNN) -- The federal stimulus program is funding roadway construction in many Massachusetts towns. But more than half of the companies that have received taxpayer dollars to perform the work have a history of breaking the law."}
{"original": "According to an investigation by Boston University's New England Center for Investigative Reporting, more than half the companies given stimulus contracts have histories of defrauding taxpayers."}
{"original": "Using funds from the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the Massachusetts Highway Division has awarded nearly $54 million in contracts for highway improvements. One company, Aggregate Industries Northeast Inc., based in Saugus, Massachusetts, was awarded two stimulus contracts totaling $8.9 million for roadwork in the state."}
{"original": "Aggregate Industries is one of the largest producers of aggregate, asphalt and ready-mixed concrete in New England. But Aggregate Industries has a record of misconduct, and six of its former managers pleaded guilty or were convicted of defrauding the government."}
{"original": "The company supplied thousands of truckloads of substandard concrete to Boston's Big Dig project. The Big Dig, which cost $22 billion and was the most expensive highway project in the U.S., rerouted Interstate 93 underneath the center of Boston. The project was plagued with problems, mainly due to shoddy construction and inferior materials."}
{"original": "In 2007, the state of Massachusetts announced a fraud settlement against Aggregate Industries, alleging that for years the company had supplied defective concrete to the Big Dig project. According to the settlement, the quality of the concrete was so poor that it wouldn't set properly, which led to cracking, leaking and other defects."}
{"original": "The company agreed to pay $50 million in fines, and this past summer six of the company's former managers pleaded guilty or were convicted of defrauding the government."}
{"original": "But two years later, Aggregate is using taxpayer dollars to perform roadwork in Harvard, Littleton, Avon and Stoughton, Massachusetts."}
{"original": "Luisa Paiewonsky is the Highway Division administrator for the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, which is responsible for allocating stimulus funds for transportation projects."}
{"original": "Asked why the department continues to work with companies that have defrauded the state in the past, Paiewonsky replied, We do have a history of referring contractors to the attorney general's office, and we have suspended contractors in the past."}
{"original": "But Aggregate isn't alone. The New England Center for Investigative Reporting found that 13 of the 21 companies that got federal transportation money have a history of misconduct. Aggregate is just one of the most glaring examples."}
{"original": "Paiewonsky said she can only follow the law with Aggregate Industries -- the law laid out in its settlement."}
{"original": "Under that agreement finalized by the U.S. attorney, the Massachusetts attorney general and the U.S. Department of Transportation, Aggregate Industries paid a $50 million fine and was put on probation overseen by a federal monitor, who was to ensure the company abided by federal and state rules. The settlement also stipulated that Aggregate Industries would not be cut off from government contracts."}
{"original": "Nancy Sterling, a spokeswoman for Aggregate Industries, said the company learned its lesson."}
{"original": "The company took it extremely seriously. It's a very different company prior to the 'Big Dig.' There are new managers, new owners and a whole new corporate ethics and compliance policy in place."}
{"original": "Sterling said Aggregate Industries had lived up to the terms of the settlement and is not doing anything wrong."}
{"original": "We paid the fine, and part of the reason we agreed to settle was we would be allowed to continue to do work for the government, she said."}
{"original": "But even Paiewonsky admits she had a visceral reaction when the state Department of Transportation gave another contract to the company."}
{"original": "I have to follow the law, and I can only go as far as the law will allow me to go. We punished them as far as we could. They're back, Paiewonsky said."}
{"original": "Aggregate Industries Northeast is part of a major multinational corporation. It has spent thousands of dollars on lobbying and political donations over the years, according to federal election records."}
{"original": "One state official told CNN the company is such a huge contractor in New England that many projects would not be accomplished without it."}
{"original": "So even after selling bad concrete that caused a $22 billion highway project to leak excessively, the state of Massachusetts has re-contracted Aggregate for another project and is using federal taxpayer dollars to fund it."}

{"original": "I don't understand why anyone in Britain – or anywhere else, for that matter – cares about the royal wedding. And yet here I am obsessively clicking on every story, paying attention to all the details and eagerly awaiting the big day."}
{"original": "That we worship the rich and glamorous elites while simultaneously raging against the rampant inequality that produces them is a paradox that sums up the state of our world at the moment."}
{"original": "You would think in an era of rising economic inequality and amid surging populist sentiment, we wouldn't care about princes and princesses, right? If anything, they might even be a source of frustration for us. After all, did you know that in addition to an estimated net worth of $88 billion, the British royal family has many of its expenses paid for by taxpayers?"}
{"original": "And this, despite the fact that Britain has responded to tough economic times by resorting to fiscal austerity – such that according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the UK's budget today is effectively the same as it was 10 years ago. According to the Independent, The major report from the UK's leading economic think tank shows that deep cuts have left the [National Health Service], schools and prisons in a 'fragile state', and have merely returned public spending to pre-financial crisis levels."}
{"original": "In the United States, we can also expect wall-to-wall media coverage of the royal wedding. Even though our nation was founded, in part, in rebellion against the arbitrary authority of monarchy. Imperfect republic though we might be, we still seem to have a reason to worship celebrity, and I think that's where the fixation with royalty comes in – that in an increasingly, seemingly hopeless era of economic inequality and political intransigence, maybe we think our only hope is being whisked off to a castle."}
{"original": "Hard work has never paid what it should and is certainly paying off worse than ever today. In the United States, it's becoming increasingly difficult to ascend the economic ladder, especially from the lower rungs. For instance, a study by economists at the University of Massachusetts found that only those who already start with an economic advantage are likely to continue making good money throughout their working lives."}
{"original": "Similarly in the United Kingdom, research finds that geography determines opportunity – social and economic mobility is simply more constrained if you're born in certain parts of the country.

{"original": "If you think about it, each of us could retire today -- we just probably wouldn't have the kind of income we want or need. Thus, most of us need some more time in which to build a fatter income stream."}
{"original": "A powerful tool to help us is the 401(k) account. Just be sure to use it effectively."}
{"original": "Here are three dumb 401(k) moves to avoid."}
{"original": "Dumb 401(k) move No. 1: Not participating or under-participating"}
{"original": "One of the worst things you can do with a 401(k) account is not use it -- or underuse it. There are more than 600,000 defined contribution plans such as 401(k)s in existence, with more than 70 million people participating in them. As of late 2016, there was about $7 trillion in 401(k) plans."}
{"original": "That sure seems like a lot of money, but most accounts are far from able to support anyone in retirement. For example, the average 401(k) account balance in Fidelity Investments-managed plans hit a record average of $92,500 as of the end of 2016. Indeed, income from 401(k) accounts has been estimated to represent about 25% to 30% of overall retirement income."}
{"original": "Thus, it's best to be socking away as much as you can for retirement, whether in IRAs, 401(k) accounts, or elsewhere."}
{"original": "One big plus for 401(k) plans is that they have much more generous contribution limits than IRAs (which only accept up to $6,500 in 2017). For 2017, you can contribute up to a whopping $18,000 to a 401(k) account, plus another $6,000 for those 50 or older, for a grand total of $24,000."}
{"original": "Maybe you can't immediately sock away $18,000 or $24,000 in your 401(k) each year, but whatever level you start at, aim to increase it regularly. Contributing 10% of your earnings? Try to make it 11% next year."}
{"original": "If you're not contributing the maximum to your account, be sure to at least contribute enough to grab all available matching funds from your employer. As an example, a common match is a dollar-for-dollar one up to 3% of your earnings. If you earn $75,000 and contribute 3%, or $2,250, to your account, you would get another $2,250 from your employer -- and that's free, guaranteed money."}
{"original": "Dumb 401(k) move No. 2: Investing less effectively than you could"}
{"original": "The next dumb thing you can do with your 401(k) is to invest in suboptimal ways in it. For example, a 401(k) plan will typically feature default investment choices, and they tend to be conservative ones that won't serve you well if you're young -- and they may not be great if you're older, either. Make sure that you decide how your 401(k) money will be invested. Don't just leave your account plowing your contributions into conservative default investments."}
{"original": "Where should you put your money? Well, it's hard to beat inexpensive, broad-market index funds, such as ones based on the S&P 500 or the total U.S. or world stock market. They will likely outperform most managed stock mutual funds. There are bond index funds, too."}
{"original": "Don't succumb to emotions. If the market crashes and the value of your 401(k) account shrinks, don't panic and stop contributing to it. That's actually an excellent time to contribute more, as stock prices for good companies will be low -- as if on sale. Similarly, don't get caught up in greed, either, chasing after riskier funds that have had a good year. Be patient and you can accumulate a lot of wealth over time."}
{"original": "It's smart to know what kinds of fees you're being charged in your 401(k). You can compare your employer's 401(k) with other companies' at BrightScope.com. If your fees seem steep, let your company know."}
{"original": "Increasingly, many employers are offering the option of a Roth 401(k) account, which accepts only taxed, not pre-tax, contributions. Give it serious consideration, as it offers the chance to withdraw money from your account in retirement tax-free."}
{"original": "Dumb 401(k) move No. 3: Interfering with your 401(k)'s growth"}
{"original": "Finally, don't interfere with your 401(k) account's growth. Many people cash out their 401(k) accounts when they leave a job. That's a terrible thing to do because it robs your future of retirement dollars that will likely be needed. If you withdraw just $20,000 that might have remained invested for 20 years, averaging 8% annual growth, you miss out on more than $90,000 in future funds."}
{"original": "When you leave a job, you can do well to rollover funds in your 401(k) into an IRA, where fees might be lower and investment options broader. Read up on the rules, though, lest you end up facing a fine for doing it wrong."}
{"original": "Another option many have when closing out a 401(k) account is to convert that money into an annuity that will pay regular sums monthly in retirement. If the annuity is from a highly rated insurer, it's like buying almost-guaranteed income that can help you sleep better in your golden years. Just be sure it's a fixed annuity and not a variable or indexed one, as those are more problematic."}
{"original": "Don't borrow money from your 401(k), either, if you can in any way avoid it. Borrowing means removing dollars that could be working and growing for you -- and that may never be repaid if you run into more trouble. (Not repaying a 401(k) loan can result in penalties and taxes, too.)"}

{"original": "I have questions about the maximum safe withdrawal rate, or the 4% rule. If you're withdrawing the money from an IRA, do you factor in your marginal tax rate to arrive at the 4% withdrawal? And how do you adjust withdrawals in reaction to strong or weak investment results?--J.N."}
{"original": "The 4% rule is probably the best-known strategy for turning money in IRAs, 401(k)s and other retirement accounts into income you can count on for life. Despite all that's been written about it over the years, however, many people still aren't completely clear about how this rule works."}
{"original": "So I'm going to try to answer your question and explain the ins and outs of this withdrawal strategy by boiling it down to three essential points:"}
{"original": "1. The basics of the rule are pretty simple, but they're still sometimes misunderstood."}
{"original": "Many people mistakenly believe that to follow the 4% rule you simply withdraw 4% of your nest egg's value each year throughout retirement. Not so. You withdraw 4% of the total value of your nest egg the first year of retirement. Then you increase the dollar value of all subsequent annual withdrawals by the inflation rate to maintain your purchasing power."}
{"original": "So, for example, if you have total retirement savings of $1 million and inflation is running at 2% a year, you would withdraw $40,000, or 4% of your $1 million, the first year of retirement, $40,800 the second year, $41,600 the third, $42,450 the fourth, and so forth. Following the 4% rule doesn't guarantee that you won't run out of money. But sticking to this schedule of withdrawals should provide a reasonable level of assurance that your nest egg will last at least 30 years, which, as this longevity calculator shows, is about how long you should plan for your money to support you in retirement given today's long lifespans."}
{"original": "I'm often asked whether dividends and capital-gains distributions that are paid in cash, as opposed to re-invested, should be included in calculating the withdrawal. The answer is yes. For example, if you plan to withdraw $40,000 in a given year and you will receive $15,000 in dividends or capital gains distributions in cash, then you would draw only $25,000 from your nest egg, so that the combination of dividends, distributions and the withdrawal gets you to your $40,000 target."}
{"original": "As for your question of whether your tax rate should play a role in calculating the withdrawal rate, the answer is no. Here's why: Let's say you withdraw 4% of your nest egg's value, or $40,000. Whatever you may end up paying in taxes on that amount (or not paying if you're withdrawing from a Roth account), doesn't change the fact that the value of your nest egg has dropped by $40,000. And it's the change in your nest egg's value over time, not how much you end up with in spending cash after paying taxes on a withdrawal, that determines how long your savings will last."}
{"original": "Of course, you could compensate for taxes by increasing the amount you withdraw. For example, if you're pulling money from a traditional IRA and you're being taxed at the new federal 24% tax rate, you could withdraw roughly $52,600 so you'd end up with $40,000 after taxes. But then you would have increased your withdrawal rate to almost 5.3%, and a higher withdrawal rate would increase your chances of depleting your nest egg prematurely."}
{"original": "So you should think of the 4% rule only as a way to estimate how much you can withdraw from your nest egg if you want your savings to last throughout retirement. The rule isn't meant to ensure you'll have enough income to live on. Depending on the size of your nest egg and other resources, a 4% withdrawal rate could be just right for your needs, fall short of them or generate more income than you actually require."}
{"original": "2. The 4% figure isn't carved in stone."}
{"original": "What we now call the 4% rule comes out of research by financial planner William Bengen in the early 1990s. Essentially, Bengen tested a variety of withdrawal rates on several different allocations of stocks and bonds using inflation data and investment returns going back to 1926. After crunching the numbers, he concluded: Assuming a minimum requirement of 30 years of portfolio longevity, a first-year withdrawal of 4%, followed by inflation-adjusted withdrawals in subsequent years, should be safe."}
{"original": "But given low bond yields and modest projected returns for stocks in recent years, a number of retirement experts have cautioned that the 4% rule might not provide the same margin of safety against running out of money as it has in the past."}
{"original": "For example, David Blanchett of Morningstar and Wade Pfau and Michael Finke of The American College of Financial Services have suggested that retirees who don't want to outlive their savings may need to scale back their initial withdrawal rate to 3% or so. Similarly, Newfound Research managing director Justin Sibears has warned in more recent research that to the extent the huge run-up in stock values of recent years leads to modest investment returns in the years ahead, retirees may need to go with an initial withdrawal rate of less than 4%."}
{"original": "That's not to say that everyone has written off the 4% rule. In his Nerd's Eye View blog, financial planner Michael Kitces has pointed out that since the late 1800s there have been a number of times when bond yields have been low and stocks have performed abysmally. Still, Kitces notes that a portfolio invested 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds following the 4% rule has never ran out of money over a 30-year period. Indeed, more often than not someone with that asset mix and adhering to the rule would have ended up with more than double the amount they started with after 30 years."}
{"original": "Still, absent a way to predict the future path of inflation and the investment markets, it's impossible to know with absolute certainty that you won't outlive your savings by employing the 4% rule. Given that inherent uncertainty, I'd say choosing a withdrawal rate comes down to how concerned you are about running through your nest egg too quickly."}
{"original": "If you find the possibility of watching your savings balance dwindle in your dotage a terrifying prospect, then you might want to start with a withdrawal rate closer to 3% than 4%. On the other hand, if you have lots of maneuvering room -- say, substantial home equity or other resources to fall back on or the ability to scale back your spending without too severely crimping your retirement lifestyle -- then you might start with a withdrawal rate of 4%, or even higher."}
{"original": "Which brings us to the third important point you need to know about the 4% rule..."}
{"original": "3. Whether you start with 4% or some other rate, you've got to be ready to adjust your withdrawals."}
{"original": "It would be nice for budgeting purposes if you could set an inflation-adjusted withdrawal schedule that would guarantee your money will last exactly as long as you do. But that's not realistic. For one thing, we don't know how long we'll live. And even if we did, we still don't know how the investment markets will perform. So you want to arrive at a balance between spending down your nest egg too quickly (and running out of savings while you've still got a lot of living to do) and spending it too slowly (and ending up with a huge retirement stash late in life and regretting you hadn't spent more freely earlier in retirement)."}
{"original": "The way to do that is to adjust your withdrawals up or down as you go through retirement. If the market goes on a tear for a few years and your nest egg's value starts to swell despite withdrawals, then you might want to increase the size of your withdrawals for a few years or treat yourself by taking out some extra dough for an overseas trip or whatever."}
{"original": "Conversely, if the market takes a big hit or churns out a series of subpar returns and your nest egg's value drops precipitously, you might want to skip a couple of inflation increases or even scale back the amount you withdraw."}
{"original": "I don't know of any way to get this balancing act exactly right. Again, there are just too many unknowns -- how long you'll live, how the financial markets will perform, what your retirement expenses will be (with health care costs being a particularly unpredictable wild card). But one possibility is to follow a prescribed system for making adjustments. For example, Vanguard has developed what it refers to as a dynamic approach to spending that involves setting an initial level of withdrawals and then allowing each year's withdrawal to fluctuate within a given range, say, never increasing more than 5% or falling more than 2.5%."}
{"original": "Or you can take a less formal approach. Every year or so you can go to a retirement income calculator that estimates the chances that your nest egg will last throughout retirement and plug in your current savings balance and planned withdrawals. If the calculator shows that your chances of depleting your nest egg have risen significantly in recent years, then you may want to scale back your planned withdrawal. If your chances of running through your savings have dropped precipitously, then you might consider boosting the amount you pull from savings."}
{"original": "As you go through this process, keep in mind that once you reach age 70 1/2, you must make required minimum distributions from 401(k)s, IRAs and similar retirement accounts, even if it means pulling more from your nest egg than you wish.

{"original": "(CNN) -- The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform did not go far enough when it proposed the repeal of certain provisions of the mortgage interest deduction. The deduction for mortgage interest should be repealed in its entirety."}
{"original": "Most people know that owning a home comes with tax advantages such as the deduction for mortgage interest, but they don't know how much of an anomaly that is. Most personal, family or living expenses are not tax deductible. They are the result of choices."}
{"original": "Your decisions on what to wear to work or whether to pay cash or credit are your personal choices. You don't get a tax deduction. That's why rent is not deductible, even though roughly one-third of Americans are renters -- which includes the majority of blacks and Latinos. Where you live is considered to be the result of a personal choice."}
{"original": "The deduction for mortgage interest is a huge exception to the general rule, because what could be more personal than the decision to buy a home?"}
{"original": "In 1986, an exception was made for home mortgage interest as a way to encourage homeownership. That's the good news for homeowners."}
{"original": "The bad news for renters is that the 2010 estimated revenue loss of the tax subsidy for homeownership is greater than $200 billion. By comparison, the entire Housing and Urban Development budget is less than $50 billion. That is a pretty high price to pay to encourage homeownership. But as long as it actually encourages people to buy homes, it could be money well spent."}
{"original": "Yet economists generally believe that the mortgage interest deduction does virtually nothing to encourage people to buy homes. During the past 40 years, while tax rates have changed dramatically (making the value of the tax benefits fluctuate), the homeownership rate has been quite stable. The biggest increase in homeownership rates happened after World War II and came after innovations in mortgage financing."}
{"original": "That does not mean that homeowners aren't aware of the tax break when they buy a house. In fact, they are paying for the tax subsidy when they buy their homes, because the mortgage interest deduction is built into the price."}
{"original": "But homeowners do not decide to buy a house because of the tax break. Research shows that the tax deduction simply rewards behavior -- buying a home -- that was going to happen anyway. The tax subsidy does encourage the purchase of bigger and more expensive homes; tax dollars are subsidizing McMansions. The American people are getting nothing good for their $200 billion subsidy."}
{"original": "In order to benefit from the mortgage interest deduction, homeowners must itemize deductions and not take the standard deduction. President Bush's Tax Reform Commission documented that only 54 percent of those with mortgages benefit from the mortgage interest deduction. That means 46 percent of homeowners have paid for the benefit of the mortgage interest deduction when they bought their house but do not receive any tax benefits."}
{"original": "So most low-income homeowners are paying for a tax benefit that only a few will receive. The overwhelming majority of homeowners whose household income is $40,000 or less do not receive any tax benefit from mortgage interest payments. Once income hits $50,000, then the majority of homeowners do receive tax benefits. Clearly, tax benefits for the mortgage interest deduction are flowing to middle and upper income taxpayers."}
{"original": "While the mortgage interest deduction may help people who are struggling to make ends meet, they are not the only ones struggling. According to a May 2010 Wall Street Journal article, the ranks of renters are increasing because of record foreclosures. Struggling or not, these new renters will not have a tax subsidy."}
{"original": "Should we continue giving away a $200 billion subsidy every year to middle- and upper-income taxpayers to encourage them to do what they were already going to do? We simply cannot afford it any longer."}
{"original": "The American public must be convinced that repeal of the mortgage interest deduction is a first step in the larger goal toward creating a tax code that is fairer for all and treats renters and homeowners alike. We all have housing costs. Why should only some get a tax break?"}

{"original": "So simply taking a look at how your 401(k) or IRA performed in 2016 will mean you're already doing more than most Americans."}

{"original": "Calculator: Are you behind on retirement saving?"}
{"original": "But you don't necessarily need to make changes to your game plan. Here are four things to ask yourself to make sure you're on track in the new year."}
{"original": "1. How much did I spend last year?"}
{"original": "It's hard to know how much money you'll need in retirement if you don't know how much you spend each year to support your lifestyle. Experts suggest looking at a few months from the past year."}
{"original": "Most people are blown away by their spend number, said Tim McGrath, a CFP and founding partner at Riverpoint Wealth Management."}
{"original": "That's partly because they don't take into account the one-time purchases, like a new couch or furnace, that don't occur each month."}
{"original": "There's always something that's not in the budget that throws everything for a loop, McGrath said."}
{"original": "2. Can I increase my future contributions?"}
{"original": "Don't think of your savings as a leftover. Put it in your budget along with your expenses."}
{"original": "Many financial planners suggest saving 15% of your gross income."}
{"original": "When you're saving for a longer-term financial goal like retirement, it's prudent to save at least 15% of your income, Nichols said."}
{"original": "Related: How much should I have saved for retirement right now?"}
{"original": "If you're not hitting that target yet, think about increasing your contribution by 1% at the start of the new year or when you get a raise."}
{"original": "In 2017, you can defer up to $18,000 of your salary to your 401(k) and contribute as much as $5,500 to your IRA -- the same amount as last year. (Once you're 50 or older, those caps increase to $24,000 in a 401(k) and $6,500 in an IRA.)"}
{"original": "3. Did I max out my IRA last Year? There's still time."}
{"original": "New Year's Day has come and gone, but there's still time to play catchup on last year's savings goal. If you weren't able to contribute to your IRA in 2016 (or simply forgot), but have the financial means to do so now -- you're in luck."}
{"original": "You get an extra three months (or until you file your 2016 taxes) to contribute up to the cap for your Traditional, Roth or SEP IRA, said Megan Gorman, Managing Partner at Chequers Financial Management."}
{"original": "If you've already hit the limit in 2016, you can continue to contribute to your IRA and it will count toward the 2017 tax year."}
{"original": "You don't, however, get an extra three months to contribute up to the $18,000 max for your 401(k). Any money you contribute in the new year will automatically count towards your 2017 limit."}
{"original": "When you first set up your retirement portfolio you, hopefully, set a diversified mix of stocks and bonds that is appropriate for your age. The closer you get to retirement, the less risk you'll want to take on."}
{"original": "Chances are, you had a good year. Overall, the stock market ended with gains in 2016 and the average investor made just over 5%, according to Openfolio."}
{"original": "But sometimes your balance can get out of whack if particular stocks did better than others over the past year."}
{"original": "Nichols says a good rule of thumb is to rebalance your portfolio if any of your buckets are off by more than 5%."}
{"original": "If, for example, you're goal was to have 25% of your portfolio in international stocks and now they take up more than 30%, you might want to make a change. To get back to your original plan, you can either contribute less of your money to international stocks this year, or sell some and buy more of whatever bucket in your portfolio fell in value last year."}

{"original": "(CNN) Congress has just passed a historic $2 trillion stimulus package that was signed into law by President Donald Trump on Friday afternoon. Beyond giving most Americans direct assistance in the form of a one-time check, it extends unemployment benefits to workers who don't traditionally have access because they don't have an employer via a new program called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance."}
{"original": "This extension is incredibly important because, according to the Freelancers Union, full-time freelancers made up 28% of the American workforce in 2019 ; in 2014, they made up just 17%. Nonetheless, there are already signs that the implementation of unemployment benefits for self-employed people will be riddled with problems and inconsistencies."}
{"original": "Last week, the president of the Freelancers Union, Rafael Espinal, sent a letter to New York City and state lawmakers, urging them to consider the specific plight of freelancers. He wrote, Unlike traditional employees, freelancers are excluded from receiving paid leave and unemployment insurance, and shoulder the cost of their own health and disability insurance. Without a concerted effort to extend relief to these workers, the economic impact of COVID-19 on independent workers will be nothing less than devastating."}
{"original": "Fortunately, this new stimulus package is vastly more inclusive and equitable in terms of addressing the scope of the Covid-19-related economic crisis than the Families First Coronavirus Response Act passed earlier this month. The latter provided no direct aid to self-employed freelancers and gig workers, who make up almost a third of the American workforce. The only thing it promised was eventual help in the form of tax credits equal to what freelancers would have been paid during the affected period."}
{"original": "While tax credits help some freelancers -- especially those highly paid ones who tend to take a hit when it's time to pay taxes -- they are essentially too little, too late for many of us. According to the Freelancing in America report , the median hourly rate among freelancers overall is $20/hour (gross annual salary of $41,600), while for skilled freelancers, it's $28/hour ($58,240/year). In other words, most freelancers don't have much in the way of a rainy day fund. In addition, many freelancers file their taxes annually rather than quarterly, which means that they wouldn't see the aid from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act until spring 2021."}
{"original": "Thus, many freelancers are breathing a sigh of relief that they too will be included in the new stimulus package. As Espinal told me by phone, This is going to hopefully ensure that there's cash flow into the homes of freelancers, who, he stressed, are doubly affected by this crisis because we depend on many of the non-essential small businesses that have been shut down in order to do our work."}
{"original": "Espinal also noted that Pandemic Unemployment Assistance wouldn't have been achieved if not for the committed negotiating of Democratic senators, which resulted in a delay in an agreement by a few days, but ultimately a better deal. Espinal was in close contact with Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer's office to make sure freelancers were included in the language of the package."}
{"original": "In a tone-deaf move devoid of empathy for what Americans are going through, some GOP senators objected to the extra unemployment benefits that would be offered to eligible workers, $600 per week, feeling that it was too generous (as Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii tweeted) and might disincentivize people to go back to work once the crisis is over. This of course ignores the fact that the extra unemployment benefits only last for four months and wouldn't be indefinite. And, just before the House passed the stimulus bill Friday, a Republican representative, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, attempted to thwart its passage by requesting a full roll-call vote and forcing many members of the House to travel to Washington (despite the fact that this is ill-advised and risky during a pandemic) to block him."}

{"original": "Still, despite freelancers' inclusion in the stimulus package, for freelancers like me in California, this extension of benefits is coming at a time when many of our careers have already been upended by AB5. This California law mandates the reclassification of certain workers formerly classified as independent contractors so that they're considered waged employees. But there are many self-employed people who aren't gig workers who work for one or two rideshare companies. Many of us are freelancers who provide services -- without key employment protections -- for dozens of entities per year, and we don't meet the standard to be reclassified as employees, nor do many freelancers want to be reclassified."}
{"original": "According to the National Employment Law Project, the new legislation's unemployment assistance will extend to self-employed people and independent contractors , and even if a state has an inappropriate definition of employee, gig workers can use this new program -- showing proof of income and an explanation of how the pandemic prevents them from working -- to get the same benefit they would if they qualified for state unemployment insurance. Whether workers can get state unemployment insurance or federally funded pandemic unemployment assistance, according to NELP, they all go through the same state unemployment insurance portal and benefits are calculated the same."}
{"original": "It's unclear to some, however, if freelancers do end up qualifying for state benefits, how the amount would be calculated. This CNBC article lays out some details and highlights the complexity of freelancers' situation: The [Labor Department] guidance should also stipulate if and how gig workers can get benefits for a severe decline in income, rather than outright job loss. Gig workers and contractors are likely to be able to get partial benefits if they don't earn too much. Also, as the article notes, many people who apply for unemployment aren't granted the benefits: approval rates range from a shockingly low 10.5% in North Carolina to over 50% in New Jersey."}
{"original": "For those of us with varying incomes from month to month, and who don't have anchor clients (repeat clients) who have explicitly told us they can no longer contract with us because of Covid-19, it's very difficult to prove that we're losing income because of the pandemic. For example, how does a freelancer writer know if a story they pitched isn't picked up because the outlet doesn't want it, or because they no longer have the budget for it? Also, given that state unemployment agencies are completely overwhelmed by the millions of claims that have been filed recently, the fact that freelancers' situations and sources of income are more complex could cause a delay for many of us in accessing benefits."}

{"original": "As a full-time freelance writer and editor, I can't begin to imagine what the long-term effects of the pandemic for me will be. I know writers who cover travel, food, art and live music are reeling right now—and that an increasing number of media outlets are freezing their freelance budgets or laying off their entire staff . The media industry has been in crisis for years now , and this will only worsen the situation, undoubtedly resulting in more layoffs and, in turn, a more saturated market of freelance writers."}
{"original": "As Espinal stated in a Freelancers Union email press release Friday afternoon, This bill is an incredible victory for the millions of freelancers who are unable to work due to this crisis. He also called on state and local governments to enact their own relief packages to help freelancers. However, even with this important win, direct economic assistance still feels very theoretical for the millions of freelancers scrambling to figure out how to apply for unemployment benefits or even, like me, how to prove that we qualify. We need state unemployment agencies and the Labor Department to release clear and standardized guidelines, and to be generous in approving our applications."}

{"original": "On Wednesday we learned that we got squeezed a little more: Prices for all goods rose 2.1% in January compared with a year earlier. It sounds like splitting hairs, but that's a big difference from 0.1% inflation in 2015."}
{"original": "So prices are going up, but it's actually good news for you — at least right now. Rising inflation means that paychecks are getting fatter, too."}
{"original": "In January, average hourly earnings rose at the fastest rate since 2009. About a third of small businesses in America say they're paying employees more, the highest share since 2000."}
{"original": "Related: Inflation rose faster than expected in January"}
{"original": "Americans on average made $26.71 an hour in January. A year ago, the typical American made $25.99. Even after adjusting for inflation, workers are making a little more than they were a year ago. And wage growth should pick up even more this year."}
{"original": "Like a tugboat pulling a tanker, higher wages bring up the cost of everything else. But the average American can comfortably handle the typical price hikes we're seeing now."}
{"original": "A little inflation is good for the economy. The trick is keeping it in the safe zone. Wages and prices are like the Goldilocks fairytale: You don't want them too hot or too cold."}
{"original": "Lately they've been too cold. Obviously, if they shoot up -- like those Bruce Springsteen concert tickets -- that's not good, either."}

{"original": "Flat wages are a major reason many Americans have felt left out of the recovery from the Great Recession. Yes, unemployment fell and millions of jobs opened up. But Americans weren't making more money."}
{"original": "But a few factors are boosting wages this year."}
{"original": "1. Companies are hungry for workers and willing to pay up. That's a sign of how strong the U.S. job market is."}
{"original": "2. Several states raised their minimum wage at the beginning of the year. Not only is that raising wages for folks at the bottom, but it also boosts wages for workers with paychecks hovering just above that threshold."}
{"original": "3. The GOP tax cuts should put extra cash in Americans' wallets."}

{"original": "Let's be clear: This inflation-wage growth love story could easily go off the rails. For example, if there were a sudden shortage of oil in the world, gas prices would rise sharply, wages wouldn't keep up the pace, and you'd start feeling the pain at the pump."}

{"original": "Tesla is cutting its car prices in the United States by $2,000 to combat a cut in a federal tax credit for its buyers."}
{"original": "Tesla triggered the tax credit phase-out in July when it became the first car maker in the United States to sell more than 200,000 plug-in vehicles. The government designed the credit to be phased out for each automaker once it reaches that milestone."}
{"original": "Before that benchmark, Tesla buyers were entitled to a tax credit of $7,500 for purchasing a plug-in electric car."}
{"original": "But as of January 1, Tesla buyers will only get half that credit, or $3,750, for the next six months. The credit falls to $1,875 in July, and then disappears in 2020."}
{"original": "We are taking steps to partially absorb the reduction of the federal [electric vehicle] tax credit, Tesla said in a statement."}
{"original": "The price cut might be good news for Tesla buyers, but it was bad news for investors. The price cut could lead to a decline of about $180 million in revenue every quarter, based on Tesla's fourth-quarter sales. Tesla's (TSLA) stock fell 8% on the news."}
{"original": "The tax credit phase-out comes just as Tesla was preparing to sell a $35,000 version of its Model 3 sedan, the first time it will be taking aim at the price-conscious mass market."}
{"original": "CEO Elon Musk said in an interview on 60 Minutes that he expects the lower-priced version of the Model 3 to be available in five to six months."}
{"original": "Tesla also reported strong production and sales for the just completed fourth quarter. Total sales were up 8% and Model 3 sales were up even more, about 13%, to 63,150 vehicles."}
{"original": "That works out to an average of about 4,900 Model 3s per week in the quarter, putting it in range of its goal of 5,000 Model 3's a week."}
{"original": "But sales came in about 1,750 below Wall Street estimates for the fourth quarter, according to data from FactSet. The slight miss added to investors' concerns."}
{"original": "Analysts had been expecting that the last-minute rush of buyers seeking to get the full tax credit would be a bigger boost to fourth-quarter sales said Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities. But he said the bigger concern was the price cut, which he said came as a complete surprise."}

{"original": "Tesla said sold a total of 245,240 cars in 2018, nearly as many cars as it sold every year before last year, combined."}

He also plans to lay out an economic recovery plan in coming weeks that aims to create jobs and combat the climate crisis, among other measures."}
{"original": "Here's what's in the American Rescue Plan:"}
{"original": "The plan calls for sending another $1,400 per person to eligible recipients. This money would be in addition to the $600 payments that were approved by Congress in December and sent out earlier this month -- for a total of $2,000."}
{"original": "The new payments would go to adult dependents that were left out of the earlier rounds, like some children over the age of 17. It would also include households with mixed immigration status, after the first round of $1,200 checks left out the spouses of undocumented immigrants who do not have Social Security Numbers."}
{"original": "Biden would increase the federal boost the jobless receive to $400 a week, from the $300 weekly enhancement contained in Congress' relief package from December."}
{"original": "He would also extend the payments, along with two key pandemic unemployment programs, through September. This applies to those in the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program who have exhausted their regular state jobless payments and in the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which provides benefits to the self-employed, independent contractors, gig workers and certain people affected by the pandemic."}
{"original": "Lawmakers only provided an additional 11 weeks of support in the December package, which will last until March."}
{"original": "The plan would provide $25 billion in rental assistance for low- and moderate-income households who have lost jobs during the pandemic. That's in addition to the $25 billion lawmakers provided in December."}
{"original": "Another $5 billion would be set aside to help struggling renters to pay their utility bills. Biden is also calling for $5 billion to help states and localities assist those at risk of experiencing homelessness."}
{"original": "The plan would extend the federal eviction moratorium, set to expire at the end of January, to September 30, as well as allow people with federally-guaranteed mortgages to apply for forbearance until September 30."}
{"original": "Biden would extend the 15% increase in food stamp benefits through September, instead of having it expire in June. He would invest another $3 billion to help women, infants and children secure food, and give US territories $1 billion in nutrition assistance. And he would partner with restaurants to provide food to needy Americans and jobs to laid-off restaurant workers."}
{"original": "More money for child care and child tax credits"}
{"original": "The plan calls on Congress to create a $25 billion emergency fund and add $15 billion to an existing grant program to help child care providers, including family child care homes, to pay for rent, utilities, and payroll, and increased costs associated with the pandemic like personal protective equipment."}
{"original": "It also proposes expanding the child care tax credit for one year so that families will get back as much as half of their spending on child care for children under age 13."}
{"original": "A temporarily increase of tax credits"}
{"original": "Biden wants to boost the Child Tax Credit to $3,600 for children under age 6 and $3,000 for those between ages 6 and 17 for a year. The credit would also be made fully refundable."}
{"original": "And he proposes to raise the maximum Earned Income Tax Credit for a year to close to $1,500 for childless adults, increase the income limit for the credit to about $21,000 and expand the age range of eligibility to cover older workers."}
{"original": "Both of these are aimed at supporting low-income families, including millions of essential workers."}
{"original": "Biden is also calling on Congress to subsidize through September the premiums of those who lost their work-based health insurance."}
{"original": "He wants to increase and expand the Affordable Care Act's premium subsidies so that enrollees don't have to pay more than 8.5% of their income for coverage -- which is also one of his campaign promises. (The law is facing a challenge from Republican-led states that is currently before the Supreme Court.)"}
{"original": "Also, he wants Congress to provide $4 billion for mental health and substance use disorder services and $20 billion to meet the health care needs of veterans."}
{"original": "The plan would reinstate the paid sick and family leave benefits that expired at the end of December until September 30."}
{"original": "It would extend the benefit to workers employed at businesses with more than 500 employees and less than 50, as well as federal workers who were excluded from the original program."}
{"original": "Under Biden's proposal, people who are sick or quarantining, or caring for a child whose school is closed, will receive 14 weeks of paid leave. The government will reimburse employers with fewer than 500 workers for the full cost of providing the leave."}
{"original": "The plan calls for providing $15 billion to create a new grant program for small business owners , separate from the existing Paycheck Protection Program"}
{"original": "It also proposes making a $35 billion investment in some state, local, tribal, and non-profit financing programs that make low-interest loans and provide venture capital to entrepreneurs."}
{"original": "Biden wants to send $350 billion to state, local and territorial governments to keep their frontline workers employed, distribute the vaccine, increase testing, reopen schools and maintain vital services."}
{"original": "Asked during a call with reporters whether states could use the funds to offset declines in tax revenue spurred by the pandemic, a senior Biden administration official did not clarify. The aid is intended to be flexible, an official told CNN later."}
{"original": "Additional assistance to states has been among the most controversial elements of the congressional rescue packages, with Democrats looking to add to the $150 billion in the March legislation and Republicans resisting such efforts. The December package ultimately dropped an initial call to include $160 billion."}
{"original": "Biden's plan would also give $20 billion to the hardest-hit public transit agencies to help avert layoffs and the cutting of routes."}
{"original": "The plan would provide an additional $170 billion to K-12 schools, colleges and universities to help them reopen and operate safely or to facilitate remote learning."}
{"original": "Congress approved $82 billion in aid for schools in December."}
{"original": "Increased support for vaccines and testing:"}
{"original": "The plan calls for investing $20 billion in a national vaccination program , including launching community vaccination centers around the country and mobile units in hard-to-reach areas. Biden would also increase federal support to vaccinate Medicaid enrollees."}
{"original": "The proposal would also invest $50 billion in testing, providing funds to purchase rapid tests, expand lab capacity and help schools implement regular testing to support reopening."}
{"original": "It would also fund the hiring of 100,000 public health workers, nearly tripling the community health workforce. It would address health disparities by expanding community health centers and health services on tribal lands. And it would provide support to long-term care facilities experiencing outbreaks and to prisons for mitigation strategies."}

{"original": "And Netflix (NFLX), which kicked off tech earnings season two weeks ago by wowing Wall Street with better-than-expected subscriber gains, is up 14% so far in 2017."}
{"original": "These solid results are a big reason why the Nasdaq, the exchange which is home to these four tech giants and many other tech leaders, is up 5% already this year. That's better than the Dow and S&P 500."}
{"original": "Tech stocks fell in the immediate wake of Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton. But investors have since seem to have concluded that Trump isn't going to kill off innovation in Silicon Valley."}
{"original": "The healthy earnings from tech giants also shows that demand for tech, particularly mobile content and services, is still robust. And there's probably little that President Trump can do to change that."}
{"original": "Related: Facebook is closing in on 2 billion users"}
{"original": "However, investors will need to keep an eye on the president's policies. They could eventually wind up being a problem for tech leaders."}
{"original": "There are reports that Apple, Facebook, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and other tech companies are planning to send Trump a letter to express their opposition to his ban on immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries."}
{"original": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg have both spoken out against the immigration ban as well."}
{"original": "Tech companies benefit from having workers from many foreign nations come to the U.S. through various visa programs, most notably H-1Bs for high-skilled talent."}
{"original": "But so far, this isn't something that investors are worrying about. They are focusing instead on the here and now. Earnings are great -- and should continue to grow at a phenomenal rate this year."}
{"original": "Plus, there are other ways that Trump might help the tech sector."}
{"original": "His recent comments about the dollar being too strong and that it was killing us has caused the greenback to fall over the past few weeks."}
{"original": "Trump was mainly talking about the dollar versus China's yuan. But he also has accused Japan of trying to keep the yen artificially low. And Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro just blasted Germany, saying that he believes it is manipulating the euro."}
{"original": "Why does this matter for tech?"}
{"original": "Apple, Google, Microsoft and other big tech firms actually benefit from a weaker dollar since they generate a big chunk of their sales from international markets. The weaker dollar makes the prices of their products more competitive in Europe and Asia."}
{"original": "Related: Apple has $246 BILLION in cash, nearly all overseas"}
{"original": "Trump may also help the tech sector with tax reform."}
{"original": "His proposal to give companies a one-time tax break to bring back -- or repatriate -- cash that is currently being held overseas could give tech companies more ammo to increase hiring, acquire companies, boost dividends and buy back more stock."}
{"original": "Apple, for example, has 94% of its more than $240 billion in cash sitting in foreign bank accounts. And Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this week that tax reform would be very good for the country and good for Apple."}
{"original": "So it looks like the tech sector's relationship with Trump will be complicated. If the president goes too far with protectionist and isolationist rhetoric, that would hurt Silicon Valley."}
{"original": "But if Trump helps get the economy growing at a faster clip, pushes down the dollar and lowers corporate taxes, then tech leaders (and investors) may wind up benefiting from the new president after all."}

{"original": "The country's tax collector is among the federal agencies affected by the government shutdown, now in its second week."}
{"original": "The IRS is currently working under non-filing season shutdown plans and will be updating it ahead of the upcoming tax season as soon as Friday, according to a person familiar with the matter."}
{"original": "The possibility of a lengthy stalemate could complicate this year's tax season, the first under the new law passed by Congress in 2017."}
{"original": "During a shutdown, the IRS typically doesn't perform audits, pay refunds or offer assistance to taxpayers if they have questions, especially outside of the filing season. And while some of the lights may still be on in the building, the agency is currently operating with only 12.5% of its workforce, or fewer than 10,000 federal employees."}
{"original": "It does throw a little bit of wrench into things, said Kyle Pomerleau, economist at the Tax Foundation. To the extent that individuals are relying on the refund any delay is going to be a negative."}
{"original": "Tax filing season usually begins in mid-January, and if the shutdown is resolved by then it may have little lasting impact on taxpayers. The IRS has yet to announce when individuals and businesses can begin submitting their income tax returns."}
{"original": "But any gap in individuals not receiving money they're owed will only intensify pressure on Trump and lawmakers to strike a deal quickly."}
{"original": "Many consider it a major financial windfall that they use to help cover costly expenses or boost their yearly savings. Those who need the refunds the most are also usually among the first to file during the January to April tax season."}
{"original": "The political impasse comes at a time when there was already going to be additional complexity as individuals and corporations wrestle for the first time with new tax law changes."}
{"original": "This filing season was always going to be challenging, said Pomerleau. The IRS was still figuring that out. Individuals were still figuring that out even with the full funding."}
{"original": "The agency received two years of funding to implement the new tax law, so some of those activities including devising worksheets and tax forms along with instructions and publications have continued."}
{"original": "But businesses can't call the agency for advice on changes, said Alice Jacobsohn at the American Payroll Association. That includes questions about how the new tax law may have changed things for this year's W-2 forms, which they must send out by the end of January."}

{"original": "Biden's plan for Day One, as detailed on on his campaign website , aims at getting the Covid-19 crisis under control. It calls for doubling the number of drive-thru testing sites around the nation, investing in at-home tests and hiring at least 100,000 Americans to perform contact-tracing. He also wants to invest $25 billion into vaccine manufacturing and distribution, with the goal of getting a vaccine to every American at no cost."}
{"original": "The plan also involves providing funds to state and local governments so they can avoid budget shortfalls, and asking Congress to help schools with Covid-19 resources and covering part of Covid-19 related costs for small businesses."}
{"original": "Biden said he won't raise taxes on people earning less than $400,000 a year. But he plans to raise revenue in the following ways:"}
{"original": "Raise the top income tax rate to 39.6%, where it was during President Barack Obama's administration, from the current 37%"}
{"original": "Raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%"}

{"original": "Require a 15% tax on book income for companies"}
{"original": "Anyone making over $1 million per year would be taxed at the same rate for investment income as they are on their wages"}
{"original": "Biden also said he wants to expand the child tax credit to help working families during the pandemic to give parents $3,000 per year for each child between the ages of 6 to 17, and $3,600 per child under age 6. He plans to expand access to refundable health premium tax credits, up to $8,000 annually in tax credits to help pay for child care."}
{"original": "A study from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania projects Biden's tax plan would raise revenue by $2.3 to $2.6 trillion over the next 10 years with little impact on GDP."}
{"original": "Biden plans to create at least 5 million new manufacturing jobs. He wants to invest $400 billion in procurement investment -- processes such as supply chains -- that drive demand for American products and services, and $300 billion in research and development in tech including artificial intelligence and 5G."}
{"original": "The federal minimum wage, which is currently $7.25, would be raised to at least $15 an hour."}
{"original": "As part of his jobs plan, Biden also wants to invest $70 billion in historically Black colleges and universities and Tribal schools, a move that includes a host of initiatives including scholarships and new facilities."}
{"original": "As for clean energy, his administration would purchase billions of dollars worth of clean vehicles and products and require countries that aren't environmentally friendly to pay a carbon adjustment tax."}
{"original": "Another priority in Biden's plans is promoting racial equity. He's said he will fund state and local investment initiatives for Black and Brown entrepreneurs, as well as provide up of $100 billion in low-interest business loans to Black and Brown communities through state and local lending programs."}
{"original": "Biden is calling for $10,000 of each student's federal student loan debt to be canceled immediately as part of the pandemic relief response. An additional $10,000 of student loan debt will be forgiven for every year of community service performed by individuals for up to five years, under Biden's plan. He also wants to double the maximum amount of Pell grants and increase the number of students who can access to financial aid, while halving federal student loan payments."}
{"original": "Those who attended historically Black colleges or minority-serving institutions and earn up to $125,000 should have all debt forgiven, according to Biden, and the schools would be made tuition-free for students whose families' incomes are below $125,000."}
{"original": "to adopt for bankruptcy to set aside funds for childcare and items like toys and books. Biden also plansto adopt Elizabeth Warren's bankruptcy reform proposal, which would streamline the bankruptcy proceeding and allow people filingfor bankruptcy to set aside funds for childcare and items like toys and books."}
{"original": "He also wants to expand worker protection rights and make it easier for workers to join unions without employers forcing them into mandatory meetings or impeding negotiations."}
{"original": "Biden is looking to eliminate private dollars from federal elections through a constitutional amendment, according to his website, which would require candidates to rely on public dollars alone for their campaigns. He's also calling for a law that would keep foreign nationals from influencing American elections and create more transparency on election spending, so that an ad on Facebook would be required to disclose its donors."}

{"original": "My host entered the room where I was seated."}
{"original": "Do we know how many? I ask."}
{"original": "I think there are seven. We will begin shortly."}
{"original": "But only six men show up as they arrive in two cars. Entering the room, they take seats at a long conference table. They are quiet and appear nervous."}
{"original": "We are told we probably have two or three hours with these defectors from Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-affiliated militant group operating in Somalia."}
{"original": "Three are former child soldiers. One looks barely 17. He fidgets constantly and struggles to maintain eye contact."}
{"original": "Two adults say little, though one, a zakat (tax) collector in his mid-50s, insists early in the interview he was only a driver."}
{"original": "Another is a bearded, middle-aged man who sits at the end of the table."}
{"original": "He, I am told, is a former senior commander. An imposing figure, he has a presence felt by all in the room. He is quick to answer questions, including those not directed to him."}
{"original": "He has recruited dozens of young boys into Al-Shabaab but now smuggles out those desperate to leave the group. So far, according to my host, this man's penitence has helped almost 70 people escape the clutches of these jihadists, whose brutality is matched only by ISIS."}
{"original": "PHOTO: Iftiin Foundation John Horgan, left, and Iftiin Foundation Director Mohamed Ali visit an area outside Kismayo, Somalia."}
{"original": "These men are among the most recent Al-Shabaab defectors to join Somalia's fledgling rehabilitation program, the Socioeconomic Reintegration of Ex-Combatants and Youth at Risk. It is an ambitious effort to signal to Al-Shabaab fighters that they have a chance to walk away from terrorism."}
{"original": "Early indicators suggest the program is succeeding in attracting disillusioned fighters away from East Africa's al Qaeda affiliate. Without significant investment, however, this tiny program, and others like it, cannot fully realize the astonishing potential to thin the ranks of terrorist groups such as Al-Shabaab."}
{"original": "Iftiin Foundation, a small nongovernmental organization based in Somalia that invited me to the country, was one of several groups implementing the program until the Somali government recently decided to manage all efforts. The focus of the program continues to be to win back the hearts and minds of those once thought lost to jihadists and hellbent on unraveling Somalia's social, cultural and political fabric."}
{"original": "For 10 years, I've studied terrorist deradicalization initiatives around the world. I've visited programs in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Singapore and elsewhere. It's difficult to say if, and how, such programs work. They are often shrouded in secrecy and rarely subject to any kind of independent evaluation."}
{"original": "Most programs point to low recidivism rates as a benchmark of success. If only a tiny few go back into the arms of the group, then a program may say it is successful. This makes sense – except for two critical issues. What little research on terrorist recidivism exists suggests that compared with ordinary crime, the recidivism rate for terrorist offenders is often low, even for people who do not participate in programs."}
{"original": "PHOTO: John Horgan Housing for Somalia's internally displaced persons on the outskirts of Kismayo."}
{"original": "Additionally, in Somalia, defection from Al-Shabaab is a one-way street. The defectors tell a common story: They will slaughter anyone who goes back. In other words, defectors fully expect to be killed by Al-Shabaab if and when they do dare to leave the group."}
{"original": "The challenge for programs such as Iftiin's is to be able to evaluate success without pointing to a low recidivism rate that may have little if anything to do with the program itself."}
{"original": "Iftiin Foundation and others like it in Somalia are small groups. Unsurprisingly, the scale of the problem often borders on overwhelming. Defectors are flowing out of Al-Shabaab, yet there are not enough places for them to go."}
{"original": "The 2014 UN Population Estimation Survey of Somalia found that more than 80% of the country was under 35. And according to Mohamed Ali, founder of Iftiin, almost 70% of the population is unemployed. So even if ex-combatants want to reintegrate, there are few legal job opportunities for them."}
{"original": "Despite ongoing terrorist attacks by Al-Shabaab, defectors tell me the group is in disarray. In the past 18 months, they say several hundred men and boys have left, and there are signs of many more just waiting to leave. Disillusionment is rife, defectors allege, with many of the rank and file deeply dissatisfied with the harsh reality and associated traumas of combat. Yet most still remain in the movement, in part, because they don't see a way out."}
{"original": "I learn from the defectors sitting across the table how leaving works. A member can run away from the organization and turn himself in to government authorities. Or those reluctant to take such a risk can instead reach out to family members, who in turn contact authorities for help in facilitating an exit."}
{"original": "When defectors hand themselves in, they are interviewed by police or other government officials for up to a week. They are then classified as low, medium or high risk. It's unclear how this assessment is made, or even what risk means."}
{"original": "If defectors are considered low risk, they are released to one of several regional transition centers, a type of community center that provides food and housing, to begin the Socioeconomic Reintegration of Ex-Combatants and Youth at Risk Project, the rehabilitation program. They engage in counseling sessions and skill building."}
{"original": "A woman walks along a street in the Somalian port city of Kismayo."}
{"original": "Most of these young men have never had any kind of formal schooling. Some are trained in masonry and building, others in hospitality and the service industry. This training culminates in soon-to-be graduates receiving a micro-enterprise grant, about $1,500 in-kind, according to Iftiin, to start their own business and get back on their feet."}
{"original": "Traditional models of deradicalization involve prison-based activities, such as individual counseling with psychologists, group therapy sessions and regular meetings with religious scholars attempting to undo the ideological damage of life in such groups. Somalia's program expands on this model by focusing on what happens after the former fighters graduate from the initiative."}
{"original": "Each defector is matched with a local sponsor who can vouch for his whereabouts and well-being at any moment. Often this is a friend or family member. The sponsor accepts responsibility for checking on the defector, monitoring his welfare, and, if potential security concerns arise, communicating with local security forces. That concern is often less about fear of recidivism and instead possible victimization by community members less willing to accept that the former fighter is no longer a threat."}
{"original": "A common criticism of terrorist reintegration programs is that they are soft on those who deserve little more than, at best, life behind bars. Such reactions are understandable. Yet to ignore programs such as Iftiin's is to deny opportunities to address the terrorism problem in creative and groundbreaking ways."}
{"original": "To appreciate just how much progress this program makes, we only need look at its impact on the community. According to Iftiin, 90% of the first cohort of graduates still had their small businesses running after six months. Considering that many have lived all their lives in extreme poverty or have never had any formal education, this is remarkable."}
{"original": "It also owes something to the long-standing tradition of entrepreneurialism, as well as family support, in Somalia. One young boy, who became involved with Al-Shabaab when he was 14, had his store robbed. He had been supporting his entire family, but when loved ones subsequently rallied behind him, it helped the boy quickly reopen his business."}
{"original": "As Ali tells me, It takes a village to help these youth to rebuild their lives again and reintegration into the community – no one group or institution can do it alone. This community-centric approach has paid dividends."}

{"original": "But without more support, such success can only be short-lived and piecemeal. With 11 staff members temporarily based in locations across Kismayo and Baidoa, and one manager based permanently in Mogadishu, Iftiin has so far managed more than 300 ex-combatants."}
{"original": "Somalia's capacity to manage the flow of defectors is at a breaking point. A single mass defection event would completely overwhelm all sectors of this initiative. The government has to keep the flow moving, but there is clearly an urgent need to build and staff more centers."}
{"original": "Now the task is to promote reconciliation and reintegration by bringing together ex-combatants and community members to forge new pathways to heal together."}
{"original": "On the last day of my visit, we met with village elders and tribal leaders. They are keen to stress that they embrace returnees. We don't discriminate, one says."}

{"original": "On the surface, annuities may seem like an incredibly enticing investment to consider as part of your retirement plan. Insurance companies dangle promises of market-like returns on the upside with no risk of loss during your accumulation years and guaranteed income during your distribution years to get you to sign up for them."}
{"original": "When you dig beneath that surface, you often find that the promises offered by annuities in their marketing wind up severely limited by things like caps, participation rates, and internal fund costs."}
{"original": "Over time, those limits mean that you'll very likely wind up better off investing directly in the market via index funds than investing via an annuity. As a result, while you're accumulating money for retirement, annuities generally don't belong in your retirement plan."}
{"original": "Still, despite the fact that annuities usually make lousy investing vehicles, they can provide reasonable insurance benefits in the form of guaranteed income during retirement. Simple, straightforward single premium immediate annuities from strong insurance companies can provide people with the peace of mind of knowing they won't run out of money in retirement."}
{"original": "Simple annuities like that can work out for retirees who aren't comfortable managing their own money. After all, the risks of a poor withdrawal strategy from an investment portfolio could leave a retiree without income at a time when that retiree has no realistic way of earning a living through work."}
{"original": "Still, even the best of annuities have drawbacks that you should recognize before you commit to using them at all."}
{"original": "First, any annuity is only as good as the financial strength of its issuer. If the insurance company offering your annuity were to declare bankruptcy, you would be dependent on the limits and funding sufficiency of your state's insurance backstop program to provide you any income."}
{"original": "In addition, any option offered by the annuity company beyond the basics of a simple income stream for either a guaranteed time period or for your life will likely come at a substantial cost. Want inflation protection? That will cost you. Want to assure your heirs will get something after you pass? You're likely better off leaving that something outside your annuity than asking the insurance company to handle it for you."}
{"original": "Don't forget the biggest annuity you probably already have"}
{"original": "In addition, if you work in the United States, chances are that you already have access to a retirement plan that acts very much like an annuity that offers you an inflation-protected income for life. It's called Social Security, and even in the worst case scenario where nothing gets done to shore up the program, it's expected to cover around three-quarters of its promised benefits for retirees."}
{"original": "The typical retiree or retired couple receives enough from Social Security to keep out of abject poverty. While Social Security alone won't let you live a lifestyle of the rich and famous, it's fair to ask how much guaranteed income you really need above Social Security. Other than health-related costs, most retirees find that their expenses actually go down when they're retired. If you don't need additional guaranteed income, you might be better off with the greater flexibility that you get outside of annuities."}
{"original": "Remember, too, that even Social Security's promises are expensive to provide. The combined employee and employer tax rate is 12.4% of your income up to $128,400 of income, and it takes 35 years of those taxes on your earnings to qualify for your full expected benefit. Guarantees, are not cheap, no matter whether they come from the government or from an insurance company. The typical recipient of those guarantees will ultimately be the one paying for that guarantee."}
{"original": "Know their role -- and limit the bells and whistles"}
{"original": "If you consider them only for the portion of your finances that really needs the guaranteed income they promise, annuities may make some sense as part of your retirement plan. Just be sure to treat them as the insurance plans that they are, and understand that just like with life insurance, the act of mixing investing and insurance in the same annuity plan is rarely a good idea for you."}

{"original": "With those limits and those constraints, simple single premium immediate annuities can play a role in providing you guaranteed income for life as part of your retirement plan.

{"original": "Hands down. (*Well, there could be an exception, which we'll get to later.)"}
{"original": "Most states offer a 529 plan to help people save for college. You contribute after-tax dollars to the account, which are invested and allowed to grow tax-free. Sometimes your contributions are tax deductible, too, depending on the state."}
{"original": "Though they were created to help people save for retirement, Roth IRAs work in a similar way. But you don't get a tax deduction for your contributions."}
{"original": "The big difference between the two accounts is that the money in a 529 must be used for qualified higher education expenses, or else be slapped with a 10% penalty. The contributions you make to a Roth IRA can be withdrawn at any time for any reason. And you can take out the earnings on your investments in a Roth for more of your needs, including education expenses, buying your first home, and eventually retirement."}

{"original": "You can also save more money annually in a 529 plan than a Roth IRA. And it's possible you make too much money to open a Roth IRA to begin with. It's limited to those who earn less than $133,00 if single, or $196,000 if married."}
{"original": "Once you open either account, you'll be able to choose your investments. Your options will be limited by what's offered by the provider, and some have better menus than others."}
{"original": "The only real benefit I see in using the Roth IRA for college education savings is if a sophisticated investor is able to really take advantage of greater investment flexibility, said Jorge Padilla, a CFP at The Lubitz Financial Group."}

{"original": "How to choose a 529 savings plan"}
{"original": "In most cases, you can choose a 529 plan from any state you'd like and use the money for tuition, room and board at the college you choose. But if your state allows contributions to be tax-deductible, you probably want to stick with your home state to take advantage."}
{"original": "It's worth taking some time to research which plan will be best for you. See whether your contributions will be tax deductible and check out the fees and investment options. SavingForCollege.com ranks 529 plans based on their investment performance each quarter."}
{"original": "A handful of states offer prepaid 529 plans, which allow you to pay now at today's rates for school tomorrow for tuition at an in-state college. You might be able to use this money for an out-of-state school or a private school if that's where your child decides to enroll, but you might not get the full value."}
{"original": "Experts always recommend you make sure you're on track for saving for your own retirement before putting money away for your child's college education."}
{"original": "Children can always borrow to pay for an education but you will never be able to borrow to pay for your retirement, Padilla said."}
{"original": "Once you've made the decision to start a college fund for your son or daughter, you should try to estimate how much college is going to cost -- and how much of it you want to pay for."}
{"original": "This, of course, can be tricky if your child is just four years old. But there are several online calculators that can help. An American Funds calculator puts the cost at $168,189 for Kelly if her daughter attends a public, in-state college."}
{"original": "Related: 7 ways to pay for college without a scholarship"}
{"original": "If Kelly wants to fund the entire cost, she'd have to save about $450 a month."}
{"original": "Usually my clients see the number and say 'holy crap,' Roberge said."}
{"original": "Remember, your child could receive scholarships or grants that lower the cost. One recent study found that scholarships covered 34% of the cost for the typical American family, and that parents pick up 29% of the bill."}
{"original": "How will your savings impact a financial aid award?"}
{"original": "The amount of financial aid (scholarships, grants and loans) your child receives is largely based on your income. The more you have, the smaller the financial aid award will be."}
{"original": "Your savings, including those in a 529 plan, are treated more favorably than income. Like money in a checking or savings account, it won't reduce the award by as much as your income does."}
{"original": "This is another reason it would be better to save for college in a 529 instead of a Roth IRA. Withdrawals from the retirement account will be treated as income and could lower the financial aid award your child receives in the future if used to pay for the freshman and sophomore years of college. But 529 withdrawals will not be."}

{"original": "As the coronavirus pandemic drastically undermines the economy, arts administrator Deana Haggag finds herself in brand new territory."}
{"original": "Haggag, the president and CEO of United States Artists (USA), told CNN that a few weeks ago it became clear to her that most cultural organizations were going to be shut down. She set in and just started monitoring the layoffs."}
{"original": "In the art world, like in many sectors, the job losses were brutal."}
{"original": "For many of us, we've never been here, Haggag said in a phone interview. This is the biggest crisis our country has faced in many of our lifetimes."}
{"original": "She set to work behind the scenes to do something about it."}
{"original": "On Wednesday, her organization announced a $10 million collaborative grant program called Artist Relief . USA is working in coalition with six other major arts non-profits including Academy of American Poets, Artadia, Creative Capital, Foundation for Contemporary Arts, MAP Fund and the National YoungArts Foundation."}
{"original": "They're offering $5,000 grants to at least 100 artists per week, from poets to architects to weavers. They're hoping to be able to expand the program to more artists if funds allow."}
{"original": "She was deeply proud of getting so many organizations to agree on something so big so quickly."}
{"original": "This is cause for celebration, she said. But at the same time, she acknowledged launching the program was bittersweet. Reading these applications is gut-wrenching, it's absolutely heart-breaking."}
{"original": "She said in the first three hours, the group's portal received 2,200 applications from artists in need, and they expected to receive 10,000 on the first day."}
{"original": "From sound technicians to illustrators to ticket sellers, more than five million Americans are employed in the arts and culture sector, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis."}
{"original": "And programs like the one Haggag leads can only do so much to address the tidal wave of need."}
{"original": "The arts are indicative of the wider economic situation"}
{"original": "April's unemployment numbers showed an historic spike in the number of Americans filing for unemployment. The Department of Labor said that for the week ending March 28, some 6.6 million Americans filed for benefits, a 3,000% spike over the claims numbers from last month. And businesses continue to lay off and furlough workers."}
{"original": "As we enter a global recession, it's worth a look back at how Americans rallied during previous times of economic hardship, and to consider how it might inform our response to our present dilemma."}

{"original": "Active from 1935 to 1943, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) was a New Deal program designed to give Americans paid work during the Great Depression while jobs were scarce."}
{"original": "The program would employ some 8.5 million Americans involved in 1.4 million public works projects, according to the Library of Congress"}
{"original": "In addition to the nationwide infrastructure projects, for four of its years of existence the WPA housed Federal Project Number One. That project organized Depression-era work programs for thousands of artists, musicians, writers, theatrical performers and historians."}

{"original": "The Works Progress Administration helped unemployed artists"}
{"original": "The WPA would give some of the best writers of the 20th century their first job writing, author David A. Taylor told CNN over the phone."}
{"original": "Taylor penned the book Soul of a People: The WPA Writers' Project Uncovers Depression America, which was also turned into a documentary with the same title, chronicling one aspect of the WPA, the Federal Writers' Project."}
{"original": "That program alone employed as many as 7,500 people during its existence from 1935 to 1939."}
{"original": "The Writers' Project is perhaps best known for its American Guides, a series of locally written travel guides for cities and states."}
{"original": "Those on its payroll included would-be literary luminaries such as Richard Wright, Zora Neale Hurston, Ralph Ellison and Saul Bellow -- who would go on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature."}
{"original": "During her time with the WPA, Hurston used her BA in anthropology to chronicle life histories in the American South. She wrote her classic novel Their Eyes Were Watching God, published in 1937, while doing her WPA-funded field work in Florida."}
{"original": "Ellisson's 1952 classic Invisible Man was drawn from character studies from his time interviewing people during his job on the Federal Writers' Project in the late 1930s, Taylor said."}
{"original": "The Federal Writers' Project also preserved histories of African American folklore and life that otherwise wouldn't have been recorded. Some are memorialized in the Slave Narrative Collection at the Library of Congress."}
{"original": "In the film Soul of a People, Maryemma Graham, a professor of English and African American Studies at the University of Kansas argues that the largest single impact on black writing before the civil rights movement was really the WPA, not the Harlem Renaissance."}

{"original": "Under the Federal Art Project, visual artists were often put to work creating murals or posters. Many of their works can be see via the New Deal Art Registry"}
{"original": "Before they achieved wider recognition, the program provided a financial backstop for young visual artists such as Jackson Pollock , Mark Rothko and Willem de Kooning, who would go on to become major art-world figures."}
{"original": "The iconic Griffiths Observatory in Los Angeles was built under the WPA."}
{"original": "Taylor pointed to novelist Nelson Algren's summation of the WPA's impact on artists and writers: Had it not been for the Project, the suicide rate would have been much higher. It gave new life to people who had thought their lives were over."}
{"original": "It employed creative Americans during a crucial time"}
{"original": "It really built the world that generations experienced after World War II, Taylor said over the phone."}
{"original": "He added that if the current social distancing policies drive the economy into a prolonged recession, a larger economic program could be necessary."}
{"original": "To the extent that government spends money on infrastructure, it should anticipate who we'll be when this is over, he said, emphasizing the need to see these types of programs not as spending, but rather as investments."}
{"original": "Today those necessary programs might include anything from broadband access and the electric grid to voting systems and social media projects."}
{"original": "We need to imagine what life will be like when we emerge from social distancing and what we're going to need, he said."}
{"original": "And those programs can be tailored by sector to each person's individual skills. Noting a New Deal-era comment from his book, he said, There's no sense making a good violinist a bad ditch digger."}

{"original": "The recent stimulus is a little different this time -- which could help artists"}
{"original": "It's unclear how long or deep a coronavirus-related economic recession could last. But it might not be too early to think about how a new national arts job program might look."}
{"original": "So far, Congress has responded by passing Cares Act, a $2 trillion economic stimulus bill, the largest aid package in US history, and President Donald Trump signed the bill on March 27."}
{"original": "The bill has several major components, including direct stimulus checks to individuals, extension of unemployment benefits, small business grants, and loans to industry."}
{"original": "One key provision for artists was the extension of unemployment benefits for independent contractors who file their taxes on the IRS's 1099 forms. Many independent artists, those likely to be hit hardest by a faltering economy, fit into that tax category and are thereby eligible for benefits."}
{"original": "Independent contractors aren't traditionally included in the stimulus, Jamie Bennett, the executive director of the non-profit ArtPlace America said over the phone. That's already a big step forward this time, helping everyone from blues guitarists to visual artists to Uber drivers."}
{"original": "It was artists who invented the gig economy, Bennett said, noting that term's roots refer to jazz musicians playing shows."}
{"original": "Despite some good news around individual stimulus checks being sent as early as mid-April , and expanded unemployment benefits, the arts are uniquely vulnerable to social distancing guidelines."}
{"original": "Zora Neale Hurston worked on her novel Their Eyes Were Watching God while employed by the Federal Writers' Project. Credit: Collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture"}
{"original": "The vast majority of arts and culture is consumed in person with other people, Bennett said, explaining that a post-pandemic artistic renaissance will have to be scaled up slowly and carefully. It would start with small theaters or galleries, once public health officials give the green light, and society would only much later get back to filling large arenas for rock concerts and sporting events."}
{"original": "We aren't going to flip a switch and have people immediately going back to sitting in a 1,200-seat theater, he said. It will require an 18-month strategy."}
{"original": "In the meantime, arts institutions will need to beef up virtual offerings, and have faith that while valuable, visiting a museum or symphony performance via technologies like virtual reality or film wouldn't replace the joy of visiting those places."}
{"original": "I am not someone who ever worries that technology will replace the live experience, Bennett said."}
{"original": "Virtual museum tours, unemployment checks, and direct stimulus aid are helpful Band-Aid solutions in the short term. But they're still short of the activist role the government played in actually creating artistic jobs nearly a century ago."}
{"original": "But for now, those measures may be the only thing that artists, and art institutions, have to rely on."}
{"original": "The coronavirus recession has different financial roots than the Great Depression, and stimulating the economy can't change the fact that some jobs simply can't be done while the pandemic is uncontrolled. But we can at least rely on public agencies and policies left in the wake of the New Deal, and a patchwork of civil society programs that weren't available in the Depression."}
{"original": "The National Endowment for the Arts didn't exist in the 1930s, Taylor said. We don't have to start from scratch like the Federal Writers' Project did."}
{"original": "Taylor said programs such as the American Journalism Project , a program that employs recent college graduates at local newspapers around the country, carry the spirit of the Federal Writers' Project."}
{"original": "A 21st century program from artists wouldn't have to look like the big monolithic program the WPA was, he said."}
{"original": "One ray of hope: last week, the Getty Trust also announced a $10 million relief fund to be released in amounts ranging from $25,000 to $200,000 by the California Community Foundation. Those grants would prop up small and midsize arts institutions."}
{"original": "Bennett, of ArtPlace America, said that community development block grants would likely be a key way to help agencies and organizations that can employ artists in projects ranging from community to public health campaigns , all vital to holding society together in the face of the pandemic."}

{"original": "Art can be a balm for the nation in troubled times"}
{"original": "Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and prominent fixture of the coronavirus response, told CNN's Sanjay Gupta he was worried about how this pandemic would affect the nation's psyche."}
{"original": "I could hear it in the inflections in my daughters' voices when I speak with them on the phone, Fauci said. This is going to be imprinted on the personality of our nation for a very long time."}
{"original": "I think there's going to be some subliminal post-traumatic stress syndrome that we're all going to face, Fauci said."}
{"original": "While nearly everyone on the planet is feeling some version of what Fauci's daughter feels, it's unlikely that we can all enter therapy to sort through some of the complex emotions. Artists could help address those traumas in ways that healthcare professionals might not be able to."}
{"original": "Art reminds you that you belong to others and helps you build an identity based on shared community, Haggag said. When we're done with this, we're going to need art and religion and also sports."}
{"original": "I don't know how we recover from the collective PTSD of this, Haggag said. I think we need to be together for that."}
{"original": "Like so many aspects of the economy, from restaurants to travel to sports, the arts are strained in ways they've scarcely been before. While the situation is dire, it also directly feeds the new forms of creative expression that inevitably must come from social distancing."}
{"original": "Today, keeping expression -- and healing -- alive might entail investments that expand what art means under our current conditions, whether that be writing or video games or virtual reality."}
{"original": "One of the things I find fascinating about the human condition is that under any circumstances, human beings will create, Bennett said. We haven't yet discovered conditions by which they stop being creative."}
{"original": "New York (CNN) For New Yorkers stuck inside their homes -- and heads -- as the state and country confront the rapid spread of coronavirus , Andrew Cuomo's press conferences have become appointment viewing ."}
{"original": "Starting a little before noon, and running as long as an hour, the New York governor offers something simple and, to many viewers, deeply necessary: a sense that someone is in charge, even if the news is bad -- and consistently getting worse."}
{"original": "Everyone knows what we're dealing with, Cuomo began, matter-of-factly, on Friday . It's preventing an overload of the health care system."}
{"original": "The pressers have turned into indelible split screen moments between Cuomo and President Donald Trump -- whose own news conferences often take place during or after those in New York -- unfolding in real time for those watching in New York City. For many viewers, they are a stark and jarring reminder of the broad chasm between the federal government's response to the coronavirus pandemic and efforts at the state level, where governors like Cuomo are increasingly taking stricter action -- and greater responsibility -- as they seek to stabilize both health infrastructure and ward off a public panic."}
{"original": "New York is currently the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic with the most cases in the US and 114 people who have died from the virus. There are more than 9,000 cases in New York City alone."}
{"original": "On Friday, Cuomo's newser ran about 45 minutes as he delivered a daily update and took questions from a small gathering of reporters, all seated at a safe social distance. He covered everything from how the delayed federal tax filing deadline would affect state finances, to whether massages were essential -- they are not, he said -- the governor decidedly said -- and his chat with internet service providers, whom Cuomo said he asked to expand data capacity free of charge. After informing the public that a press officer had shown coronavirus symptoms, which touched off an internal quarantine, Cuomo stopped."}
{"original": "I'm gonna go to work, he declared, before standing up, along with his aides, and heading off."}
{"original": "As Cuomo was wrapping up in New York, Trump and his team were beginning their own briefing at the White House. But where Cuomo projected competence and authority, with a dash of his idiosyncratic humor, Trump was meandering. When prodded to offer some kind of empathy -- Trump lashed out."}
{"original": "What do you say to Americans who are watching you right now who are scared?, a reporter asked."}
{"original": "I say that you are a terrible reporter, that's what I say, Trump replied. I think it's a very nasty question."}
{"original": "Whether he was annoyed that the wind-up to the question included statistics on the sick and dead, or at its characterization -- scared -- of Americans, was unclear. They're looking for answers and they're looking for hope, Trump continued, as if observing from afar."}
{"original": "Cuomo has been blunt and at times searching, but unerringly forthright, even with unnerving information. He has been open in seeking out the equipment desperately needed by health care providers, like face masks and ventilators. Asked on Friday if the state was headed toward a cash crunch, he answered, Yes. When discussing his statewide order requiring workers in nonessential businesses to stay home, Cuomo acknowledged the potential for criticism."}
{"original": "If someone is unhappy, if somebody wants to blame someone, or complain about someone, blame me, he said. There is no one else who is responsible for this decision."}
{"original": "Contrast that with Trump, a fellow Queens native who also entered his father's line of work: a week earlier, the President faced questions at a press conference over his role in the country's failure to produce and implement functioning coronavirus tests."}
{"original": "His answer: I don't take responsibility at all."}
{"original": "'This is really what he's built for'"}
{"original": "The blundering and opacity in Washington has underscored some of Cuomo's more commonly appreciated qualities, but also opened the door for the three-term governor to surprise old friends, enemies and so many others who have found themselves on both sides of the line."}
{"original": "It's pretty legendary, our fights with the governor, said Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers. But even when we're really, really, really mad at each other, and we have been, there's always still a line where you can talk to each other."}
{"original": "Cuomo and Weingarten go back decades. Their clashes and reconciliations have offered Weingarten a unique insight into the governor himself -- how he thinks and how his actions now are being perceived by the public."}
{"original": "This is really what he's built for. He has the mind, the analytical sense and the combination of moxie and smarts and bulldoggish-ness that has made him both respected, and questioned, for all these years, Weingarten said. But what you're also starting to see is great empathy and great leadership."}
{"original": "Both Smith and Fishbein acknowledged, in their respective talkers, the weirdness of the moment. Cuomo's flashes of disdain for some progressive agenda makers -- and policies -- have made him a loathed figure among many on the left. The anger bubbled over in 2018, when he was faced with his most intense primary challenge yet from the actress and activist Cynthia Nixon."}
{"original": "He buried her bid in a slash-and-burn campaign, but progressives surged down the ballot, filling up the state legislature. Cuomo signed a raft of new legislation they delivered to his desk over the following year."}
{"original": "Fishbein ticked off Cuomo's resume of offenses to the left, but ultimately landed on something more elemental."}
{"original": "In this time of crisis, she wrote, with little concrete information available, I need Cuomo's measured bullying, his love of circumventing the federal government, his sparring with increasingly incompetent city leadership."}
{"original": "Smith landed on a similar conclusion."}
{"original": "Mr. Cuomo has emerged as the executive best suited for the coronavirus crisis, he wrote a few days earlier, as President Trump flails and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio wrestles haltingly with a crucial decision and then heads to the gym."}
{"original": "De Blasio, the two-term mayor, has been Cuomo's foil for years. But where in the past the divisions between them have largely centered on who -- state or city -- would pay for what and who -- Cuomo or de Blasio -- would get the credit, the questions now are more immediate and potentially life-altering."}
{"original": "Last Sunday, while de Blasio appeared tied up in knots over whether schools would open on Monday, Cuomo, who had also expressed some reservations, stepped forward to demand they be closed."}
{"original": "I call on the parties and the leadership in New York City to come up with a plan on childcare and on food and to do it within 24 hours, Cuomo said on a conference call. De Blasio made it official soon thereafter. But the mayor's trip, the next morning, to his gym for a farewell workout underscored New Yorkers' worries and puzzlement over his handling of the crisis."}
{"original": "Even among some of Cuomo's harshest critics, the reviews of his public performance have been largely positive -- though concerns persist over his substantial policy decisions, on issues like Medicaid and housing, and whether they will ultimately benefit the wealthy at the expense of the poor."}
{"original": "In the middle of a crisis, people just want someone to look to, to tell them what the hell is going on. And I think Cuomo is providing that outlet for people, said Jonathan Westin, director of the progressive New York Communities for Change. I don't necessarily think it means that he's actually going to do what's best for everyday New Yorkers."}
{"original": "For those closer to the party establishment, and among officials who work closely with Cuomo, the swell of mostly positive attention feels overdue."}
{"original": "Democratic operative Lis Smith, a New York native who became a national political star during her time as former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg's communications guru, worked as Cuomo's rapid response leader during the 2018 gubernatorial campaign."}
{"original": "The coronavirus crisis is a moment that Andrew Cuomo was made for, Smith said."}
{"original": "It turns out that his signature traits -- having a forceful personality, putting results and competence before ideology -- are exactly what's needed for handling a global pandemic, she said, echoing some of the 2018 campaign's top talking points. He might not yell the loudest, stake out the furthest left position on the ideological spectrum, or deliver zingers on cable news, but he knows how to be an executive and how to get things done."}
{"original": "Smith said her family and friends have began texting her constantly during his press conferences, which she described as must-see TV, even for non-political junkies."}
{"original": "I knew it was becoming a 'thing' when I got back to New York last weekend and a total stranger used a Cuomo press briefing to break the ice as we were waiting for the elevator, she said."}
{"original": "David Turner, a top operative at the Democratic Governors Association, said he has been struck by how Cuomo has used direct, basic information to convey competency, using things like PowerPoint to get his message out clearly."}
{"original": "Turner described Cuomo's message as: This is a crisis, here is how we are handling it, here is what are the knowns and here are the unknowns and we need to prepare for worst case scenario."}
{"original": "Even if they don't agree, they appreciate it, Turner said."}
{"original": "Beyond communication, though, Turner said Cuomo is demonstrating his vast knowledge of government in this time of need."}
{"original": "He understands how to pull the levers of government, Turner said. His entire life's work led to this moment."}
{"original": "By Saturday morning, Cuomo was back on television. This time out he put a special emphasis on the young people who were not fully complying with orders to stay at home, instead flocking to New York parks:"}
{"original": "You shouldn't be endangering your own, Cuomo said. But you certainly have no right to endanger someone else's."}
{"original": "He echoed the same message Sunday, saying their actions are a mistake."}

{"original": "Amid so much economic suffering and despair, when many Americans have lost faith in their government -- and when millions are prepared to accept lies about the outcome of the 2020 presidential election -- it is imperative that Democrats pass a bold and aggressive economic agenda within the first 100 days of Joe Biden's presidency. Now is not the time to think small. It is the time to think big and to restore faith among working families -- Black, White, Latino, Asian American and Native American -- that in a democratic society, government can respond to their needs."}
{"original": "Failure to adequately respond to the economic desperation in America today will undermine the Biden administration and likely lead Democrats to lose their thin majorities in the US House of Representatives and US Senate in 2022. Democrats suffered significant loses in 1994 , two years after President Bill Clinton's victory -- and, in 2010 , two years after President Barack Obama's victory."}
{"original": "We must not repeat those mistakes."}
{"original": "The danger we face would not be in going too big or spending too much but in going too small and leaving the needs of the American people behind. If Republicans would like to work with us, we should welcome them. But their support is not necessary. In 2010, Sen. Mitch McConnell was willing to sabotage the economy to advantage Republicans, doing everything he could to make Obama a one-term president."}
{"original": "We cannot let him play the same games again."}
{"original": "The Senate's 60-vote threshold to pass major legislation has become an excuse for inaction. But let's be clear: We have the tools to overcome these procedural hurdles. As incoming Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I will use a process known as budget reconciliation that will allow us to pass comprehensive legislation with only 51 votes."}
{"original": "This is not a radical idea."}
{"original": "When the Republicans controlled the Senate during the George W. Bush and Trump presidencies, they used reconciliation to pass trillions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthiest people and most profitable corporations. They also used reconciliation to try and repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017. Today, Democrats must use this same process to lift Americans out of poverty, increase wages and create good-paying jobs."}
{"original": "First, we must increase the direct payments passed by Congress in December from $600 to $2,000 for every working-class adult and their children. On this issue, Joe Biden, Donald Trump, incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, several Republicans in the House and the Senate and undoubtedly millions of struggling Americans -- who wanted more stimulus in December --would agree."}
{"original": "But given the enormous crises facing the country, that is not enough. Through reconciliation, we must pass a major Covid-relief package that expands emergency unemployment benefits to $600 a week, provides aid to state and local governments to prevent mass layoffs, enacts hazard pay for frontline workers, saves the US Postal Service, addresses the crisis of homelessness and ensures that no one in America goes hungry or is evicted."}
{"original": "During the crisis, we must provide emergency health care to all by requiring Medicare to pay the medical bills of the uninsured and under-insured. We must fully fund Covid-19 testing, tracing and vaccine distribution. At a time when our primary care health care system is faltering, and when millions have no medical home, we must also substantially increase funding for community health centers and the National Health Service Corps, which provides scholarships and forgive student debt of medical professionals who agree to work in underserved areas."}
{"original": "Through reconciliation, we must make sure that unemployment benefits during this crisis period are not taxable so that workers don't get hit with a huge tax bill they didn't expect on April 15."}
{"original": "Moreover, we need to create millions of good paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure -- our roads, bridges, sidewalks, schools, water systems and affordable housing. Further, as we lead the world in combating the existential threat of climate change, we can create millions more jobs by making massive investments in wind, solar, geothermal, electric vehicles, weatherization and energy storage."}
{"original": "We must guarantee at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave and end the international embarrassment of the United States as the only high-income nation that fails to provide paid maternity leave."}
{"original": "In order to address our dysfunctional early childhood education system, we must provide universal pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old in the country and greatly expand childcare. And, if we are to have the best-educated workforce in the world, we need to make public colleges and universities tuition free and cancel all student debt for working-class Americans."}

{"original": "In this extraordinarily difficult moment, poll after poll has shown that the American people want government to respond aggressively to address the crises they face. The job of Congress now is to listen to the American people, move our country boldly forward on a path to economic success and show voters that Democrats are prepared to do everything possible to improve their lives."}

{"original": "Now it begins. With House Democrats gaining the power to investigate and issue subpoenas, 2019 offers one certainty: The chaos visited on us by Donald Trump is going to get much worse."}
{"original": "Trump got a head start on his 2019 self-pity with a New Year's Eve message that began, While I'm at the White House working, you're out there partying tonight."}
{"original": "The President was home alone, not hobnobbing with the likes of Fabio and Sylvester Stallone at Mar-a-Lago, because he wanted to make a point about staying in Washington during the government shutdown. Of course, it was a shutdown he caused, with a foot-stamping demand for money for a wall along the Mexico border. The same wall he repeatedly promised Mexico would pay for."}
{"original": "Talking about the wall will clearly be one of Trump's go-to tactics for deflecting attention from the 17 known investigations into his administration, family and his business. Having won election by stirring up hate and fear of immigrants, Trump can be counted on to keep fearmongering – at a higher decibel – as special counsel Robert Mueller, prosecutors around the country and Congressional committees issue reports and subpoenas and demands for documents."}
{"original": "Lies have formed the base of Trump's campaign and administration. His endless and willful falsehoods have corroded the foundation of trust necessary for civil society. Even when they make him look ridiculous, they make a mess of political life, as his supporters cling to his deceptions as a substitute for what is verifiably real."}
{"original": "The President increased his rate of lying in 2018. The Washington Post counted an average of 15 lies per day last year, which was triple his record for 2017."}
{"original": "The surge of Trump's lies appeared to roughly correspond with bad news from federal courthouses and the press. In 2018, he learned his one-time campaign manager, Paul Manafort, is going to prison and his former lawyer and self-described fixer, Michael Cohen, was cooperating with those investigating the 2016 Trump campaign and a great many related issues."}
{"original": "Then came the 2018 midterms, which saw Democrats seize control of the House. Chaos intensified. Top candidates for the chief of staff job dropped out of the running, Defense Secretary James Mattis quit, the Trump shutdown sent the stock market tumbling and even loyal Fox News began to question the President's judgment."}
{"original": "Social science suggests that Trump may become more dishonest in 2019, because he is likely becoming inured to the effects of what he's doing. People become desensitized to bad behavior in the same way perfume wearers lose the aroma and apply more. Serious liars tell more and greater lies as time passes."}
{"original": "The supply of bad news and criticism that seems to provoke Trump's worst behavior will surely explode in 2019. With Sen. Elizabeth Warren getting ready to enter the Democratic presidential race and more contenders coming, the broadsides at Trump will be more numerous and powerful. On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who already flummoxed Trump in a White House meeting on the budget, will immediately push through legislation funding the government, forcing Trump to truly own the shutdown."}
{"original": "She is also likely to unleash five fierce committee chairs who are expected to begin investigations and hearings to hold Trump to account."}
{"original": "Among the Democrats with the power to torment Trump are two he has gleefully insulted: Adam Schiff, who will head the intelligence committee, and Maxine Waters of the Financial Services Committee."}
{"original": "Waters will hold the power to subpoena Trump's tax returns, which he has kept secret. Schiff's intelligence committee will be able to probe a host of controversies that Republicans have ignored, including possible links between Trump's 2016 campaign and Moscow, and the President's business dealings abroad."}
{"original": "Three other House committees are poised to make Donald Trump sweat over issues such as his administration's treatment of asylum-seekers, including two children who recently died in US custody, and various scandals in government agencies and departments. These issues will fall under the purview of the House oversight committee, and its incoming chairman, Elijah Cummings, has sent the administration more than 50 letters seeking information on troublesome issues."}
{"original": "Cummings and his fellow Democrats in the House will also possess the power of impeachment, which, if exercised, would result in a referral to the Senate for a trial that could force Trump from office. Thus far, Democrats don't seem likely to move for impeachment, but this could change if Mueller's investigators produce court filings or a report that implicates the President in the Russian interference in the 2016 election."}

Whether Mueller's report will be made public is an open question – but if it's not, Congress could use its power to put at least some of what the special counsel is discovering into the public domain. This should transpire in the coming year."}
{"original": "As the central figure in the nation's effort to deal with Trump's deceptions, lies and possible crimes, Mueller has been on the receiving end of the President's tantrums ever since he began work. If – likely when – his work product is ultimately revealed, he will have his say, and the President is likely to make us all soon look back and think that 2018 was nothing compared with what Trump's doing now."}

{"original": "Life insurance may not be one of the most glamorous purchases you can make, but it's a necessary one for many Americans. After all, life insurance coverage may be the only source of financial protection for your family if you pass away during your working years. Without coverage, your spouse and dependents could easily struggle to pay your final expenses, let alone get by without your income for years to come."}
{"original": "But because there are so many different types of life insurance, searching for a policy can be downright overwhelming — yet failing to buy life insurance could easily leave your family in a dire situation when you're no longer there to help."}
{"original": "So if you don't already have life insurance, you should consider whether it makes sense for you to be covered. And if you're in the market for a new life insurance policy, our guide will help you explore the different types of insurance that are available, depending on your budget, needs and goals."}
{"original": "For the most part, many people could benefit from having some sort of life insurance coverage in place. In particular, most experts agree that adults with careers and kids should really have a significant amount of coverage in case the worst happens."}
{"original": "But Americans haven't necessarily gotten the memo. In fact, a 2020 Insurance Barometer Study from Limra, an insurance and financial services research association, shows that the number of people with life insurance in the United States has fallen nine percentage points to 54% over the last 10 years."}
{"original": "The experts at Limra note that this trend could be due to a broad drop in employer-based group life insurance benefits. However, the result is the same — fewer people with life insurance coverage means fewer families are afforded this type of financial protection."}
{"original": "If you're unsure whether you need life insurance, here are some of the reasons you may want to buy coverage:"}
{"original": "Income replacement : At its core, life insurance is designed to provide replacement of your income once you're gone. This can be crucial if you have a spouse and/or dependents who are relying on you during your working years."}
{"original": "Coverage for other financial obligations : If you have a mortgage, a car loan, credit card debt or other financial obligations, the proceeds from a life insurance policy can be used to pay off your debts. Without it, your family could be left figuring out how to liquidate your assets or pay your bills after you're gone."}
{"original": "Final expense coverage : According to the : According to the National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA) , the median cost of a funeral with burial and viewing (without the cost of a vault) was $7,640 in 2019. Without life insurance coverage, your family could struggle to cover these final expenses."}
{"original": "Better rates and eligibility when you're young: If you're young and healthy, now's the time to buy life insurance since you'll qualify for lower rates. And if you wait to buy coverage and your health deteriorates, you may not even qualify for coverage later on."}
{"original": "When should you skip life insurance? Most experts agree there are situations where you may not need life insurance at all. If you're young and debt-free and you don't have any dependents, it's possible you may not need this important coverage. The same can be said if your kids are grown and you have plenty of assets, or if you're already retired and no longer need to replace a lost income."}

{"original": "As you shop for and compare life insurance policies, you should know about the many types of life insurance out there. Policies exists for every budget, whether you just need cheap life insurance coverage for your working years or you're a high-net-worth individual who wants to pass on tax-free income to your heirs."}
{"original": "Keep in mind that most types of life insurance require applicants to go through a medical exam. This physical is used to determine your general level of health, as well as how much you'll pay in premiums."}
{"original": "While there are types of life insurance that don't require an exam, favorable results from a medical checkup can help you secure lower premiums or afford a higher level of coverage, so you shouldn't shy away from taking one. With that being said, some individuals in especially good health or at a young age may be able to qualify for no exam life insurance at a relatively reasonable price."}
{"original": "Let's break down the various types of life insurance you may want to consider and explore which type may be best for you."}
{"original": "Term life insurance is the most basic type of life insurance coverage, but that doesn't mean it's any less valuable. With term life insurance, you'll typically pay a fixed premium in exchange for a fixed amount of coverage for a specific term or period, usually 10 to 30 years. If you pass away during the term of your policy, your family is paid the amount of your fixed death benefit."}
{"original": "Because term life insurance coverage has a start date and an end date, this type of protection is typically the least expensive to buy. However, once your term ends, you won't have any coverage. Also, there are different variants of term life insurance coverage you can choose from, including return-of-premium policies that let you get your premiums back when your policy ends, or term coverage you can convert to permanent life insurance later on."}
{"original": "Best for: People who need a considerable amount of income protection during their working years and those buying life insurance on a budget."}
{"original": "Whole life insurance is a type of coverage that is permanent, meaning your policy lasts for your lifetime. While whole life is more expensive than term life insurance, the lifetime benefit that whole life offers can provide consumers with more peace of mind."}
{"original": "Like term life insurance, premiums on whole life insurance generally stay the same throughout the policy, and your beneficiaries receive a guaranteed fixed benefit amount at your death (provided you make on-time payments on your policy for its duration). But whole life insurance also comes with a cash value component, which many companies tout as a savings account of sorts that you can borrow against while you're alive."}
{"original": "Best for: People who are willing to pay more in premiums for a death benefit that lasts for life, as well as potential cash value from their insurance policy."}
{"original": "Universal life insurance is another type of permanent coverage that combines a death benefit with a cash value component. Customers with universal life can rely on the cash value of their policy for a loan, but they can also withdraw funds over time. The cash value also earns interest that's based on market rates, which means the amount of interest you can earn will fluctuate."}
{"original": "This type of coverage also comes with some flexibility when it comes to your premiums. For example, you may be able to use the cash value of your policy to adjust how much you pay in premiums each month, or to cover your premiums altogether."}
{"original": "Some companies allow policyholders to adjust the death benefit on universal life insurance policies over time if you remain in good health. This can be useful if you want to increase your benefit amount as your family expands (though it requires paying a higher premium), or reduce it and pay a lower premium when your children are grown and your replacement income needs are less."}
{"original": "Best for: People who want permanent life insurance with a cash component and flexibility in their premiums and death benefit over time."}
{"original": "Save money when you buy life insurance with QuoteWizard by LendingTree."}
{"original": "PHOTO: iStock Premiums from a variable life insurance policy are invested, with the cash value and death benefit rising or falling based on the results."}
{"original": "Variable life insurance is another type of permanent coverage that comes with a death benefit and a savings component. The main difference is that the premiums on variable life policies are typically invested by your insurance company in stocks, bonds and money market funds, with the goal of receiving a higher return."}
{"original": "Because of the investment component of variable life insurance, this type of coverage is generally seen as more risky. However, taking on more risk offers the opportunity for potentially higher returns. If the underlying investments within your variable life policy perform well, you may see the cash value of your policy and your death benefit increase substantially."}
{"original": "Best for: People who want the option to grow the death benefit and cash value of their insurance policy over time through investments."}
{"original": "Group life insurance can come in many different forms, and it may include any type of life insurance coverage. The main difference is group life insurance is marketed and sold to an entire group at once — usually a cohort of employees at a company. Typically speaking, this means the group can get coverage without individual medical exams."}
{"original": "Depending on where you work, you may get group life insurance coverage extended to you for free as an employee benefit. However, the benefit amount is typically on the smaller side, so if you need a higher level of protection, you'll want to supplement any group life insurance coverage with other coverage. You're also likely to lose any group life coverage you have if and when you switch jobs."}
{"original": "Best for: Group life insurance can be valuable for anyone who receives it as part of their job benefits through work or a membership organization."}
{"original": "Where group life insurance is typically offered through an employer, supplemental life insurance is any additional life insurance you can buy to boost your coverage. Typically speaking, supplemental life insurance coverage is paid for by employees via payroll deduction."}
{"original": "One interesting benefit of supplemental life insurance is the fact that, like group coverage, employees can often bypass taking a medical exam and still qualify for a policy."}
{"original": "Best for: People who want to pay an added premium to increase the amount of coverage they receive through work or a membership organization."}
{"original": "PHOTO: iStock A family life insurance policy covers various family members with appropriately different types of coverage under one policy."}
{"original": "The term family life insurance can mean many things, including any combination of policies that cover an entire family. However, some specific family life insurance policies are extended to provide comprehensive coverage for every member of a family structure."}
{"original": "Family life insurance policies typically include whole life coverage for the main breadwinner of the family as well as term life insurance coverage for their spouse and children. Policies usually include different benefit amounts on different members of the family so that you have appropriate coverage depending on which member of the family were to pass away."}
{"original": "Best for: Families who want tiered protection for each family member based on their income (if any), risk of loss and other factors."}
{"original": "Guaranteed life insurance is a type of coverage you cannot be denied for regardless of your health. Of course, the fact that you'll be approved no matter what makes guaranteed life insurance much more expensive than other similar policies. Further, guaranteed life insurance can come with other downsides, like a decreasing death benefit over time."}
{"original": "Because guaranteed life insurance is available to anyone who applies and pays the premiums, this type of coverage may only provide a death benefit large enough to cover your final expenses."}
{"original": "Best for: People in poor health who want to cover their final expenses but cannot get approved for other types of life insurance."}
{"original": "While most life insurance policies require you to take a medical exam before you get approved for coverage, no exam life insurance is afforded to individuals in excellent health. Providers are able to offer no exam life insurance based on complex computer algorithms that show which consumers are at a low risk of early death based on their age and other factors."}
{"original": "Generally speaking, no exam life insurance comes in the form of term life insurance. But because no medical exam is required, you may pay higher premiums than you would with an underwritten policy and a standard medical checkup."}
{"original": "Best for: Young and healthy individuals who want term coverage without the hassle of a medical exam."}

{"original": "How much life insurance do you need?"}
{"original": "When it comes to actually purchasing a life insurance policy, most consumers wind up asking the same important questions: How much life insurance do I need, and how long do I need my policy to last?"}
{"original": "At the end of the day, only you can decide if you want life insurance coverage in place until the day you die or only for a specific term. However, the price of different types of life insurance coverage may ultimately help make this choice for you. After all, permanent life insurance premiums can easily set you back 10 times more than term life insurance coverage in the same amount."}
{"original": "Generally speaking, you'll want to make sure you have enough life insurance coverage to replace most of your income during your working years. Or, if you prefer, you can follow the rule of thumb that says you should purchase a minimum of 10 times your income in life insurance protection (so $1 million in life insurance if you earn $100,000 per year)."}
{"original": "As you spend time comparing different policies and deciding how much coverage to buy, you may want to consider the following factors:"}
{"original": "How much you earn each year, including salary and bonuses."}
{"original": "Health insurance benefits and other perks your employer offers that would need to be paid for after your death."}
{"original": "Debts that your estate would be responsible for after you're gone, including any personally guaranteed business loans, a mortgage, car loans and other obligations."}
{"original": "How many working years you have left before retirement."}
{"original": "Whether you want to pass an inheritance to your heirs."}
{"original": "The cost of your final expenses and disposition."}
{"original": "Whether you want an insurance benefit to cover the cost of college tuition, family weddings and other major life events after you're gone."}
{"original": "PHOTO: iStock Life insurance is an important financial tool that can make sure your family is taken care of after you're gone."}
{"original": "Most people should have some type of life insurance protection in place, even if coverage is only enough to cover their final expenses. After all, your dependents and other family members will be left to pay your funeral costs and other final expenses once you pass away. Without life insurance, this could create hardship and stress on them at a time when your loved ones will be grieving your passing."}
{"original": "Still, many individuals and families make the choice to buy enough life insurance coverage to replace their entire income during their working years, and potentially their entire lifetime. Consumers typically do so in order to make sure their remaining loved ones don't have to struggle if they pass away, and that dependents can continue their current standard of living. With enough life insurance, you may even be able to leave a legacy for your heirs."}
{"original": "Fortunately, life insurance — and especially term life insurance — doesn't have to be expensive. In fact, based on our research, right now a 30-year-old man in excellent health could purchase 20 years of term life insurance worth $500,000 for less than $27 per month, and a woman at the same age and in the same health could buy this coverage for less than $21 per month."}
{"original": "Regardless of the type of life insurance you may want to buy, your best bet is taking steps to apply now — as in today. The older you get, the more expensive life insurance becomes. So don't let life slip away before your family is protected, or you could easily regret it."}

We are committed to praying for Bristol and her husband-to-be and the entire Palin family as they walk through a very private matter in the eyes of the public."}
{"original": "Evangelical leader Richard Land also backed Palin completely."}
{"original": "This is the pro-life choice. The fact that people will criticize her for this shows the astounding extent to which the secular critics of the pro-life movement just don't get it, Land said in a statement."}
{"original": "Those who criticize the Palin family don't understand that we don't see babies as a punishment but as a blessing. Barack Obama said that if one of his daughters made a mistake and got pregnant out of wedlock, he wouldn't want her to be punished with a child. Pro-lifers don't see a child as punishment."}
{"original": "The immediate support of these major figures, who offered universal praise for the Palins' actions after learning their daughter was pregnant, provides the filter through which conservative Christian voters will process the development. iReport.com: Were you married at a young age?"}

{"original": "We have always encouraged the parents to love and support their children and always advised the girls to see their pregnancies through, even though there will of course be challenges along the way. That is what the Palins are doing, and they should be commended once again for not just talking about their pro-life and pro-family values, but living them out even in the midst of trying circumstances."}
{"original": "Being a Christian does not mean you're perfect. Nor does it mean your children are perfect.

President Trump's moves to gut greenhouse gas regulations were applauded by many in the fossil fuel industry, but coal jobs continued to decline on his watch."}
{"original": "Much of the environmental protections that Trump dismantled can be rebuilt by the incoming Biden administration, experts say."}
{"original": "The most lasting part of Trump's climate legacy -- and one that cannot be undone -- may be the time the administration wasted in the face of a worsening climate crisis, some scientists and experts say."}
{"original": "I'm kind of hopeful that many of the worst and most damaging climate policies are capable of being reversed, said Kim Cobb, a professor and climate scientist at Georgia Tech's School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. But the lost years in terms of progress on emissions reductions we can't ever take back, and that is something that will have a finite impact on coming climate change impacts."}
{"original": "In the face of a mounting climate crisis, Trump doubled down on fossil fuels"}
{"original": "Trump's deregulatory crusade began with his first EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general who had sued the agency a dozen times over environmental protections before being tabbed to lead it."}
{"original": "After he resigned in the face of multiple ethics scandals , Trump picked a former coal lobbyist, Andrew Wheeler, to take his place."}
{"original": "EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler testifies at a Senate hearing on May 20, 2020. Wheeler and former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt executed a massive rollback of climate and environmental regulations during Trump's four years in office."}
{"original": "They took industry's wish lists and translated them into agency orders or regulations, said Michael Gerrard, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School. They were only partially successful because they were so sloppy in following the necessary procedures that they were often slapped down by the courts."}
{"original": "In an interview this week with the Washington Post, Wheeler defended his legacy, saying that on his watch the EPA has proven that you can reduce pollution and have cost-effective regulations."}
{"original": "But critics see a willful and costly ignorance of science, one that has colored the administration's response to the world's biggest crises, from the Covid-19 pandemic to climate change."}
{"original": "I think their [policies] are dangerous. That's the bottom line, Cobb said. I think it's even worse than anti-science."}
{"original": "Preliminary estimates by the private data analytics firm the Rhodium Group show US emissions did plummet by 10% last year, the largest drop since World War II . But experts attribute most of the reduction to the pandemic, which kept many Americans out of their cars and off planes, and expect emissions to rebound as the effects of Covid-19 wane."}
{"original": "Trump's moves also coincided with a seemingly unending rash of extreme weather events, which brought the destruction fueled by global warming to the doorsteps of millions of Americans."}
{"original": "The Glass Fire burns in Calistoga, California on September 28, 2020. An unprecedented fire season in the American West in 2020 was just one of an onslaught of climate-related disasters that have swept the country in recent years."}

That same year, Hurricanes Maria, Harvey and Irma left behind a wake of death and destruction from Puerto Rico to Texas, a year that saw all disasters in the US cause a record $321 billion in damages"}
{"original": "In 2020, a record-breaking 22 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters -- including unprecedented wildfires in the American West -- caused a total of $95 billion in damages across the country."}
{"original": "Why the Trump presidency could influence global warming for years"}
{"original": "During Trump's presidency, global average temperatures have also continued to climb. The last six years have been the hottest six years ever recorded , with 2020 tying 2016 as the hottest year."}
{"original": "Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations also climbed to a new high in 2020, reaching levels unseen in millions of years"}
{"original": "And because of how long greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere, the Trump presidency could influence global warming for years to come."}
{"original": "Global temperature data shows that 2020 was tied for the hottest year on record, according to the Copernicus Climate Service and other monitors."}
{"original": "When humans burn fossil fuels, it sends heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air, where it accumulates in the atmosphere like a blanket, and can stay to heat the Earth for hundreds of years."}
{"original": "Some studies have tried to quantify how much of a contribution Trump's regulatory rollbacks will make over time to accelerating global warming."}
{"original": "One estimate published last year by the Rhodium Group found that the administration's moves to weaken greenhouse gas regulations could add the equivalent of 1.8 gigatons of CO2 to the atmosphere by 2035 , equaling nearly one-third of all US emissions in 2019."}
{"original": "However, there was a bit of good news hidden in the massive Covid-19 relief package that passed last December and which Trump signed."}
{"original": "Buried in the $900 billion stimulus package were some significant climate legislation which calls for phasing out the use of hydrofluorocarbons -- a class of super heat-trapping gases used in refrigerators and air conditioners -- and an extension of a carbon capture technology tax credit for industry."}
{"original": "Over time, analysts say those line items could go a long way toward negating the emissions impact of Trump's rollbacks."}
{"original": "We estimate that this is one of the single biggest climate actions the U.S. has taken in at least in a decade, said Kate Larsen, the director of the Rhodium Group's international energy and climate research team. When you look at the remaining policy rollbacks that Trump implemented and that will remain standing, these are largely equivalent to making up the damage that the Trump administration has done in terms of regulatory rollbacks."}
{"original": "Repairing America's credibility on climate will take time ... and more than just words"}
{"original": "Still, the long-term impact of Trump's other major climate moves is harder to quantify."}
{"original": "Chief among those is the US' exit from the Paris Agreement on climate, which was completed last November"}
{"original": "Leaving Paris marked the second time the US has bailed on an international climate agreement after it led the negotiations. The first exit was from the Kyoto Protocol , a previous climate pact which the US signed during the Clinton administration, only to drop out during George W. Bush's presidency."}
{"original": "President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin the Paris Agreement on Day One of his presidency, but experts say repairing the damage to the country's international standing that was done by Trump abandoning the accord will not be easy."}
{"original": "President Trump announced his decision to pull the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement on June 1, 2017, but the exit was not finalized until November 2020."}
{"original": "In one sense, it's easy for President Biden to announce on the first day he's in office that the US will rejoin, said Jody Freeman, a Harvard law professor who served as counselor for energy and climate change in the White House under President Barack Obama. The hard part is to put together an ambitious, credible pledge for what the US is prepared to do to meet their Paris Agreement commitments."}
{"original": "Trump's interior department also cleared the way for new fossil fuel extraction on federal lands, including in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), one of the country's largest remaining pristine wildlife areas"}
{"original": "Though there was ultimately little interest in the rights to drill in ANWR from bidders , experts say it could be difficult for the Biden administration and environmental groups to challenge those leases."}
{"original": "Once the lease has been sold, it creates a property right, Gerrard said. There will be litigation about whether the leases were validly issued, but if any of them are upheld in court, it becomes more difficult to revoke them."}
{"original": "Biden faces a bumpy road to erasing Trump's climate legacy"}
{"original": "Throughout the campaign and the transition period, Biden has made it clear that he intends to try and make a complete 180-degree turn on federal climate policy."}
{"original": "He appointed former Secretary of State John Kerry to a new Cabinet-level position as special climate envoy , where he will have a seat on the National Security Council, and has tapped other Obama administration alums to join his climate team."}
{"original": "During the presidential campaign, he unveiled a $2 trillion climate plan that calls for the US to reach 100% clean electricity generation by 2035, and make huge investments in green infrastructure, from expanding wind and solar to power generation to building a nationwide electric car-charging network."}
{"original": "Experts say there is plenty of opportunity for his administration to push through parts of his plan to reduce US greenhouse gas emissions and to inspire action internationally."}
{"original": "Trump took a wrecking ball to the nation's environmental regulations, Gerrard said. Fortunately, it's not Humpty Dumpty, and most of it can be put back together again."}
{"original": "President-elect Joe Biden speaks during an event to introduce key members of his climate team in Wilmington, Delaware on December 19, 2020. Biden's climate plan calls for the US to generate 100% of its electricity from clean energy sources by 2035."}
{"original": "But the need to reverse moves finalized by his predecessor and the political realities of a razor-thin Democratic Senate majority could hamper Biden's more ambitious climate proposals."}
{"original": "Some of Trump's rollbacks can be undone with the stroke of a pen or overturned by a simple majority in both houses of Congress through the Congressional Review Act, Gerrard said."}
{"original": "Others like reinstating or tightening the Obama-era standards on car and truck emissions can be accomplished through EPA rulemaking, but the process takes time -- anywhere from a few months to a year, Gerrard said."}
{"original": "Youth-led climate action organizations like the Sunrise Movement have indicated that they intend to hold the new administration accountable for delivering on Biden's climate promises."}
{"original": "And a newly-minted Democratic Senate majority will open the door to some legislative opportunities that wouldn't have been possible in a chamber controlled by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell."}
{"original": "Still, climate policy experts say that the narrow Senate majority will force Biden to find measures that can garner bipartisan support -- like spending on green infrastructure -- in the vein of the climate legislation that passed in the end-of-year Covid-19 stimulus package."}
{"original": "When the Senate is sort of evenly split, the type of progress we're going to make on climate is not going to look like comprehensive climate legislation, Larsen said. It's going to be these targeted wins on things that can largely get bipartisan support."}
{"original": "But whatever progress Biden's administration is able to make on halting climate change over the next four years, some say the lost time of the last four years will still loom large."}
{"original": "The primary effect is that the new administration will be occupied for its first couple of years with reversing all the damage rather than continuing to make progress, said Ted Lamm, a senior research fellow at the Center for Law, Energy and the Environment at the University of California-Berkeley. Particularly in the case of climate change, where we are facing a ticking clock, that lost time is potentially disastrous and harmful."}
{"original": "More Americans are finding work. That's great news, and stocks soared Wednesday morning, thanks to it. But the Federal Reserve threw some cold water on the bulls by the end of the day."}

{"original": "But the market pulled back and gave up nearly all of its gains by the end of the day after minutes from the Federal Reserve showed that some members of the central bank felt that stocks were quite high."}
{"original": "Still, more jobs gains could help the market. And ADP said that 263,000 jobs were added in March, well ahead of forecasts for about 175,000."}
{"original": "Both ADP and the government reported solid jobs gains for February. So investors appear to be banking that the momentum in the labor market will continue."}
{"original": "Despite Wednesday's topsy-turvy trading, the market appears to be back on solid footing after a recent dip following President Trump's failure to push forward on a deal to repeal and replace Obamacare."}

{"original": "If you're hoping to buy a home in Seattle, be prepared for rejection."}
{"original": "Homes frequently sell for well over asking and receive multiple offers."}
{"original": "For buyers, we are typically making six to 10 offers before we get a house, said Rob McGarty, who has been a real estate agent in Seattle for 14 years. The amount of emotional energy going into preparing these offers is huge."}
{"original": "Home prices in Seattle are on fire: rising nearly 13% in February from the same time a year ago, according to the latest S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices."}
{"original": "Prices have risen so fast that it's led to an affordability crisis, with no relief in site."}
{"original": "Seattle seems to be defying all the laws of housing market trends, said Daren Blomquist, senior vice president at real estate data firm ATTOM."}
{"original": "Related: Home prices are on an epic run"}
{"original": "The problem is simple: there are more people looking to buy homes than there are homes available for sale."}
{"original": "Seattle's population has been rapidly growing recently thanks in part to its large homegrown businesses like Amazon (AMZN) and Starbucks (SBUX)."}
{"original": "Amazon in particular has played a major role in Seattle's economic growth and strength. The company employs more than 40,000 workers at its Seattle headquarters and pays out nearly $26 billion in compensation."}
{"original": "Amazon has amassed a huge talent pool of employees that has caused other companies to open offices here, said McGarty. We have a ton of [San Francisco] Bay area companies that now have offices in Seattle ... those transplants have driven prices up."}
{"original": "Home values in King County, which is where Amazon is located, have appreciated twice as fast as the national average, according to Blomquist. Average annual home price appreciation from 1995 (when Amazon first launched) to 2018 was 6%, according to ATTOM. Over the same time period, the national average was just 3%."}
{"original": "After months of online searching, open houses and having several offers rejected, Kayela Robertson and her husband, Cody, had hit their limit."}
{"original": "She said it was common to see the homes they lost out on go on to sell for at least $100,000 over the asking price with multiple offers. They were about to expand their search radius when they made their seventh offer."}
{"original": "If we were going to be in Seattle, we had joked that we needed to get this house. This was the make it or break it offer, she said. If we didn't, I would have to cave and move farther out."}
{"original": "Fortunately, their seventh offer was accepted. To close the deal, they offered $140,000 more than the list price of $590,000. They also dropped all contingencies, included an escalation clause, put $100,000 in escrow and promised to close within two weeks."}
{"original": "Related: Looking to buy your first home? Good luck with that"}
{"original": "The couple sold their home in Spokane in January for full asking price, and the money from the sale helped make their offer competitive. They closed on the new home a month ago."}
{"original": "The house we sold was much nicer and bigger and was much less [than the Seattle home], Robertson said. It is still an adjustment that we are paying more than two times more for this house."}
{"original": "Despite being a seller's market, Seattle homeowners are hesitant to sell."}
{"original": "Last year, the city was among the best markets to sell a home, and the average home seller return on investment was 64%, according to ATTOM. But even if they get a good price, sellers are struggling to find a home to trade up to."}
{"original": "While the demand is clearly there, there's only so much room to build in Seattle. It's bounded by water and mountains."}
{"original": "The city also has strict regulations when it comes to building apartment and condos, and 70% of the land mass in the city is zoned for single family homes, according to Matthew Gardner, chief economist at Windermere Real Estate."}
{"original": "We aren't very dense at all, he said."}
{"original": "The home affordability problem could make the city less appealing to businesses. The city recently passed a new tax on big businesses that will help pay for affordable housing and fight homelessness."}
{"original": "At some point, the housing affordability issues and high cost of living, plus the new business tax, could cause companies to think twice about starting or expanding in Seattle."}
{"original": "The two most important things when companies think about growing in a market is whether there is a suitable talent pool and how much they have to pay people, and the biggest part of salary is the local cost of living, said Gardner."}
{"original": "Investors should watch out for three big risks as they enter into the second half of the year."}
{"original": "On CNNMoney's Markets Now Wednesday, analyst Darius Dale warned about the strengthening dollar, wage growth and a peaking global economy."}
{"original": "There's a lot of negative signals out there that seem to suggest that we're not going to be able to surpass this historically high level of operating margins, Dale, a senior macro analyst with investment research firm Hedgeye Risk Management, told CNNMoney anchor Maggie Lake."}
{"original": "Dale predicts that the pace of economic growth and inflation will slow this year, but he doesn't think a recession is coming soon."}
{"original": "Related: Apple inches closer to $1 trillion market value"}
{"original": "Dale said that investors should avoid consumer staples, the industrial sector, and even some technology companies."}
{"original": "Investors who bet on tech companies that rely on economic strength, like semiconductors, for example, could be making a huge mistake."}
{"original": "Dale also cast doubt on the Trump administration's ability to hit its 3% growth target because companies have been spending savings from their new lower tax rate on stock buybacks, rather than investing in new facilities or research."}

{"original": "H&R Block (HRB)and Liberty Tax (TAX)(which, despite having Liberty in its name, is not one of the gazillion tracking stocks set up by media mogul John Malone) have been the investing equivalent of a tax audit -- something you really don't want."}

{"original": "As you might expect though, Intuit is a much pricier stock than its rivals."}
{"original": "It trades at about 24 times earnings forecasts for its next fiscal year -- more than twice the valuations for both H&R Block and Liberty Tax."}
{"original": "But Intuit may be worth the premium as more and more Americans look to do their own taxes instead of shelling out money to get someone to do it for them."}
{"original": "Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said that Intuit started promoting its services (including free tax filings) more heavily earlier on this year -- and that hurt H&R Block."}
{"original": "Luria conceded that bargain hunters might find H&R Block more attractive than Intuit. It pays a dividend that yields more than 3.3% too, compared to Intuit's yield of just 1.2%."}
{"original": "But Intuit has all the momentum right now. So anybody looking to use their tax refund to buy stocks might be better off investing in Intuit over H&R Block and Liberty."}
{"original": "Buying a home is a major financial undertaking, so much so that a growing number of Americans are struggling to meet that milestone. For one thing, the homeownership rate among Millennials has dropped in recent years, due in part to a limited inventory of starter homes, and also to student debt payments monopolizing so much of younger workers' income."}
{"original": "Gen Xers are having a hard time buying homes as well. Between credit card debt and child care expenses, many workers in their 30s and 40s don't have the funds on hand to take that leap."}
{"original": "The problem, of course, is that those who put off homeownership lose out on key tax breaks for as long as they continue to rent."}
{"original": "If you're looking to become a homeowner, but you're finding it difficult to meet that goal, here are a few tips to make the prospect of buying more affordable."}
{"original": "You might think you don't have much leeway when it comes to saving money each month, but if you're willing to take a long, hard look at your budget, you'll probably come to find that there are some expenses you can manage to cut, whether it's the cable plan you can afford to downgrade or those daily lunches you know you can prepare yourself. Reworking your budget is apt to get you closer to your goal of buying a home, so comb through your expenses line by line and figure out which are less important to you. Then, pledge to reduce or eliminate those spending categories and bank the difference."}
{"original": "Many people think of side hustles as a way to drum up a little extra spending money. But if you're willing to put in the time, that second gig could help you save some serious cash. Among the estimated 44 million U.S. adults who currently have a side hustle, 36% earn over $500 a month from that extra work. And that could help you reach your homeownership goal way faster than by just cutting corners here and there."}
{"original": "It's often the case that you'll get more for your money in the suburbs than in a city. If you're struggling to come up with a down payment that'll buy you more than a shoebox in your local metro area, consider expanding your search perimeter to its surrounding towns. Many suburbs offer convenient public transportation options that allow you to commute to work while enjoying the benefits of cheaper housing and bigger living spaces than what you'd find in a city."}
{"original": "Though having a strong credit score won't help you come up with a down payment, it will help you qualify for the best possible mortgage rate available, thus making the prospect of homeownership more affordable on the whole. Therefore, if your score isn't stellar, it pays to take steps to raise it as quickly as possible."}
{"original": "You can accomplish this in a number of ways. First, make a point to pay all of your bills on time. Secondly, aim to pay down a chunk of whatever outstanding balances you're carrying. This will alter your credit utilization ratio, which is a major component of determining your score. Finally, review your credit report thoroughly for errors. One in five credit reports contains a mistake; correcting yours could send your score into more favorable territory."}
{"original": "Though this should only be used as a last resort, if you're really having a hard time saving for a home but are tired of throwing out money on rent, you have the option to remove up to $10,000 from an existing IRA in order to purchase your first home. Normally, withdrawing funds prior to age 59 and 1/2 would subject you to a 10% penalty, but the IRS allows this exception for first-time homebuyers."}
{"original": "But again, this option is far from ideal, because any time you remove money from an IRA, that's less income you'll have available in retirement. Furthermore, it's not just that principal amount you're losing out on during your golden years, but the growth it could've achieved over time."}
{"original": "Still, if you're desperate, you might choose to take an early withdrawal and make that homeownership dream come true. As a compromise, you might decide that whatever tax savings you glean from owning will go directly into your retirement plan to compensate for the sum you withdrew."}

{"original": "McGovern, gaining 54 in Wisconsin, had a total of 89 1/2, trailed by Wallace with 75 and Humphrey with 19. With the delegate-rich primaries in Pennsylvania (182), Massachusetts (102), New York (278) and California (271) still to come, all the candidates are still far from the 1,509 needed for nomination in Miami Beach. For the moment, Wisconsin seemed to have reduced it to a three-man contest among Muskie, Humphrey and McGovern. Although McGovern now ranks as a heavyweight contender, he must still establish that Wisconsin was not a fluke in which the candidate was secondary to the issues. McGovern displayed surprising strength among labor's rank and file in Wisconsin, but his comparative radicalism and long anti-war record have earned him the hostility of many labor leaders as well as Democratic professionals. If McGovern begins to seem a serious threat, many of the regulars might mount a counterattack in favor of Humphrey. Some Democrats fear that a McGovern candidacy might be the equivalent of Barry Goldwater's campaign in 1964 -- an ideological debacle -- and they are already poor-mouthing his victory on the grounds that his excellent Wisconsin organization and Republican cross-over votes distorted the natural outcome. Scenarios. These primaries, said McGovern last week, are going to go on from state to state, from battle to battle."}

George Wallace planned only a minimal campaign in Wisconsin, where busing was not an issue, and he had virtually no organization. But when he sensed the crowd's mood at his first rally in Milwaukee on March 23, Wallace abruptly changed his schedule. Suddenly all his earlier explanations about our inability to rent halls because of basketball games became academic. Wallace sought his little man with eleven rallies in eight days and a flurry of local television interviews. He repeatedly brought up busing as a philosophical issue. He complained that the other candidates were horning in on his populist issues: I dig the bone up and throw it out there, and the big dogs grab it. I'm just a little dog from Alabama. McGovern's television commercials confirmed the Wallace complaint. If you want lower property taxes, you want George McGovern, said one. It's as simple as that. But McGovern emphasized direct campaigning. In oblique reference to Lindsay's stylish and futile TV campaigns in Florida and Wisconsin, one McGovern press release claimed: The day of the media candidate is over. People have stopped watching television commercials and started listening to details. Top-Heavy. Despite his efforts to sharpen his stand on issues, Muskie failed to come across clearly on any topic. His organization, top-heavy with endorsements and contributors, never took root on the local levels where primaries are won. He failed to define a constituency."}

{"original": "The overall message from Wisconsin is of a contrary mood, an impatience with more traditional candidates and a deep undercurrent of economic dismay. Most specifically, Wisconsin signaled a massive discontent with taxes and inflation -- the pocketbook issues that McGovern and Wallace hit the hardest. In a study of TIME, the attitude research firm of Daniel Yankelovich Inc. found that four of the five top issues that influenced Wisconsin voters were economic. The sixth was the Vietnam War, and McGovern made that into an economic issue as well, emphasizing its continuing costs. According to the survey, 82% of those interviewed said that the Administration's wage and price policies are not working. Fifty-two percent called for overall tax reform, with 41% complaining about high prices and 36% about high unemployment. McGovern and Humphrey both hammered away on the issue of tax reform, of giving the little taxpayer and the working man a fairer break. They shared the rewards: well over half of McGovern's voters and almost two-thirds of Wallace's assailed tax loopholes. The issue cut across both party and ideological grounds, attracting liberals as well as conservatives, Republicans as well as Democrats. The Yankelovich pollsters found a surprising degree of second-choice support for McGovern among the Wallace voters -- support rooted in McGovern's broad anti-Establishment campaign. It was not that Wisconsin voters were running to ideological extremes at the expense of centrist candidates, but rather that both McGovern and Wallace seem to have located an authentic area of concern that the other candidates failed to articulate."}

So said Senator McGovern as he officially hit the campaign trail 15 long months ago -- and all but disappeared into the political wilderness. As the earliest declared candidate for the presidential nomination in recent memory, he had a plan: challenge Edmund Muskie before he built up an insurmountable lead, go all out to make a credible showing in the New Hampshire primary, and then, gathering momentum, overtake the field in Wisconsin. Back then, his strategy seemed dreamy, if not downright doomed. Few political leaders took his candidacy seriously, dismissing him as a self-appointed conscience of the party or a stalking horse for Ted Kennedy. The Margin.

When a broker gets into financial trouble and has to liquidate, SIPC makes sure the assets in each investor's account are present and accounted for. If cash or securities are missing, then the SIPC makes investors whole, up to the dollar limit protected."}

According to the TIME/Yankelovich survey, McGovern trailed both Wallace and Humphrey among blue-collar workers and union members, but he still got 25% of their votes. More than any other, McGovern came through as someone you can trust. Improbably, he won the Fourth Congressional District, on the blue-collar and ethnic south side of Milwaukee, with the largest concentration of Poles in the state. Muskie, who had emphasized his Polish ancestry, finished fourth. Cross-Overs. Wallace and McGovern worked the same vein of economic distress, but the McGovern vote was moderate-liberal, according to the survey, while the Wallace vote was essentially moderate- conservative. McGovern fared well with young voters (47%); Wallace did poorly. The final results were complicated, of course, by the fact that 26% of the votes cast in the Democratic primary came from Republicans and Independents. The cross-overs cost Humphrey a second-place finish, since most of them went to Wallace. Yankelovich found, however, that most of the cross-overs came not as spoilers but as voters anxious to make their views known on the economy and other issues. Wisconsin served to prolong and compound the suspense of the race. It established the major Democratic theme -- a profound economic disgruntlement -- but not a party leader. It's kind of a scramble now, Humphrey said last week. Coming out of Wisconsin, Muskie still led in committed delegate votes, with 96 1/2."}

Accused at a University of Wisconsin rally of being a warmonger for voting for passage of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, McGovern did not turn peevish as Muskie has done in the face of similar baiting. Instead, McGovern asked that those who believed the charge raise their hands; when less than six hands shot up, McGovern moved on to other matters. He has successfully overcome his image as a one-issue peace candidate by promoting his stands on income distribution, tax, reform and decreased defense spending. McGovern projects simplicity, honesty and candor. He remains confident despite the many Democratic leaders who still dismiss his candidacy. Meanwhile, stone by stone, George moves on. What Happened to Muskie? In just one month, Maine's Ed Muskie slipped from the position of the serene front runner to that of an embattled man on the verge of being knocked completely out of the race for his party's nomination for President. Before the plunge, much of the press (including TIME) and many politicians saw him as almost a certain first-ballot winner at the Democratic Convention in July.

Muskie at his best is far more inspiring than Nixon, who does have credibility problems and is unpredictable. Nixon had sounded shrill and unfair as he tried to link Democrats with crime, drugs and antiwar violence during the 1970 congressional campaigns, while Muskie on that election eve effectively deplored such tactics and appealed for a return to reason. Perhaps the voters did long for a calmer, loftier leader. To further the bandwagon psychology, the Muskie strategists won endorsements from big names in the party: California Senator John Tunney, Ohio Governor John Gilligan, Illinois Senator Adlai Stevenson III, Iowa Senator Harold Hughes, Pennsylvania Governor Milton Shapp. Each new name made the nomination seem that much more inevitable. This was organizing the party drive from the top down, rather than from the bottom up. Suddenly, the edifice began to crumble, and the entire strategy was shattered. Democratic voters showed that in primaries, at least, they were not all that concerned about finding a contrast with Nixon. They were not looking for a unifier and mollifier. They were in a balky, grumpy mood. They wanted specific answers to specific problems that plagued them. They were more interested in voting against the status quo, and men like George McGovern and George Wallace seemed to offer that chance to protest."}

{"original": "Moreover Muskie hurt his own image as the judicious, controlled candidate by sobbing in the snows of New Hampshire, ironically at the very time that Nixon in Peking was acting as the healer of international passions. This outburst was partly the result of Muskie's emotional and physical fatigue. Trying to be all things to all people, and torn by his commitments to so many primary campaigns, he lost his sense of direction, creating doubts about his ability to stand up under pressure. Fed Up. Muskie's overconfident staff had also erred badly in ignoring grass-roots organizational work. In a primary, voters have to be coaxed to go to the polls and persuaded to select a particular name out of a crowded field. In New Hampshire, the Muskie camp had to send out-of-state organizers in at the last minute to get out a favorable vote. Muskie now concedes that entering the Florida primary was a mistake; once Wallace had entered, he should have known it was hopeless and avoided that first big blow to his front-running status. He relied heavily for support in Florida upon its Democratic state legislators -- but they were tied down by their duties in Tallahassee and were of little help. Muskie came out of his Florida defeat in a new fighting mood. He tackled specific issues, such as taxes and the economy, and began berating his competitors. Yet the turnabout gave Muskie the impression of a man lashing out in desperation, seeking a new image. Muskie's dilemma is painfully difficult."}

But working Americans are worse off, and the middle class is standing on a trap door. Lincoln once said that ours is to be a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. What we have today is a government of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich. And we're going to make a change in November. Look at the record. Reagan Record First, there was Mr. Reagan's tax program. What happened was, he gave each of his rich friends enough tax relief to buy a Rolls Royce - and then he asked your family to pay for the hub caps. Then they looked the other way at the rip-offs, soaring utility bills, phone bills, medical bills. Then they crimped our future. They let us be routed in international competition, and now the help-wanted ads are full of listings for executives, and for dishwashers - but not much in between. Then they socked it to workers. They encouraged executives to vote themselves huge bonuses - while using King Kong tactics to make workers take Hong Kong wages.

(His principal financial contributors are Max Palevsky, chairman of the Xerox Executive Committee, and Henry Kimelman, board chairman of West Indies Corp.) On the other are legions of young staffers and student volunteers bristling with go-for-George enthusiasm. The spectacle of the old Kennedy pros followed by McGovern's young crusaders, says Eugene McCarthy, is like German officers leading Irish troops. Index Cards. But they march well together. Typical of McGovern's young minions is Gene Pokorny, 26, a scholarly Nebraskan who, says Campaign Manager Gary Hart, has the mind of a revolutionist in the body of Henry Aldrich. Dispatched to Wisconsin a year ago on a salary of $200 a month, he tirelessly crisscrossed the state with clipboard and index cards in hand, organizing and opening 39 McGovern headquarters. When it was discovered that voting day fell during campus spring vacations, Pokorny ran forms in students newspapers which could be exchanged for absentee ballots. By election day an estimated 70% of the students cast their votes for McGovern and the number of workers had grown from 80 to 10,000. McGovern, say staffers, is no softie, despite his easygoing ways.

For Humphrey and Muskie, April 25 will be critical. That is the date of both the Massachusetts and Pennsylvania primaries. Humphrey, badly needing a victory, will count on his support among organized labor for a win in Pennsylvania. Despite Wisconsin, Humphrey's camp insists that McGovern is not really a factor -- This is a race between Humphrey and Muskie. McGovern's advisers, meantime, regard Muskie as a political corpse, seeing the race as a head-on collision between McGovern and Humphrey. Muskie had planned to run in Pennsylvania against Humphrey and in Massachusetts against McGovern, to regain momentum. Last week, however, his advisers were discussing a stop-Humphrey ploy with McGovern's forces -- Muskie would concentrate on winning in Pennsylvania while leaving Massachusetts to McGovern. With each future contest, the political equations will change and the pressures increase. It is now highly likely that after all the bloodshed of the primaries, no one will go to Miami Beach with a lock on the nomination. If so, it will be a fascinating week in July. A deadlock would probably eliminate McGovern as too leftward and experimental, even though that might provoke a fourth-party rebellion.

{"original": "First rebate checks sent to taxpayers WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The federal government mailed out nearly 8 million tax rebate checks Friday, the first wave of about 92 million checks that will be sent out in the next 10 weeks. The checks, which go to millions of Americans who filed a 2000 income tax return, range from a maximum amount of $300 for single filers to $600 for married taxpayers who filed jointly. Single parents will get about $500. In order to get the full amount, a single taxpayer must have had at least $6,000 in taxable income for 2000; $12,000 for a married couple filing jointly. The Internal Revenue Service sent letters to those who would receive rebates earlier this month, explaining that the checks are being sent out based on the last two digits of your Social Security number. The rebates that went out beginning Friday were for people with the last two digits 00-09. The distribution schedule continues through September 24. The rebates -- $38 billion worth -- are the product of President Bush's tax legislation that reduced the base income tax from 15 percent to 10 percent. The reduction is retroactive to January 2001, so what taxpayers are getting is a refund of taxes they have already overpaid this year through federal withholding from their paychecks. To celebrate the mailing of the first checks, Vice President Dick Cheney and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill went to a government check-writing facility in Kansas City, Missouri. Friday."}

I traveled everywhere. It seemed like I had visited every acre of America. It wasn't easy.

Beginning late last summer and early fall, our economy, especially the manufacturing sector, began slowing, he said. The combination of this tax relief and lower interest rates should help get it moving again. Not everyone will get a rebate check. Those who did not file a return last year, those who had no taxable income and those who can be claimed as dependents on someone else's tax return will not qualify. The amount of some taxpayers' checks may be smaller, too, if they owe any back taxes, child support payments or federal loan payments. The government will deduct those debts from rebate checks before sending them. So how will you spend your rebate check, if you're getting one? About 47 percent of those questioned for a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll said they would pay bills with the money, 32 percent will save it, 17 percent will spend it and 2 percent will donate their check to charity.

Others disagree.

{"original": "There was, in fact, a whole series of mistakes made by political pros, journalists, Muskie strategists and Muskie himself. In the first place, he probably should never have been rated so far ahead. That status was based largely on the fact that national surveys showed him to be the Democrat with the best chance to defeat Nixon -- but those polls do not translate into strength in state primaries. Yet that impression of Muskie's popularity had never really been tested in voting booths nationwide. Muskie had looked cool and impressive as Hubert Humphrey's running mate in 1968, and he exuded much more of a presidential aura than did his G.O.P. counterpart, Spiro Agnew. Yet few voters select a President primarily by looking at the vice presidential candidates, and Muskie's appeal was not really an issue in that election. Muskie was now recognized by most Democratic voters all right, but how did they really feel about him? No one could be sure. Euphoric. Nevertheless, Muskie and his advisers almost euphorically accepted the pleasant notion that he was far ahead of the field -- and they designed a campaign based on that assumption. He would speak cautiously, even vaguely, if need be, on most issues, so as not to antagonize any large blocs of voters. Ignoring his rivals for the nomination, he would campaign against the President. The essence of that campaign would be to portray Nixon as an excitable, expedient politician whose statements were rarely credible."}

The Wisconsin primary left the eventual outcome of the long spring campaign more enigmatic than ever, but some of the election results were startling: -- George McGovern, hitherto regarded as a one-issue antiwar champion of the liberal-left, exploited his own superb organization in the state, tapped deep wells of economic discontent and, by winning a 30% plurality, transformed himself at last into a major candidate. In Wisconsin his support was astonishingly broad, bracketing liberals, conservatives, blue- collar workers, farmers, suburbanites and the young. -- George Wallace, with the help of 35% of the G.O.P. voters who crossed over to vote Democratic, similarly appealed to a restive mood of the little man. Although he campaigned for only eight days in Wisconsin, Wallace came in second, with 22% of the vote. Adding the Wallace and McGovern totals, 52% of the voters cast ballots for anti-Establishment candidates. -- Minnesota's Hubert Humphrey, who had counted on his longtime popularity in neighboring Wisconsin to catapult him into the Democratic lead, came in third, with 21%. It was a serious, though by no means fatal blow for Humphrey, who has yet to win a presidential primary."}

Taken singly, the encounters were insignificant; taken together, they meant the margin of victory. Recalls Journalist Harl Andersen, who covered the campaign for the Associated Press: George only builds a stone at a time. After a while, though, it begins to show up. In 1962 he moved on to the Senate, winning a seat by only 597 votes. One of the earliest and most persistent antiwar Senators, McGovern began building a small but strong following with his co- sponsorship of the 1968 McGovern-Hatfield resolution calling for an end to the war. Though unsuccessful, the legislation occasioned a rare flash of fire from the quiet man. Every Senator in this chamber is partly responsible for sending 50,000 young Americans to an early grave. McGovern fumed. This chamber reeks of blood! When Robert Kennedy was assassinated, McGovern sought to keep Bobby's antiwar supporters together by entering the race in his stead less than three weeks before the 1968 convention. Though he polled only 146 1/2 of the 2,622 delegate votes, the effort gave McGovern the presidential bug. The candidate of 1972 has changed little; he is still the personable but plodding campaigner. McGovern's success is a combination of his persistence and a new, high-powered, appealingly unprofessional organization."}

{"original": "-- Edmund Muskie, limping into fourth place with only 10% of the vote, was the real loser. Once regarded as the front runner, Muskie's defeats in Florida and Wisconsin have deflated his trust and confidence campaign. In an almost breathtaking descent, Muskie in a matter of weeks has become merely another contender. At least one candidate did not survive Wisconsin at all. New York Mayor John Lindsay, with a dismal 7% showing on top of his 7% in Florida, declared himself out of the race. A Muskie aide who had earlier called Lindsay the wild card in this campaign remarked last week: He turned out to be a deuce. Washington Senator Henry Jackson, who won 8% in Wisconsin, remained the darkest of horses, suffering from a massive problem of nonrecognition; on primary day last week, his workers were still distributing a leaflet headlined WHO IS SENATOR JACKSON? On the Republican ballot, Richard Nixon was opposed by Ohio's conservative Congressman John Ashbrook, who got 1% of the vote. California's liberal Republican Congressman Paul McCloskey, who had already withdrawn from the race, also got 1%. The President scored 97%. The Wisconsin campaign was a furious montage of political styles. With mod glasses and carefully darkened hair, 61-year-old Humphrey bounced through 19-hour days. We can sleep next year, he told his workers. Everywhere, except among college students, he found deep affection, but the warmth did not always convert to votes. At times, his campaign savored of last hurrah. In Milwaukee, a woman wearing a McGovern button told H.H.H."}

Truth About The Future If this administration has a plan for a better future, they're keeping it a secret. Here is the truth about the future: We are living on borrowed money and borrowed time. These deficits hike interest rates, clobber exports, stunt investment, kill jobs, undermine growth, cheat our kids, and shrink our future. Whoever is inaugurated in January, the American people will have to pay Mr. Reagan's bills. The budget will be squeezed. Taxes will go up. And anyone who says they won't is not telling the truth to the American people. I mean business. By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two-thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did. There's another difference. When he raises taxes, it won't be done fairly. He will sock it to average-income families again, and leave his rich friends alone. And I won't stand for it. And neither will you and neither will the American people. To the corporations and freeloaders who play the loopholes or pay no taxes, my message is: Your free ride is over. To the Congress, my message is: We must cut spending and pay as we go."}
