The number of illegal border crossings is down from 1.6 million in 2000 to less than 400,000 last year. But the number of families coming over the border has risen sharply, putting a strain on health care and immigration services that came into sharp focus with the deaths of two migrant children in December. Administration figures show that 161,000 family units crossed the border in fiscal 2018, a remarkable 50 percent increase from the year before. Homeland Security officials have also said 60,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border last year, a 25 percent increase.

One of the most powerful platforms Donald Trump ran on was his opposition to China. He understood what people in regular America thought about China, what they had seen China doing to regular Americans' jobs over the past three decades that politicians in both parties had ignored for decades.

That is one reason why California has ended up with government debt that is at least $1.3 trillion and may actually be closer $2.3 trillion. The state's pension liability alone is $1 trillion. Plus California is still racking up new liabilities for pet projects like former Governor Jerry Brown's $100 billion high-speed train to nowhere.

If Democrats are successful in the Georgia runoff elections on Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer will have the power to enact the radical left's socialist agenda that has become mainstream in today's Democratic Party. The Green New Deal, socialized medicine with care decided by unaccountable bureaucrats in Washington, European-style taxes on American industry and workers, radical regulations that will harm small businesses, and capitulation to the Chinese Communist Party will all be on the agenda.

HERMAN CAIN (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't think it is an opening for president Trump to woo black voters because President Trump is trying to woo the United States of America. The results that this president has been able to achieve have helped all people. That is the difference. The Democrats and the liberals continue to think that there are specific things that they can say or do that's going to woo black voters. The only thing that black voters and brown voters have in common is that they are black and brown. They are not politically aligned. They are not ideologically aligned. They're no monolithic. So to try to put them in a homogeneous group as one group all the time is a mistake. And all you have to do is look at the reputable polls, and you will see that the support for President Trump from black people has grown and grown and grown.

And when we get a Democratic nominee, black people are not going to leave Bloomberg or any of the other potential nominees simply because there is no litmus test on race or stop and frisk. There are no perfect white candidates who address all the African-American issues. They are all flawed.
And I agree with your guest on one thing. Beat Trump, that is not a strategy. The reason that Joe Biden is falling and falling and falling in favor with the base is because they don't have an alternative to the policies that have proven to work so well. And I happen to believe that some of the black people who don't believe these low black unemployment numbers are simply victims of brainwashing by the news and the cable outlets that they watch. So no, I don't buy it. And there are some credible polls out there. Emerson is a credible poll, and Gallup is a credible poll, and they both came up with the same results.
