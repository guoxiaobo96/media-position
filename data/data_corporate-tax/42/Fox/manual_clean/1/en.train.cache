CARLSON: So what's your plan for the Bernie ascendancy? Are you going to stay in the country?
Newsom unveiled his new health-care plan hours after a protester interrupted his swearing-in ceremony to protest the murder of police Cpl. Ronil Singh shortly after Christmas Day. The suspect in Singh's killing is an illegal immigrant with several prior arrests, and Republicans have charged that so-called sanctuary state policies, like the ones Newsom has championed, contributed to the murder by prohibiting state police from cooperating with federal immigration officials.
Upping NATO nation spending: Trump often criticized NATO countries for not paying their fair share and had suggested he would only come to the defense of nations that fulfilled their financial obligations. After some – at-times controversial – discussions between Trump and other leaders, NATO leaders pledged their unwavering commitment to boost defense spending in July 2018.

The media attacks only intensified after President Trump took office. Over the last two years, about 90 percent of the news media coverage of the president has been negative. In contrast, there were roughly twice as many positive stories about President Obama in 2009 as there were negative ones.

We can use NATO as an example in the Middle East. And that's what we should do. I think frankly it's more palatable to countries in the Middle East, if an international force comes in rather than just the United States. And from our standpoint, let somebody else pay for it. Why are we always paying? We pay for everything. One thing, I moved our troops out of Syria - on the border between Turkey and Syria. That turned out to be such a successful move, Laura.

House MAGA caucus seeks to punish Cheney for vote - Fox News: Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., is facing calls from some Republican lawmakers to step down from her leadership post as chairwoman of the House Republican Conference after she announced that she will vote to impeach President Trump. 'I don't think she should be the chair of the Republican conference anymore,' Rep. Andy Biggs, the head of the House Freedom Caucus, told Fox News host Shannon Bream. 'The reality is she's not representing the conference; she's not representing the Republican ideals.' Another GOP congressman, Montana Rep. Matt Rosendale, also released a statement calling for Cheney to step down. 'When Representative Cheney came out for impeachment today, she failed to consult with the Conference, failed to abide by the spirit of the rules of the Republican Conference, and ignored the preferences of Republican voters,' Rosendale said in a statement.

It has been one year since the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the U.S. and China continues to stonewall any credible investigation into the origins of this deadly pandemic.

Other rule changes eliminate the supermajority requirement to pass federal income tax changes, and potentially avoid future showdowns over raising the debt ceiling by suspending the debt limit through September 30 of the budget year once the House adopts a budget.

The hunt for blood is so thick that the president's decision not to attend Biden's inauguration comes as a relief.
In past decisions, the U.S. Supreme Court has cautioned the executive branch that its prosecutorial discretion, while broad, is not unfettered. It is subject to restrictions. The doctrine may not be used to adopt a sweeping policy of non-enforcement of the law. It applies only to decisions not to prosecute or expel specific individuals or small groups of people, typically for exigent reasons like war, civil unrest or political persecution.

A recent column in The New York Times entitled After Citizens United, a Vicious Cycle of Corruption, opens by stating, In the eight years since it was decided, Citizens United has unleashed a wave of campaign spending that by any reasonable standard is extraordinarily corrupt.

On jobs, fight the threat of automation by guaranteeing re-training for every worker who needs it. That means boosting your National Council for the American Worker, which helps prepare Americans for the needs of the future workforce. Under this effort, led by Ivanka Trump, over 100 companies have promised to re-skill a total of over 4.3 million workers. That's a great start but you can make much more of it. Give us that massive infrastructure program you promised. Make a pledge that by 2030, America, not China, will have the world's most modern systems for transportation, communication and energy. Rebuild America's struggling neighborhoods, too - whether urban, suburban or rural. You've already established a White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council. You've got a plan for opportunity zones. These can be the vehicles for a real transformation that helps exactly the people who backed you in 2016 On health care, you promised to take care of everyone - and then the ideological nitwits in Congress took you off course.

Procedural hurdles would likely prevent the Senate from taking immediate action on legislation that implements Trump's proposal, however. The motion to proceed to start debate on the bill would require 60 yeas.

Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate.

Biden retracted that withdrawal this week and alerted the U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that the U.S. would remain part of the organization.
Yes, we have to go faster. We are limited by numerous constraints here. The first is the supply, and we're working closely with the manufacturers so that that does not become a constraint. We also need to sort of make sure that this -- the supply gets to pharmacies, that we have enough vaccinators, that we have enough places and outreach to do the vaccinations. So, yes, I think that the supply is probably going to be the most limiting constraint early on and we're really hoping that after that first 100 days we'll have much more production, not just for these two vaccines, but we are hopeful that we'll have another one from Johnson & Johnson in the weeks ahead and perhaps even a fourth coming down the pipeline. So -- so we are really hoping that we'll have more vaccines and that will increase the pace at which we can do the vaccinations. WALLACE: I want to get to those supply concerns in a moment. But let's talk about the stakes first. We are already seeing variants of -- of the virus from the U.K., from Brazil, from South Africa that we're being told are more readily transmissible, are deadlier and more resistant to the virus. Aren't we in a race against time to -- to vaccinate everybody before we get a variant that actually blocks the vaccine, makes it impossible for the vaccine to -- to actually protect people?

The Writer's Almanac: On this day in 1968, country musician Johnny Cash recorded a live concert at Folsom Prison in California. Back in the early 1950s, while serving in the Air Force and stationed in Germany, Cash had seen a documentary on life inside the prison. This inspired him to write the song 'Folsom Prison Blues,' with its haunting lines, 'I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die.' He … began dreaming of some day playing the song live for the inmates there. … Released just four months after the concert, Live at Folsom Prison reached No. 1 on the country charts and was a huge pop crossover. Cash said: 'You build on failure. You use it as a steppingstone. Close the door on the past. You don't try to forget the mistakes, but you don't dwell on it. You don't let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space.'

McConnell may vote to convict - Axios: Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell will not consent to reconvening the Senate on Friday under emergency authorities, delaying the start of President Trump's likely impeachment trial until Jan. 19 at the earliest, McConnell's team confirmed to Axios. If the House votes to impeach Trump for incitement of the Capitol riot on Wednesday, as is expected, the trial will likely not take place until after President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20. McConnell's team informed Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer's office on Wednesday that McConnell would not consent to reconvening the Senate immediately under the 2004 emergency authorities. McConnell sent a note to Republican colleagues later Wednesday to say he has not made up his mind on impeachment: 'While the press has been full of speculation, I have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate.'

In late December, Trump became only the third president in U.S. history to be impeached. While there is little chance that the Republican-controlled Senate will vote to remove him from office, the stain of impeachment will still play heavily into Trump's legacy and will certainly be a talking point for his rivals in the 2020 election.
JASON CHAFFETZ, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I wish I could have that magic ball to tell you exactly what it is, and I hope it's sooner rather than later. But I think the Democrats have really put themselves in a tough box because the president is on the side of national security, protecting our border and doing what the federal employees, the Border Patrol, wants to do. They had 60,000 people they apprehended in November coming across the border. And when the Border Patrol goes out and says, we have to have some sort of impediment, something that will slow them down, some sort of wall or barrier, where we've done it in the past it work, that's a compelling argument.

They can argue law and argue whatever they want. After that, the president and the White House, they get 24 hours spread over two days to present their case. Then we shift questions from senators. Senators get 16 hours. Our questions have to be in writing, and the chief justice asks them for us. All of that, I would anticipate, takes about a week -- a week to a week-and-a-half. At that point, what the scheduling order provides is, the Senate is going to vote on whether or not additional witnesses are necessary. That's a 51- vote threshold. I don't know how that vote is going to come out. I think all 47 Democrats will vote yes. The open question is whether there will be four Republicans to join with those 47 Democrats. And, look, I think some of that depends on what happens in the first week- and-a-half, what arguments the House managers put forward, what arguments the White House puts forward, what questions comes out. I hope, at the end of the week-and-a-half, where Republican senators are is -- is, we have heard enough. The evidence they have put forward doesn't satisfy the constitutional standards. The Constitution says, impeachment lies for high crimes and misdemeanors.

Budget reconciliation has more consequences for the Senate than the House. Debate time is capped at 20 hours and restricts amendments. Such strictures for debate and amendments aren't rare in the House. But budget reconciliation curbs Senate filibusters. It takes 60 votes to hurdle a filibuster – often twice – on garden variety bills. Senators can block an effort to summon a piece of legislation to the floor and again to halt debate. But the elite nature of a budget reconciliation package prohibits senators from gumming up the works at either stage. It takes a mere simple majority to approve amendments and adopt the final product. In fact, senators may only make points of order (suggesting that the Senate isn't operating properly) to certain amendments or other provisions in the package and then vote to waive the Budget Act. But waiving the Budget act requires a supermajority of 60 votes.
In a written reaction, the government pledged to reform the welfare system as a result of the scandal and to quickly pay affected parents 30,000 euros ($36,300) and expand existing compensation schemes.

But caveat emptor. There is an inherent landmine which comes with reconciliation. It's called the Byrd Rule, the namesake of the legendary, late Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-WV). The practical impact of the Byrd rule is that extraneous legislative priorities can't fall under reconciliation. Some examples include whether a provision cuts or raises taxes or revenues, adds to the deficit or isn't related to budgetary matters. Senators may make a point of order to flag a non-compliant provision. As mentioned earlier, it takes 60 votes to waive the Budget Act and to overcome the Byrd Rule.

Not Andrew Jackson, not Abraham Lincoln, not Harry Truman, who were all seen as highly unorthodox presidents and were vilified by the elite opinion of their time, can hold a candle to Trump's breaking of every expectation of what a president is and how he should behave. No doubt Trump sees himself as a model of leadership; but it's not leadership according to any model we're accustomed to.

WSOC-TV: After Republican 9th Congressional District candidate Mark Harris finished addressing Mecklenburg County Republicans at the Charlotte Mecklenburg Government Center Monday night, reporters, including Eyewitness News reporter Joe Bruno, tried to ask him questions. Harris and a group of three or four other people used a fire exit to leave the Government Center as reporters attempted to ask questions. After Harris opened the door on the ground level, an alarm sounded. An unidentified man tried to block reporters from using the fire escape to follow Harris. When questioned if he worked for the city, the man allowed reporters to pursue the politician. Reporters continued to volley questions at Harris after he exited through the fire escape, but he sprinted across East 3rd Street and into the parking lot of the First Baptist Church of Charlotte, where he used to be a pastor. Harris then got into a car which sped off in the opposite direction of reporters. After the bizarre exit, in a tweet to Eyewitness News Reporter Joe Bruno, Harris said he had to get home to watch the college football National Championship game.

It's one thing to roll out reconciliation for standard-issue budgets. But it's a high parliamentary art form to use reconciliation for other controversial policy goals.

MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): House lawmakers will deliver an article of impeachment to the Senate accusing former President Trump of incitement of insurrection Monday evening. But the substance of the trial won't get started until two weeks later, February 9th, allowing time for the Senate to confirm more Biden cabinet members.
HARF: Well, in response to the first question, I think that's actually a problem the Republican Party has, that they -- that there are some member of the party, President Trump's base, that feels like there's not room in the public discourse for Republicans to criticize President Trump. And if that's the direction the party's going, they will, at some point, no longer be a true national party and they will be the party of the 30 percent Donald Trump base. So I think what will be interesting is what this Senate does as we get the Mueller report, as things get more difficult for the president.

Pence diminished - The Atlantic: According to multiple current and former administration officials, however, as Trump's friction with Congress has increased, Pence's clout has suffered. Two sources, one close to the vice president and the other close to the president, both of whom requested anonymity in order to discuss internal conversations, affirmed … that Pence was leading the Trump administration's negotiations on border security. Yet the fact remains that this weekend, the president gave his lead negotiator very little room to negotiate, sending Pence to a meeting that Trump himself said would yield nothing. This, coupled with the moments over the past month when Trump has publicly undermined Pence's messaging, has helped create a portrait of a vice president with diminishing influence.

While the court did leave open the possibility that the administration could provide an adequate argument, the deadline to begin printing census forms was quickly approaching so the Justice Department said that the administration would not continue to plead its case.

As part of the so-called Phase 1 deal, Trump scrapped his plan to impose tariffs on $160 billion in Chinese imports, and he halved his import taxes on an additional $110 billion worth. (The administration still maintains tariffs on $360 billion in Chinese products, and Beijing has imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports.) In return, China agreed to do more to protect intellectual property and to curb its practice of forcing foreign companies to hand over trade secrets as the price of admission to the Chinese market.

Shutdown stories: Florida prison guards pay the price - NYT: A federal prison here in Florida's rural Panhandle lost much of its roof and fence during Hurricane Michael in October, forcing hundreds of inmates to relocate to a facility in Yazoo City, Miss., more than 400 miles away. Since then, corrections officers have had to commute there to work, a seven-hour drive, for two-week stints. As of this week, thanks to the partial federal government shutdown, they will be doing it without pay — no paychecks and no reimbursement for gas, meals and laundry, expenses that can run hundreds of dollars per trip. 'You add a hurricane, and it's just too much,' said Mike Vinzant, a 32-year-old guard and the president of the local prison officers' union. If nature can be blamed for creating the first financial hardship, the second is the result of the even less predictable whims in Washington…

Under the left's despised Donald Trump, Gini advanced from 0.481 in 2016 to 0.489 in 2017. But then Gini fell two consecutive years, to 0.486 in 2018 and 0.484 in 2019 — 1.033 percent less unfairness.
Cuomo believes the SALT cap compounded issues that arose during the coronavirus pandemic, which has been hard on New York State.
Best of all, they gave us more than 230 constitutionalist judges confirmed by the U.S. Senate, including three Supreme Court justices. President Trump deserves every bit of credit and praise for his pro-life legacy, and it will keep bearing fruit. The standard has been set for future pro-life administrations.
The Georgia runoffs have been some of the most expensive two months of nonpresidential politics in American history. The total ad spending in the race has reached nearly $500 million.
I believe the greatest threat to America comes from within — from the political civil war we are waging against each other. The right demonizes and distrusts the left, and the left does the same to the right. Republicans and Democrats, too, often go from treating each other as adversaries to treating each other as mortal enemies.
The rise of the far left in the Democratic Party has perhaps never been more evident than since Democrats recaptured the House of Representatives in the November 2018 midterm elections. The following are just some of the most socialistic and radical plans now garnering significant support among Democrats in Congress.

Lawmakers from both major parties have called for Trump to be removed from office, either through 25th Amendment powers or a second impeachment – though it is unlikely Congress would be able to get a second impeachment and trial done before Jan. 20. CLICK HERE FOR MORE.
The CDC has traditionally been and --and -- and, you know, over the years I've talked to people in your position during various -- the swine flu, Ebola -- the head of the CDC has been the great authority, the lead agency in things like this pandemic. But you write this week, in The New York Times, and I want to put it up on the screen. You say that you will have to work very hard to restore public trust in the CDC, which, quote, has been undermined over the last year. How much damage, Doctor, did the Trump administration do to the standing of the CDC? And how do you fix that? WALENSKY: You know, I would say that the people of the CDC has been -- have been muzzled. The science has not always been followed. The great news for me and for the agency is that those exceptional public health servants, those exceptional scientists are still there.
WALLACE (on camera): You certainly don't act like a kid.
The scheme was first uncovered by the late Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian legal adviser who was hired by American-born British businessman Bill Browder to uncover details of massive financial fraud in Russia involving corrupt Russian government officials. Magnitsky was imprisoned and ultimately beaten to death while in custody. In the wake of his death, the U.S. passed a law in his name that brought sanctions against Russian oligarchs suspected of money laundering.

Perhaps the first thing that needs to be sorted out is the stalemate over border security. What started out as a Trump folly is gradually shifting somewhat. Most Americans don't favor a wall, but they do favor beefed up border security including barriers where it makes sense.

And we called them before I released the transcript, because it's a terrible thing to have to release a conversation with a leader from another country, it's a terrible thing. I mean what are other countries other than Ukraine, what are they saying. So, anyway, they have no case.
Like the presidential election, the Georgia runoffs are turnout elections, with each side running constant negative ads against the other and making efforts to energize their base.
Newsom, who won the governorship by a landslide, takes office amid a soaring state economy that has a projected $16 billion in reserves and an additional $14.8 billion unrestricted surplus. He campaigned heavily on issues relating to housing, health care and education that could raise state spending and, during his speech, Newsom promised fiscal responsibility to prepare for uncertain times ahead.

FOX News contributor Raymond Arroyo is at the White House with me for this exclusive interview today. He joins us now. Raymond, I think Trump looked like he was in fighting form today. Look, no one sleeps, he doesn't sleep, I don't sleep, nobody sleeps, but he is unbelievably resilient.
President Trump negotiated a new trade deal between the United States, Mexico and Canada to protect American workers and intellectual property while increasing American exports.

I just want to read one piece of sound here, but we don't have any sound, so I'll read it to you. Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas, if the president directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress, then that's a clear case of participating in perjury and obstruction of justice and he should resign, but if he doesn't resign, he should be impeached.
At the same time, I think there are some actions the president is taking that are going to lead to some anger and division. I think, for instance, saying we're not going to allow further leases on the government land for oil and gas, that obviously very badly hurt some of our rural communities, stopping the Keystone pipeline, that puts a lot of people out of work. Those people are going to be understandably angry.
And I talked to Senator Graham about this on the plane ride over here when we were coming over with the president in this rally.

Roman Catholic bishops are condemning President Biden's decision to reverse a policy that blocks funding for overseas abortion providers, calling a recent executive order on the issue incompatible with Catholic teaching.

Those left-wing voices presenting once-fringe ideas are also growing louder in Washington, particularly among the new intake of members in the House who have been bolder in embracing left-wing policy proposals and terms like Democratic Socialism.
One hundred years from now, a fair-minded assessment of Trump's presidency will recognize his abundant domestic and international accomplishments. Liberals unborn may be appalled. Conservatives unconceived may applaud. But both should agree that Trump was a consequential president whose sleeplessness achieved significant things, often while astonishing foes and friends alike.
WALLACE: Senator Romney, thank you. Thanks for your time this week, and it's as always good to talk to you, sir.
Then Jackson accused the show of harassing the jurors, even encouraging violence against them. That is insane. Of course, we did no such thing.

—Total employment (peaking at 158,803,000 working Americans in December 2019) never was higher. Black and Hispanic unemployment sank to their lowest levels ever, with female unemployment the lowest since President Dwight Eisenhower. Median household income in 2019 hit a record $68,703 — up 6.8% from 2018. Wages grew a healthy 3.6% that year, even as the left's favorite adult toy, income inequality, slid for the second consecutive year under Trump, after rising under President Barack Obama.

He never wants to make a phone call like the one he made earlier this week, where he spoke to Officer Singh of California's widow because an illegal immigrant came up off their border and killed him in cold blood.

Here's one guess: On Tuesday, there are two U.S. Senate elections in Georgia, and the outcome of those races will determine who controls the entire U.S. government. If the Democrats win both races -- and at this point, that is entirely possible, even likely -- the Democratic Party will run everything in Washington and they will be able to do whatever they want.
GOP West Virginia Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, a member of the Homeland Security appropriations subcommittee, dismissed Trump's comments that the shutdown could go on for years. Seven Republicans voted in favor of a Democratic bill to end the shutdown last week without funding for a border wall, and more have come out suggesting that they will back individual bills to fund certain agencies in the federal government without wall funding.

The moment Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president, the media painted a target on his back. Sanctimonious celebrities and supposedly-neutral journalists mocked and jeered his candidacy. They demeaned and insulted his supporters. They contrived savage smears and invaded his family's privacy.
GOODSTEIN: So I think, you know, you could show a lot of gaffes about Joe Biden. You could have done the same thing if you covered him decades ago. This is him.
So the president will face a stark choice. If he can make progress with the Republicans, he can pass a smaller, more targeted coronavirus bill and praise it as a bipartisan triumph. With a 50-50 Senate, even with Vice President Harris waiting in the wings, he can't lose a single Democratic vote. And he really needs 60 to avert a potential filibuster.
I suppose imitation is the highest form of flattery. And Warren agrees with Trump on the need for infrastructure spending, too:
Such fierce Trump supporters as McConnell and Lindsey Graham also broke with him in refusing to contest Biden's electoral victory. And much of the media's ire is aimed at the Republicans who backed the futile challenges, led by Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley and endorsed by 138 House Republicans.
And the big problem for him is convincing Democrats that he in any way deserves to be a part of this race, when the DNC clearly rolled out the red carpet and the velvet rope line for a guy who didn't even participate in the two first contests in this Democratic primary.

Meanwhile, Senate Republican Whip John Thune, R-S.D., told The Hill in November that that cutting spending is kind of getting back to our DNA... I would expect you'll hear a lot more about that. He also warned that he hopes the next president realizes how serious the debt crisis is and how important it is that we put measures in place to address it.
HANNITY: Hey, Lawrence, the crowd behind you, I want to ask them a question. Ask them, why did you get to go to the Trump rally and Hannity got stuck going to the dull Biden rally? Ask them who got the better assignment tonight? Ask them, I want you to ask them.
ELLEITHEE: And I do think it is premature. I think most members of House Democratic leadership agree with that. Most members of House Democratic leadership understand that the politicization of impeachment, the way Tom Steyer is doing it, the way some members are doing it, is a very dangerous path to go down. There may come a time when this is a very relevant conversation and Bob Mueller will let everyone know when that time is.

Huckabee praised former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley's comments criticizing Trump over the Capitol Hill riots by his supporters but also warning the GOP not to forget all he has done. Haley also cited Trump's accomplishments on his economic and energy policies, pushback against Iran, China, and ISIS, peace deals between Arab countries and Israel, and more.
McConnell dismissed the $2,000 checks as a universal cash giveaway and not the right approach to provide targeted relief to those who need it most.

Trump's biggest problem was and is himself. He regularly went too far, crossed too many lines, and offended too many people. If he had toned himself down a notch or three, he could have kept many of the voters who liked his tough, blunt approach without losing as many women and college graduates, especially in the suburbs, who were turned off by his tweets and his demeaning behavior.
Today, Japanese health authorities began allowing passengers to disembark from the Diamond Princess, which had been under quarantine.

Soon-to-be President Biden will find a unified Republican opposition to his party's more radical demands to eliminate private health insurance and fossil fuels and impose confiscatory tax increases.

Before the progressives, the dominant political thinkers in America were Madisonians. James Madison, who kept the notes at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787 -- notes that eventually formed much of the language of the Constitution -- made clear what the purposes of the Constitution were: to prescribe discrete areas of human endeavor in which the new federal government could legislate; to set forth open-ended areas of human behavior in which no government could legislate; and to leave the remaining areas of governmental endeavor in the hands of the states. The areas delegated to the federal government are only 17 in number and generally are referred to as federal powers. The areas in which no government may regulate are infinite and generally are referred to as natural rights.
McCarthy retreats from efforts to overturn election - WSJ: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said President Trump bore responsibility for last week's violence at the U.S. Capitol, but opposed efforts to impeach the president. 'The president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack by mob rioters,' Mr. McCarthy said in a speech on the House floor. The GOP leader said he opposes impeachment and would instead support an investigation into the riot and censuring the president. Democrats do not support a censure resolution. … Mr. McCarthy seemed to chastise members of his own conference when Wednesday he said: 'What we saw last week was not the American way. Neither is the continued rhetoric that Joe Biden is not the legitimate president.' In votes cast after the storming of the Capitol last week, Mr. McCarthy sided with a majority of House Republicans to object to Mr. Biden's wins in Arizona and Pennsylvania.

Kushner and deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino are said to have gone against other aides, such as personnel chief Johnny McEntee, to get Trump not to join other social media platforms, an outside adviser and an administration official told CNN. Trump has now been banned from most major social media platforms. His favorite social media platform, Twitter, suspended him Friday for peddling claims of election fraud.

CALIFORNIA DREAMIN' - FOR ILLEGALS: New California Gov. Gavin Newsom unveils a new health care plan that aims to give more benefits to illegal immigrants, protect ObamaCare and push his liberal state even further left ... Progressive Democrats in California won a veto-proof supermajority in the state legislature in November and control all statewide offices. Medi-Cal, the state's health insurance program, now will let illegal immigrants remain on the rolls until they are 26, according to Newsom's new agenda. The previous age cutoff was 19, as the Sacramento Bee reported.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump's plan a a non-starter before it was even revealed formally. And for his part, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, called Trump's proposal one-sided and ineffective.
CRUZ: Well, that's right. It's kind of strange how we got here. So Democrats have been having hearings, have been doing impeachment for months in the House. They brought in all sorts of witnesses. They blocked the minority from having any witnesses. And then, as soon as we get to the Senate, the Democratic talking point is, we want more witnesses. Never mind all the witnesses they called before. They want yet more. And they're trying to delay this. They're trying to drag this out. They want this trial to go on forever, because they have a political objective of attacking the president. What I have said and what I have urged the conference is, is, listen, if we go down the road of witnesses, we're not going to do what the House did. We're not going to have a one-sided kangaroo court. Instead, we're going to respect reciprocity. What does that mean? That means, if the prosecution gets a witness, the defense gets a witness. If the prosecution gets two, the defense gets two. That means, if the prosecution gets to call John Bolton, then the president gets to call Hunter Biden. And I got to tell you, the Democrats are terrified about seeing a witness like Hunter Biden testify, because they don't want to hear evidence of actual corruption, of corruption, potentially, of Joe Biden, corruption that occurred during the Obama administration. They blocked all those witnesses in the House. They're not going to succeed in blocking them in the Senate.
WALLACE: Why flatly reject the president's offer, which, yes it calls for more money for the wall, but on the other hand it does offer temporary protection for the Dreamers, temporary protection for those TPS refugees and would reopen the government?

To me, what socialism means is to guarantee a basic level of dignity. It's asserting the value of saying that the America we want and the America we are proud of is one in which all children can access a dignified education. It's one in which no person is too poor to have the medicines they need to live. It's to say that no individual's civil rights are to be violated. And it's to say that we need to really examine the historical inequities that have created much of the inequalities – both in terms of economics and social and racial justice – because they are intertwined, she said.
The Sacramento Bee reported on several of Newsom's recent hires, which seemingly signaled he's serious about his push to bring universal health care to California.

Meanwhile, in all the fanfare and patting themselves on the back, Treasury and GM made no mention of what happened to the $2.5 billion loan GM owes its union health care plan. The union loan carries a 9 percent interest rate and runs until 2017. Don't most Americans try to pay off their higher-interest debts first? Well, the union loan was not paid off. Why not? Does the union get to keep collecting 9 percent from GM until 2017, courtesy of the American taxpayer, while taxpayers give up a 7 percent return over the next five years in exchange for the hope that GM stock will be worth more than what we paid for it, someday down the road?
Despite the increase in the unemployment rate, the influx of people searching for work coupled with the job gains is an indication that the rate should decline in the coming months.

CNBC: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer will deliver the Democrats' response to President Donald Trump on Tuesday night following his Oval Office address to the nation about funding his proposed border wall. Pelosi and Schumer, who have led Democratic negotiations with the Trump administration amid a partial government shutdown that has now become the second-longest on record, will give their response from the speaker's balcony in the U.S. Capitol building after Trump's televised 9 p.m. ET address has finished. 'If his past statements are any indication,' then Trump's speech 'will be full of malice and misinformation,' the Democratic leaders said Monday night in a joint statement calling for Democrats to be given equal airtime.

This was because of a combination of the large volume of people voting absentee -- those ballots are more physically demanding to count than standard ballots -- and the close margin of the presidential race.

BILL MAHER, TV HOST: I thought it was his best week ever, and the most depressing week for me, as someone who is not a fan of Donald Trump. But the other depressing thing about this week was, you know, at his best moment, the Democrats are -- they just look like the guy that can't shoot straight or can't run straight. And if they can't get their act together, soon, it is going to be over before it begins. I mean, he won last time with nothing and now he's got money, and, you know, he's been president.
It is very likely the topic is raised, a spokesperson for Graham told Fox News.

There is a difference. A determination not to act is, by itself, a deliberate act. This is how the framers constructed our system of government. Congress considers and debates a great many bills. Not all of them pass. This is not failure in the conventional sense, but decision by declination. It constitutes a prudent and calculated process.

Since launching his nascent campaign in November, Bloomberg has spent more than $300 million on TV, radio and digital advertising, according to ad-tracking firm Advertising Analytics. During a recent interview with The New York Times, Bloomberg did not rule out the possibility of spending up to $1 billion on his bid to unseat President Trump in November. Both Bloomberg and Trump are spending an estimated $10 million apiece on dueling, 60-second Super Bowl ads.
VAN DREW: But I want her to know that we're all thinking about her. Secondly, to answer your question, look, the House had its time. They have spent months and months and months of reports, of investigations, millions upon millions of dollars. And we finally, the House, came up with two articles of impeachment, both of which are very weak. I will say this, and I will say it over and over again, because I think people must understand how important it is. Impeachment is a tool that is not meant to be used anywhere near a regular basis. Our founding fathers almost disliked it. It was said even by de Tocqueville, who was a famous Frenchman who loved America, that, when impeachment was used too often, that it was a sign of the degeneration of the country and the breakdown of the United States of America.
Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., recently announced that Democrats should increase the top personal income tax rates as high as 70 percent. That would be the highest income tax rate in the developed world, higher than all of our major trading partners and competitors.
But what about the impact of President Trump's trade policies on economic growth? In September, the Federal Reserve released a study suggesting that trade policy uncertainty could reduce U.S. economic output by more than 1 percent through early 2020. That risk strikes me as overstated, but, in any event, the uncertainties in trade policy have been meaningfully reduced since last September.
That's why so many Democrats, women, and candidates of color, were elected to Congress in 2018.

Congress already passed $600 checks as part of a broader $900 billion aid package. Those checks are currently being distributed. While Trump signed the bipartisan legislation, he also demanded bigger checks of $2,000. The House agreed by passing standalone legislation and sending it to the Senate, where it was blocked.

Liberal lawyers have scoured the country for the most anti-Trump judges, and thus far have succeeded in getting those judges to thwart President Trump's travel ban, his zero tolerance policy on illegal immigration, his revocation of President Obama's blatantly unconstitutional DACA order, and his Justice Department's refusal to give sanctuary cities money that Congress specifically withheld from them. Most recently, an activist judge even issued an injunction against something as basic as restoring a question on the U.S. census form.

LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham, and this is the Ingraham Angle tonight from Washington. And do we have a show for you tonight? My exclusive interview with President Trump at the White House. It's been a wild week all around in Washington. Of course, the rest of the world. The President passed a monumental leadership test this week with flying colors. First, we had an Iranian missile attack in retaliation for the killing of terrorist mastermind Soleimani. Democrats of course predicted World War III would ensue. And as usual, the President proved them wrong. So, now hostilities aren't a deescalated state and Iran may and I underline may even come to the negotiating table. No one thought that was going to happen. Second, the President and the GOP held firm on impeachment. And boy, did that strategy pay off. After weeks of delay, Nancy Pelosi is finally caving, and she will transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate next week. Her plot to control the Senate trial has been completely foiled. Oops. Well, I had the great privilege of sitting down with the President for a wide-ranging interview today. He made news on all of these important topics and a lot more and he shared his plans for the New Year. Here's part one of my exclusive interview with President Trump.

Today, the Democrats' only message is they won't spend one ten thousandth of the budget on a border wall. It is an appeal to the base, but is a weakening hand with a policeman killed in California and Democrats' statements that they won't compromise even $1. They have the chance to split the difference, make a deal for DACA and turn this into a win-win or let it drag on as a lose-lose. I think there will be a compromise sooner than later.

Dream big and fight hard to make our country work for everyone. That's Warren's message. It's the same message she delivered about the Great Recession in 2008, running for the Senate in 2012 and re-election in 2018. It was the same message in Iowa last week and when I saw her in New Hampshire Saturday. Throughout her speech in the New Hampshire city of Manchester, you could hear people agreeing with her as she spoke and giving her a standing ovation when she finished – 600 people who are just starting to look for a candidate to support.

Biden accepts WH offer to use Blair House night before inauguration - Fox News: The White House has offered President-elect Joe Biden use of Blair House for the night before the inauguration and he has accepted, a State Department spokesperson told Fox News. Blair House, the president's guest house, sits across from the White House on Pennsylvania Ave. Presidents-elect have for decades spent the night there on the eve of Inauguration Day. It is larger than the White House and closed to the public. The State Department oversees use of Blair House, a complex of four buildings comprising primarily used to house guests of the state. Still, the invitation to use the home typically comes from the president.
However, when it comes to legalizing recreational marijuana, Democrats sing a much different tune.

CORKE: From the Situation Room, Rose Garden, briefing and cabinet rooms, and this weekend, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, President Trump carefully crafted a forward leaning posture during the shutdown this week but for all the crime statistics and letters to Congress imploring lawmakers to fund border security including the wall, an ominous realization has a cast a pall over the nation's capital, with no sign of movement in the negotiations, a partial government shutdown is unlikely to end anytime soon.

Trump has just one week left in office, but the supporters of the impeachment push say Trump is too dangerous to stay in office a minute longer. The impeachment resolution condemns Trump for spreading lies that he won the election in a landslide and whipping up a crowd of supporters in Washington D.C. before the riot that killed five people, including a Capitol Police officer. … Unlike the last House impeachment of Trump in December 2019 … Democrats had GOP support. Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, backed impeachment because she said the violent attack at the Capitol could not have happened without Trump.

WALLACE: But she's having a little trouble with some of her members.
TRUMP: I am worried about it. Certainly, I am worried about it. Can you imagine, here we are split second timing executed like nobody has seen in many, many years on Soleimani. Can you imagine, they want us to call up and speak to crooked corrupt politician, Adam Schiff. Oh! Adam, we have somebody that we've been trying to get for a long time. We have a shot at him right now. Could we meet so that we can get your approval Adam Schiff. And he'd say well, let's do it in a couple of days. Oh! OK. Let's meet in a couple - it doesn't work that way. Number one. Number two, they leak. Anything we give will be leaked immediately. You'll see breaking news. We're about to attack in 25 minutes or do something. And by the way, I'm not somebody that wants to attack. I probably could have attacked five times, 10 times having to do with Iran. I've been very guarded because I don't want to do that. But we may have to do something. We have to be in a position where we can do it even from the negotiating standpoint. But hopefully it won't be necessary. We have tremendous sanctions. They're doing very poorly. They have riots all over their country and they could straighten out easy. But it's up to them. Whatever they want to be.

The U.S. recently achieved energy independence and became the top producer of crude oil, though it has reportedly been the largest petroleum producer since 2012 and natural gas producer since 2015.

Trump changes rules to let tax refunds flow during shutdown - WSJ: The Internal Revenue Service will pay tax refunds even though the agency is subject to the federal government shutdown, after the Trump administration reversed a longstanding policy. Monday's decision removes one of the biggest potential pains for many Americans from a prolonged shutdown. Even if the impasse over a border wall lasts into the income tax-filing season scheduled to start Jan. 28, the administration's move will let hundreds of billions of dollars flow to households. The administration is trying to make the shutdown as 'painless as possible consistent with the law,' Russell Vought, the acting director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told reporters. 'We're going to continue to take steps like that to mitigate the impact,' Vice President Mike Pence said of the tax refunds.
YouTube pulls plug on Trump - AP: YouTube has suspended U.S. President Donald Trump's channel for at least a week amid concerns over 'ongoing potential for violence,' making it the latest platform to limit the president's online activities. The Google-owned platform said it removed content that was uploaded on January 12 from the Donald J. Trump channel for inciting violence, although it was not immediately clear which videos in question were in violation. 'After careful review, and in light of concerns about the ongoing potential for violence, we removed new content uploaded to the Donald J. Trump channel and issued a strike for violating our policies for inciting violence,' a YouTube spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

JORDAN: The best -- the best evidence that there was bias is, look at the names they gave the two investigations. The Clinton investigation, the code name they gave it was the Midyear Exam. But when it came to the Trump-Russia investigation, the FBI came up with Crossfire Hurricane. You can almost like see them pounding their chest like Tarzan. We're going to go get this president. We're going to go after Donald Trump. And that's exactly what they did. And never forget what Bill Barr said. Bill Barr said there was a crisis of leadership at the upper echelon of the FBI. That's the biggest understatement ever. Of course there was. Comey was fired. McCabe was fired, lied three times under oath. Jim Baker, chief counsel, had to resign. Lisa Page had to step down and resign as well, was kicked off the Mueller team, Peter Strzok kicked off the Mueller team and fired. So, those were the five key people who ran these investigations.
DONNA BRAZILE, FORMER DNC CHAIR AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first of all, I -- I agree with Jason, I think there is so much good in this $1.9 trillion package that the -- the country is -- is really anxious for.

I mean if you look across the country today, before 8:00 in the morning, many states rollout there openings and then by 9:00 there's no way you can get a vaccine. So I think this -- this package will go a long way in healing some of the pain that we're feeling, the -- the people who are still struggling. And there are many businesses that did not get anything in the last two rounds. So this is a -- I think, a credible package.
Moving a key embassy: In May 2018, Trump fulfilled a key campaign promise by opening the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem and recognizing the city as the true capital of Israel. The international community largely does not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital as it is claimed by both Israel and the Palestinians. Previously, the U.S. kept its embassy in Tel Aviv, like other countries.

An aide? A journalist? A U.S. Capitol Police officer? A custodian? And the last few days proved you don't need airplanes, hijackers, box cutters, chemical weapons, nerve agents, or even firearms to take out the Capitol. You just need people. That's ironic. The Capitol serves as the 'the people's house.' The legislative branch is supposed to be representatives of the people and the states. You can erect all of the barricades you want around the U.S. Capitol. Build automated barricades on the streets embroidering the Capitol complex. Keep the Air Force jet fighters hot 24/7 at Joint Base Andrews across the Potomac to shoot down an intruding plane. … But, it turns out, the weapon to pierce the Capitol wasn't a gun. It wasn't a bomb. It wasn't a truck. People were the weapon.

And Joe Biden is on video at the Council of Foreign Relations bragging that he blocked a billion dollars in foreign loans and foreign aid to Ukraine until they fired the prosecutor who was potentially investigating Burisma, the company on which Hunter Biden sat on the board. When -- if the Biden family is profiting to the tunes of millions of dollars, the president is entirely justified to say, let's investigate and find out what happened. That's why Hunter Biden is such an important witness and why the Democrats don't want to focus on, what was the evidence of actual corruption?

But on a serious note, this sticks in my craw. We heard Joe Biden say, you're not getting $1 billion until you fire the Ukrainian prosecutor who's investigating his son, who is being paid millions, who's on tape saying that he had no experience in oil, gas, energy or Ukraine.

Even within the Democratic Party, this is a bridge too far. According to a post-election November Gallup poll, 54 percent of Democrats and Democratic-learning independents want the party to move more to the center. Only 41 percent of the same group want the Democratic Party to move further left.
He wants to fund trillions in spending and this green new deal madness, eliminate oil and gas, take over not only the energy sector of our economy, but also all of health care with this insane Medicare for All program, with and estimated $52 trillion price tag over ten years.
It has really been a tale of two economies lately. Consumer related things have been strong. But anything relating to business investment or manufacturing or trade has been quite tough, economist Austan Goolsbee, who advised President Obama's campaign and chaired Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, told FOX Business. Manufacturing has literally been in recession. Part of that has come from the damage from the tariffs. Another part has been that the tax cuts did not seem to generate anything close to the kind of sustained improvement that was promised.
Yet today, we are witnessing a government that is beyond ideologically progressive. Does Obama understand that progressive ideas have consequences and that governmental behavior often has unintended consequences? It would appear not, as his long train of incompetence and indifference, grounded in progressive thought, keeps picking up speed. It is crushing human freedom, destroying human wealth and even taking human lives.
SCOTT: Yes, let's get to the bottom of it. But, look, the bottom line is, we're going to do this.
The truth is that the banning of posts by President Trump is just the latest example of the steady efforts by social media companies and others on the left to silence conservative voices. The cancel culture has now created a new and unnerving phase of a societal purge for supposed wrongthink.

And then government will step in, spending billions of our tax dollars on a government-owned and controlled Internet.

With members of Congress on both sides of the aisle rattled in the aftermath of a siege of the Capitol Building, lawmakers are looking at ways to respond to President Trump's actions leading up to the riot.
But the president uses this contrived failure as a pretext to arrogate the authority of another branch of government. He wields his pen to legislate by executive decree. He well knows he is exceeding his power. In 2011, he said, I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the (immigration) on my own. But that's not how our system works. That's not how our democracy functions. That's not how our Constitution is written. He was right. It was a rare moment of clarity for a man who fancies himself a constitutional scholar.
From revving up the economy through tax cuts; increasing military spending; conducting tariff and trade wars with Beijing that roil global markets; and trimming commitments in places like Europe and the Middle East that irritate and outrage critics; Trump has taken an all-out we win, they lose approach to dealing with the China challenge, very similar to the approach our fortieth president used to win the Cold War.

David Vitter of Louisiana has introduced an amendment (SA 2440) to the Department of the Interior appropriations bill that prohibits any federal funding for Browner's policy directives.

As a top surrogate for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign, Warren often unloaded on then-candidate Trump, at one time calling him a thin-skinned, racist bully. In her Senate re-election campaign last year, Warren repeatedly tied her Republican challenger to the president. And she's long been a very vocal Trump critic in the Senate.
The only path that remains to nominate a Republican rather than Mr. Trump is to have an open convention, he added.
Polemics alone are inadequate. Parties must have something positive to say along with the criticism of the other party's positions. Voters know that we have no real discussion on Trump's policies, just hyperbole, hysteria, and obstruction.

But then there's the actual -- the policy issue, which is the impeachment issue. And Nancy Pelosi's challenge is to do something that she didn't do very well the last time she was speaker, which is to try to move legislation that divides Republicans, that peels off Republicans. And the one thing that will keep Republicans unified, at least for now, prior to the Mueller report, is all this impeachment stuff. If it just becomes -- if the Democratic Party is the antimatter universe version of what you were talking but with the Republican Party, which I think is a real concern, of just the anti-Trump party, than that will unify the Republicans.

CRUZ: Well, look, there's no doubt Joe Biden served with an awful lot of senators. There are a number of senators who consider him a personal friend. I am hopeful and I believe that senators will do their constitutional duty, which means that they're not going to decide this case based on friendship, but, rather -- there was a reason that the framers of the Constitution gave the responsibility of conducting an impeachment trial to the Senate. They debated quite a bit where to do the impeachment, particularly of a president.
Meanwhile, all these remaining cruise passengers are now off the ship and, well, shipping out to their home countries. They have been cleared of the coronavirus, but my next guest and her husband, so far, they're not that lucky. And they're not that happy.

Yet, the pathologies of modern rural America are familiar to anyone who visited downtown Baltimore in the 1980s: Stunning out of wedlock birthrates. High male unemployment. A terrifying drug epidemic. Two different worlds. Similar outcomes. How did this happen? You'd think our ruling class would be interested in knowing the answer. But mostly they're not. They don't have to be interested. It's easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born Americans who are slipping behind.

And -- and -- so, again, I -- not -- not to mention that back when we did it in 2013 we weren't in the midst of a pandemic, which I think should be the number one focus outside of national security. And I actually think it's related to national security.

Given Ocasio-Cortez's direct connections to former members of McKibben's 350.org and the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, as well as the close similarities between the language of the Green New Deal and the policies proposed by key environmentalists involved with the Leap Manifesto, it seems very likely much of the Green New Deal is nothing more than a recycled version of a failed, three-year-old socialist proposal from Canada.

Newly-elected Utah senator Mitt Romney kicked off 2019 with an op-ed in the Washington Post that savaged Donald Trump's character and leadership. Romney's attack and Trump's response Wednesday morning on Twitter are the latest salvos in a longstanding personal feud between the two men. It's even possible that Romney is planning to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. We'll see.
GOODSTEIN: I think people will throw a fit if he gets a plurality, but doesn't get the nomination. And I'd say go. Go whoever you're going to go with. We need somebody who is going to be a good Democrat, not what you are.

This is not the first lawsuit brought against California officials over dining bans amid the coronavirus pandemic. The owner of one restaurant in Sherman Oaks also filed a suit last month over the outdoor dining ban, alleging it was a gross abuse of their power. And a judge previously ruled in favor of a group of Los Angeles restaurants who challenged a county outdoor dining ban in November, though an appeal is pending. But this appears to be largest case raised so far against state officials over the ban.

At the foundation of all of Ocasio-Cortez's reforms is her commitment to socialism, an economic system that in its most utopian form aims to eliminate nearly all private property and puts the collective—which, in a democratic society, is simply the majority of voters—in charge of every aspect of life, including the education of your children, the extent of your rights to practice your religion, and your most important health care decisions.
Romney voiced his support for Trump's Republican rival, Sen. Ted Cruz, in March 2016. In the Utah nominating caucus, Romney said he'd vote for Cruz, despite Trump being the clear front-runner of his party.
So there's someone who's going to do this intentionally, and they're not going to be punished at all, all because Democrats want to protect her a larger group. It's absolutely ludicrous.

The populist bedrock of that platform was to make government deliver for working Americans, not the big donors and the big corporations. The focus was the middle class and working families -- and now that's Elizabeth Warren's focus, too.
JORDAN: Yes. They were out to get the president. You had on Don Trump Jr. I thought it was a great interview. He said in impeachment started on Election Day. I actually think it started even sooner. I think it started on July 31, 2016, when they opened the Trump-Russia investigation, as I said, went and spied on four American citizens associated with the Trump campaign. And who was heading that investigation? Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, Peter Strzok, who said in one of those text messages, just went to a Southern Virginia Walmart. I can smell the Trump support. The disdain they have for the president and, just as importantly, the disdain they have for folks like you and me, Maria, who support the president, who voted for the president, that is what is so wrong. And then they get caught with these text messages. And now they're going to sue? This is ridiculous. The American people -- it's great that we -- those text messages were released, because the American can people can see the bias, the animus that these folks, who ran the two biggest investigations probably of our lifetime, the Clinton e-mail investigation and the Trump-Russia investigation, they can see the bias and the animus they had against President Donald Trump.
I have plenty of grievances against President Trump's opponents. I was collateral damage in the Russia hoax, hounded by the president's enemies and the liberal media.

What you say is certainly true Chris. One other contributing factor to this is the Internet (the 'unending reservoir of dumpster juice'), specifically the willingness of people to believe all manner of nonsense if it is written in black and white and presented on a computer screen.

Laura, look, I always say his ability to greet opposition with a laugh and kind of diffuse people with that humor, that is a great quality to have in an office like this, particularly as you go into a campaign. He also went out of his way to take pictures with the entire team that was with us today. Unbelievable, really went out of his way. You made a lot of news in that interview lady. We learned that four embassies were targeted by Soleimani. For the first time he said the Iraqi government privately wants the U.S. to stay in their country. And he sounded off on Pelosi and the whole impeachment imbroglio. And for the first time, the president said he would invoke executive privilege to keep Bolton from testifying. Oh, and you and the president apparently our great sparring partner when it comes to Chinese and foreign workers coming into the country.
One of President Trump's biggest flaws is not knowing when to stop, as his speech before the Capitol invasion demonstrated. But while he thankfully saved his worst mistake for last, Democrats are exhibiting the same flaw at the very start of their term.

No, that's not what happened. What happened was the people in charge rigged the game. Joe Biden got his party's nomination for one reason: Because Bernie Sanders turned out to be more popular than anyone expected him to be. Sanders was an actual threat to the Democratic establishment. He talked about changing tax rates, so they crushed him. Out of nowhere, CNN told us that Sanders was violent, sexist, a danger to women everywhere, even a Russian asset.

President Obama, most congressional Democrats and many congressional Republicans are ardent progressives. They view Congress as a general legislature with no limits to its powers -- and they mean no limits. For example, in an area clearly beyond congressional reach, such as in-state highway speed limits, the progressives found a way to extend their reach. They offered money to the states to repave their highways, with the condition that the states adhere to federally prescribed speed limits (only South Dakota declined). Once the courts gave their imprimatur to this assault on the Constitution, the feds realized that by spending taxpayer dollars -- by bribing the states -- they could extend their regulatory tentacles to any extra-constitutional area they chose.

Men like Madison, Jefferson and Adams were keenly aware of the tyranny and corruption of authority concentrated in too few hands. They knew the thirst for power posed an existential danger to those who cherish freedom. Their genius was in crafting a sustaining document that would end the arrogance of one man rule and protect the inherent rights of all men. They knew that absolute power corrupts.

The assumption is that once those four footnotes which are declassified now are declassified, it will reveal that the investigation actually began further back, and that those sources mentioned in Horowitz's report particularly Stefan Halperin and others that were connected with the FBI, we'll see a trail of that leading prior to July 31st. And it will kind of turn the whole Horowitz report on its head, stating that the Crossfire Hurricane was a reason for opening the investigation. So, that was one.

In this, a lot of young voters, a lot of progressive voters, they'd be attracted to the message of Sanders, or Warren, and like I mentioned on the western half of Vermont, they split the vote, 30 percent to 32.3 percent. Could that happen here in New Hampshire? It could, Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders from Vermont.
California has positioned itself as the center of the Trump resistance, Jessica Levinson, a clinical law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, told Fox News. It's bloody combat.
If we stay home as much as possible, and wear masks when we have to go to the doctor, shop for groceries or go for a hike, California can come out of this in a way that saves lives and puts us on a path toward economic recovery, Newsom previously said.
Political winds rarely get more favorable for a party than they are now, with Dems winning control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. Joe Biden will get the Cabinet and judges he wants and the path is open to tax and regulatory overhauls. Media handmaidens will cheer his every move.

But history is written by the winners, and the mainstream media, by and large, are declaring that their years of warning that Trump was a dangerous character who could wreak havoc on society have now been vindicated. The press, which Trump attacked as recently as Wednesday morning as the enemy of the people, are now casting him as the real enemy, emboldened by those aides and supporters who are now trashing him both on the record and in blind quotes to reporters (a total monster, one administration official told the Washington Post).
The law eventually factored into the controversy over the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting. President Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., his son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort agreed to take a meeting with Veselnitskaya, her translator, a Russian lobbyist and music producer Rob Goldstone.
The problem with journalists and media, especially today's media, is that they magnify the sensational at the expense of the significant. The historian's job is to do the opposite. Trump's first two years have certainly been sensational. That's made it hard for journalists and pundits to see what's happening underneath.

The majority of American Millennials identify as socialist, according to surveys by both Reason-Rupe and the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. That's the bad news. The good news is that just 32 percent of Millennials can define socialism.

The expected continuation of steady job growth suggests that such risks might be — for the moment, anyway — overblown. However, the stock market will have to weigh whether the strong job growth encourages the Fed to hike rates in 2019 more frequently than investors had previously anticipated.
Sanders has signaled a willingness to pass legislation without GOP support by using this special process that's reserved for tax and fiscal matters. The first test could be Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief legislation that is the first priority for the new Democratic administration.
The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer earned $3.99 billion, or $1.40 a share, as total revenue rose 8.6 percent to $134.6 billion in its first fiscal quarter.

The surging U.S. economy has been one of Trump's main talking points when stumping for his reelection – touting low unemployment figures across the board, job creation and promising economic growth numbers.

Well, now the president says it is true -- he can alter the laws unilaterally. Why the metamorphosis? What changed? The law and the Constitution are still the same. Which leaves Obama. When it comes to the truth, inconvenient or otherwise, he is a chameleon like no other politician. He never hesitates to contradict himself, conjuring a new breadth of hypocrisy.
TRUMP: I don't think it helps him, because, again, he doesn't have what it takes to be a politician.
Several Republicans pushed the Interior Department to find money to restaff national parks amid growing concerns over upkeep and public safety.

The timing of this maneuver also is troubling. The administration's so-called Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee, a TARP excise tax intended to recover TARP losses, was the subject of the Finance Committee hearing. The Office of Management and Budget, and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, estimate that overall taxpayer TARP losses will exceed $100 billion, and the auto companies will account for over 30 percent of that amount, more than $30 billion. So why does the president exclude the auto companies from his TARP excise tax proposal? I raised this issue at the hearing. I noted that GM refused to testify. The next day we learned that GM, with the permission of Treasury, withdrew billions from the TARP escrow fund and accelerated the repayment of the entire GM TARP loan. Immediately, GM and the administration launched a public relations campaign touting repayment.

—The president pushed school choice, expanded educational savings accounts to cover K-12 students, reauthorized the DC Voucher Program with $85 million in funds, stabilized assistance to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, conditioned federal assistance to colleges on their defense of campus free speech, and (by shredding Obama's Title IX guidance letter) restored due process for college students (mainly men) often falsely accused of sexual misconduct.

And I think we'll look back, I think in history when science is more fully appreciated on life inside the womb, that we'll look back in future generations kind of like we look at the era of slavery and say, How did people tolerate that?

If you need even more evidence the Democratic Party has become so disconnected from everyday Americans that even its base is jumping ship, look no further than revelations made by former Vice President Joe Biden's brother last week.
The seed of Millennial miseducation, which grew into the Tree of the Lack of Knowledge as activist educators substituted ideology for scholarship, is finally bearing its rotten fruit. According to one survey, one third of Millennials believe President George W. Bush killed more people than Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. Over 40 percent of Millennials have never heard of Mao Zedong; another 40 percent and 30 percent, respectively, are unfamiliar with Vladimir Lenin and Che Guevara. Two-thirds of Millennials cannot identify Auschwitz, and 22 percent have never heard of the Holocaust, twice the percentage of American adults on average.
Something like this has been in happening in our country for three years. Donald Trump rode a surge of popular discontent all the way to the White House. Does he understand the political revolution that he harnessed? Can he reverse the economic and cultural trends that are destroying America? Those are open questions.

Vice President Mike Pence arrived at the White House complex Sunday afternoon for a second round of negotiations with top congressional aides. Trump, who had tweeted the previous day that there had been little headway, said he was not expecting much.

If either of the two Republican incumbents — Sens. David Perdue or Kelly Loeffler — winds up winning, the GOP will hold a narrow 51-49 majority over Democrats in the Senate. If both win, Republicans will hold a 52-48 majority. This would enable a united Republican Party to block legislation backed by Biden and his fellow Democrats, forcing the incoming president to compromise on key initiatives.

If you think I'm exaggerating, I'm not. Because when you say the wrong thing in Ocasio-Cortez world, they put you in detention hall and you never get out. Remember, they believe that they are right and you're evil. And moderates even seem petrified of taking on these new progressives. And Republicans ought to take the progressive takeover of the Democratic Party very seriously and offer a strong counter narrative.
Pelosi, D-Calif., said after the meeting that the president was petulant. Schumer said Trump slammed his hand on a table in frustration, but Vice President Mike Pence and other Republicans, speaking to reporters afterward, denied that happened.
Ocasio-Cortez garnered support from progressives, including Cynthia Nixon
Progressives hate the states because they can be laboratories of less government. They love central government and all of its creations, such as the cash-printing Federal Reserve, the wealth-stealing progressive income tax, and the concept of a federal safety net for all persons. None of this, except the income tax (which Wilson promised would not exceed 3 percent of adjusted gross income), is authorized by the Constitution.

It was a huge, productive, extraordinarily important 24 hours for President Trump and the deranged hate-Trump left. They are spinning out of control, beyond even my predictions.

Barr acted similarly when he launched the probe of the Justice Department's handling of the investigation and prosecution of Michael Flynn, who briefly served as President Trump's national security adviser.

Yet President Obama has decided to usurp this power by unilateral directive, unconstrained by established checks and balances.

THE LEAD STORY – THE WALL BETWEEN TRUMP AND PELOSI: Newly empowered House Democrats late Thursday passed a bill to reopen the government without funding President Trump's border wall ... In a news conference Thursday night, newly-elected House Speaker Nancy Pelosi broadly discussed the ongoing partial government shutdown, which has dragged on since Dec. 22. Even as she said she would be willing to fund border security, Pelosi called a border wall a symptom of an old way of thinking and promised not to fund it. We're not doing a wall. Does anyone have any doubt that we're not doing a wall? Pelosi told reporters.

President Obama claims he is entitled to overhaul immigration laws in the name of prosecutorial discretion. It is one of those wonderfully fungible phrases in the law. Elastic because it is vague and ambiguous. Useful because it can be easily abused. Mr. Obama has appropriated this doctrine to argue he has near boundless discretion to amend, revise, waive or suspend the execution of immigration laws. As chief executive, he is empowering himself to decide what laws may be enforced or ignored and what persons may come or go across our southern border irrespective of what the law actually states.

And the reason why it did and ultimately got him elected and he got 75 million votes is because you have tens of millions of Americans that feel this economy isn't working for people like them, that feel socially displaced, even like strangers in their own country, and who believe that both of the parties, at least traditionally, and all of politics doesn't understand or care about any of this, that they don't matter to people.

I think what's going on here is that Cuomo, like so many on the left, is really worried. He's worried that the Supreme Court might reverse Roe, might send it all back to the states.

SCHWEDHELM: Ebola was highly infectious, but not as contagious. And this virus that we're talking about the COVID-19 is more like influenza in how it spread through respiratory droplets.
Yesterday, Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York state, said that state has already run out of its initial run of doses. Are we going to get into a situation by let's say the end of March, where the initial run, 200 million doses from Pfizer and Moderna are -- are gone, you don't have enough from Johnson and Johnson or other people, and we're really in a supply crunch by the end of March? WALENSKY: You know, from the data that I've seen so far, my understanding is that the current supply crunch is the one that is -- I'm most worried about. We have every indication that over time we'll get more and more vaccine. So we certainly can't predict any of the -- the obstacles that would come in our way here. But from the data that I've seen so far, I'm hopeful that we'll actually get an increasing amount of supply, not a stagnating one. WALLACE: And -- and is there a specific point in this whole run that you're particularly worried about in -- in the next two or three months that you think the first doses will have run out and we won't have geared up for a second run? WALENSKY: You know, we are carefully monitoring the second doses that are going to be required in the time ahead so that people who have gotten their first dose will have access to their second dose.
Right now, within the Republican Party, I think that decline in his job
And then when you add on to that all the obligations and commitments the Obama administration made the Paris climate accord, you're talking about jobs in the oil patch, in the coal mines, in fracking and building pipelines and transporting that and processing it into electricity -- tens of thousands of jobs that Joe Biden eliminated with the stroke of a pen, merely because it's fashionable in his party to oppose any energy source that comes from fossil fuels.
So I'm -- I'm really hopeful that that is not going to be the case. But what you're commenting on is absolutely true, that we don't have as many doses as we would like now for states like New York, for other states that are see -- claiming to have run out of vaccine. And so right now is actually the pressure point that I'm feeling and by the end of March or so I really do hope that our production has scaled up dramatically and that we actually have way more supply than we do right now. WALLACE: Then there is distribution. The new White House COVID coordinator says what you inherited from the -- the Trump administration is much worse than any of you could have imagined. What is the distribution problem and how do you fix it? WALENSKY: You know, I would say one of the biggest problems right now is, I can't tell you how much vaccine we have. And if I can't tell it to you, then I can't tell it to the governors and I can't tell it to the state health officials. If they don't know how much vaccine they're getting, not just this week but next week and the week after, they can't plan. They can't figure out how many sites to roll out, they can't figure out how many vaccinators that they need and they can't figure out how many appointments to make for the public.

The Democrat campaign finance plan dusts off their decades-old dream for the public financing of political campaigns. This excessive spending could go a long way toward paying for a border wall and enhanced border security. Curiously, this bill appears not to directly address the large amounts of money being raised and spent by Super PACs that liberals complain about ad nauseam. Maybe that's because Democrats employ Super PACs to get their message out just as much as Republicans. According to a recent column in the Los Angeles Times, Among the top 25 super PACs in 2018 spending, through Dec. 3, contributions supporting Republicans and conservatives came to $341 million; contributions on the Democratic and liberal side totaled about $282 million.
In a December surprise, General James Mattis quit over the Syrian troop withdrawal. Not since President Harry Truman fired the revered General Douglas MacArthur has a president had to contend with a general opposing civilian rule in such a bold manner. But the decision to draw down 2,000 troops was hardly a momentous military decision in the leagues of sending hundreds of thousands of troops to Korea, the decision to start the Iraq war or to use the atomic bomb against Japan. It was more likely a pretext to leave the administration and surely there will be a multimillion-dollar book contract next. Military command moves on, and this is just another failed power play.
I promise you, if you interview Border Patrol agents, they will tell you that walls work, Brandon Judd, the president of the Border Patrol union, told the media after Trump's introductory remarks.

We built those walls, those physical barriers, and illegal immigration dropped exponentially. Anywhere that you look, where we have built walls, they have worked ... We need those physical barriers and we appreciate President Trump and all of his efforts in getting us those physical barriers.

The report also criticized the government for the way it provided information to parliament about the scandal.
What Biden has done is he is ignoring that federal law, disregarding that federal law by ordering to the attorney general to ignore that, ordering Department of Homeland Security not to follow those orders. That is in direct contradiction of federal law, and, Sean, is in direct contradiction of an agreement between the state of Texas and the United States Department of Homeland Security.

He found that, based on manipulated search outcomes, biased search outcomes, that Google in 2016 shifted 2.6 million votes towards Hillary Clinton. Now, here's the interesting thing, Maria. Dr. Epstein is not a Republican. He is a liberal Democrat. He voted for Hillary Clinton. So, politically, he was happy to see more votes for Hillary. But he was horrified to see big tech have that kind of power. And he went on to testify what you just played, which is, if they do the same thing in 2020, which all indications are that they're going to, they could shift up to 15 million votes.

Abuse of power alone -- and history has shown this -- similar to also obstruction of Congress, those types of articles of impeachment have been tried on for size before, but they have not fared well. The core of the impeachment parameters allege that crimes have been committed, treason, bribery, and things like that, in other words, other high crimes and misdemeanors.

How does Ocasio-Cortez plan to pay for these massive programs? In a 60 Minutes interview with Anderson Cooper that will air on Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez suggested that some of her plans could be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy to rates as high as 70 percent. But even that huge tax increase wouldn't be nearly enough to pay for her numerous policy proposals, which is why Ocasio-Cortez has suggested the United States create a system of new publicly-owned banks that the government could use to run up the national debt. She has also called for printing money to pay for her socialist reforms.

And certainly not when it comes to trade in automobiles and auto parts.

I'm not fond of the Section 301 tariffs on products from China, but I agree with the reasons they've been applied.

O'Rourke plans solo road trip before making 2020 decision - WSJ: Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke is asking aides to create an itinerary for him to take a solo road trip outside of Texas where he would 'pop into places' such as community college campuses, as he considers whether to enter the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, according to a person familiar with the plans. Mr. O'Rourke's trip would begin from his El Paso home and keep him away from Iowa and other early-voting states. Mr. O'Rourke doesn't plan to be accompanied by staff or press, though he may document the trip on social media and allow people he meets to do so as well. He doesn't plan to make a final decision on a presidential bid until at least February. … Decisions to be made in coming weeks by former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, along with Mr. O'Rourke's move, will help shape the contours of the 2020 Democratic campaign.

NY Post: Hundreds of National Guard troops have been forced to sleep in the hallways of the Capitol — believed to be the first time troops have camped there since the Civil War. Images from Wednesday morning show the battle-ready guards sleeping in almost any spot they can find — many with their assault rifles propped up nearby. The troops had slept there overnight after getting the call at 6 p.m. Tuesday — with at least 20,000 National Guardsmen now expected in Washington, DC, amid an alarming surge in threats of violent revolts against next Wednesday's inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. They were still sprawled on floors — some using stairs for makeshift pillows — when the House convened just after 9 a.m. In surreal images, lawmakers were forced to step over the slumped bodies of their guardians as they arrived for the hearings on impeaching President Trump for the very riots that sparked the troops' presence.

Within days, Bernie Sanders melted away and Joe Biden got the job. No one expected that, least of all Biden. Once he was chosen, virtually every power center on earth joined the cause.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is one of the rising stars of the new Democrat-led Congress and the left's latest media darling. Millions were captivated by her surprising 2018 primary victory over long-time liberal House member Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., and her achievement of becoming, at age 29, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.

It's underrated and often forgotten just how sick Americans are of the inaction in Washington. Congress enjoys an approval rating in the low teens on a good day and voters overwhelmingly believe representatives are more concerned with themselves and playing politics than what's best for Americans.
But this is not unexpected for people who take the Obamas at their word. Listen to what Michelle Obama has said in the past:
I think it's a nonstarter for him to ask for a permanent wall and for us to have a temporary fix. Just think about what happened to DACA children. If you're finishing high school and get a temporary three year fix, it means by the time you got to your junior year of college, you are under threat of having this rug (ph) pulled out from under you, never being able to finish school, just as the president did when he came into office and got rid of what President Obama had done for DACA recipients.

The president spoke to FOX News in Texas, on the banks of the Rio Grande, where he visited the border region to argue that a barrier would deter drug and human trafficking into the United States. Back in Washington, Democrats in the Senate on Thursday failed to proceed with House-passed spending bills that would fund the government and end the partial shutdown without new border-wall money.

In the end history will judge Donald Trump not on his tweets but his deeds. And these, by and large, have reflected his undeniable virtues.
Democrats would lose out because the citizenship question would affect predominantly liberal districts, but that's not a legally sufficient objection, legal analysts say.
Trump said during his campaign he would make life better for working families, but his actions have instead made life much better for the one percent thanks to massive tax cuts that have exploded the deficit and reduced the revenues for the federal government. Fewer regulations for corporations and more tariffs have made life much tougher for working families who work more, make less, and pay more for food, goods, appliances, and automobiles (thanks to the Trump tariffs).
But two points here, Sean, one, I would still caution Republicans, despite being the president being on a roll, having a very good ten days, this is going to be a close election. We should not overestimate the Democratic implosion.
President-elect Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden, who has been under federal investigation, appeared at the Capitol on Wednesday for his father's inauguration ceremony.
We are approaching ... record low unemployment rates and once one gets so close to zero, it cannot continue to fall at the rates that it [used to], Ed Stringham, President of the American Institute for Economic Research, told FOX Business.
All of that money that's going to Hillary and Jeb and Scott and Marco and all of them - the people that are putting up that money – it's like puppets, Trump said back then.
The president's appeal is and was that he is an anti-Washington outsider. A massive number of Americans don't trust politicians and hold Washington in low regard. Many yearn for someone authentic, who bluntly speaks his or her mind.
Ocasio-Cortez, sworn in as Congress' youngest member on Thursday, is one of a number of Democrats who backs the Green New Deal -- which aims to combat both climate change and income inequality with a massive and costly economic overhaul.

You asked about the International Olympics Committee saying we don't want any political displays during these medal ceremonies.

Don't divide people with your political messages. I would like to see in the United States, not only in the Olympics.

Proponents of Open Internet regulation believe the phone and cable companies are evil corporations who will rip-off customers and interfere with innovation and free speech. But they've been warning of impending doom now for over seven years, and just the opposite has happened—companies have done everything possible to compete with each other on price and quality, especially in the hyper-competitive wireless market.
But Republicans now represent rural voters. They ought to be interested. Here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. Manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation. All that remained in many places were the schools and the hospitals, both traditional employers of women. In many places, women suddenly made more than men.
President Trump on Thursday condemned what he described as a heinous attack on the Capitol the preceding day and called for healing.

TRUMP: By the way, you know how bad the Iran deal was? The Iran deal, I did a great thing getting out of the Iran deal. They gave 150 billion, they gave 1.8 and forget that. You couldn't do inspections of the most important locations. And you know another big thing, they have the right to do ballistic missiles. We couldn't go into areas and look; we'd have to give massive notice. So, if they were doing something that they could clean them up, it was ridiculous. But most importantly, it expires. This is a short-term agreement. And now once it expired, they have an absolute clear, unstopped path of nuclear weapons. Unstopped. In a very short period of time, the deal that President Obama made with John Kerry, who may be the worst negotiator I've ever seen that deal expires and you know what? Once it expires, you can't do what I did. I mean because they have a deal that says once it expires, they can do what they want to do. You cannot let Iran have a nuclear weapon. That's what I'm doing.
Now, do you believe, as I do, that this is a slam-dunk case, premeditated fraud on a FISA court using a dirty Clinton bought and paid for, phony unverifiable, now debunked Russian dossier? Do you believe we get the indictments in this?

Those on the left calling for higher taxes have frequently pointed to tax rates in place before President Ronald Reagan took office, to argue they are not unprecedented. But free-market conservatives have argued there were more loopholes in the '60s and '70s, meaning most high earners didn't actually pay those ultra-high rates.

Five decades and some $16 trillion in federal outlays later, Manhattan Institute scholar Brian Riedl calculates, Trumponomics chopped the poverty rate from 11.8 percent in 2018 to 10.5 percent in 2019 — its nadir since federal estimates began in 1959, five years before the War on Poverty.
Obama left behind a wiped-out, unpopular Democratic Party. Trump leaves an exhausted and split Republican Party that almost took the House in November, has a 50-50 tie in the Senate and still has control of most governorships and statehouses. The GOP in 2021 is in a much better position than it was in 2009.

In a dramatic primetime moment, the liberal constitutional law scholar reiterated that although he voted for Hillary Clinton, he could not find constitutional justification for the impeachment of a president for non-criminal conduct, or conduct that was not at least akin to defined criminal conduct.
The FCC has also set up its own blog at www.OpenInternet.gov for commenting on its proposed regulations, where the left is running wild at the moment. It's not clear what legal status blog posts will have, so it's important to put an official comment in the docket, but we also shouldn't let the radical left run wild on www.OpenInternet.gov and create the perception that most American think the Internet needs to be regulated. So it's worth a trip over there to weigh in on the side of regulatory restraint, free markets, and private ownership.
In a televised White House address on Saturday afternoon, Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, in exchange for the $5.7 billion he has been seeking for a barrier along the nation's southern border with Mexico.

Responding to the snub by the committee, Ocasio-Cortez spokesman Corbin Trent said that she hoped to be on it, but we're excited to see what committees she does get.
President Trump reauthorized the Washington, D.C. School Voucher Program (which Obama-Biden repeatedly tried to kill), boosted it with $85 million, and established steady funds for Historically Black Colleges and Universities.
The rules package also establishes a climate-change committee. The Select Committee on the Climate Crisis lacks some of the same legislative teeth that its predecessor committee wielded when Democrats last controlled the House. But, the House rules give the panel until March 31, 2020 to make recommendations to other committees for actual policy changes and legislation.
Biden's COVID-19 proposal also includes a provision to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, vaccine funding, money for schools and state and local governments -- priorities that may not fit into budget reconciliation rules. Democrats may be required to pick up GOP votes or compromise for a smaller package that has bipartisan support.

WaPo: As a game warden for Oklahoma's Department of Wildlife Conservation, Cannon Harrison is used to working on investigations… His latest bust, however, came easily — courtesy of the dating app Bumble. The 24-year-old received a notification in December telling him that he had matched with a woman in his area. … Harrison asked how she was doing. She had just shot a 'bigo buck,' she told him — a big old buck. 'Pretty happy about it,' she wrote. At first, Harrison figured it had to be a prank. His profile on the dating app doesn't mention what he does for a living. But in rural McIntosh County … plenty of people recognize him as the game warden. … The next morning, game wardens showed up at her home. … But the odds that a poacher and a game warden would end up matching on a dating app, he said, were 'probably less than winning the lottery.'
He's sending a message that it's OK for Democrats to embrace Trump and Republicans, as opposed to feeling obligated to stay in the Democratic Party, Grossman said.

The ridiculousness of these actions is only matched by the extreme policies the out-of-touch House Democrats are trying to sell us.
TRUMP: If we're hearing from all of those witnesses, then I want to sort of hear it, because I realize, again, having watched this thing transpire over the last few years and the nonsense perpetuate itself, I definitely want to hear from the other side. If the Republicans -- and some of them, the, let's call it weaker Republicans -- I sort of like the Rand Paul model -- make them vote on it. If some of those guys don't want to hear from the witnesses that we'd want to hear from, but we will hear from the others, I want to know about it, because they don't deserve to be in office. So it really depends. We have to play the game the way the Democrats have played the game. We have to play hard, but fair. Hearing from everyone is totally fair. That's not what we have seen so far, while the Democrats have controlled the process. It's not been fair in any way, shape or form.

SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, on Wall Street, people are a little bit surprised, because, as Joe Biden pointed out, Bloomberg has been a Republican most of his life, meaning that he's a proponent of capitalism, lower taxes, less regulation, the trickle-down wealth effect, and now he's talking about a transaction tax on Wall Street, expanding the Volker rule, meaning more oversight for the banks.
He defended President Trump's work trying to help the U.S. economy recover from more than eight years of slow or no growth, adding that in the three years of the Trump recovery, the country has seen significant economic stability, job growth and a decrease in unemployment numbers.

This Commission pursues a clearly socialist agenda of centralized control under a regime of global governance that would enforce extreme environmental political correctness on a global basis.

Kudlow responded, saying he didn't want to knock Obama, and that he likes the positives more than the negatives, but coming off a very deep recession like that [in 2008 when Obama was elected], we shouldn't have had 2-percent-or-less growth, which is what that administration produced.

Keyboard warriors on the left also flew into action, demanding that Facebook and other Big Tech overlords shame, silence and banish Trump and his complicit supporters.

And, of course, that is not the case. And you have some senators, Mark Kelly out in Arizona, Raphael Warnock in Georgia, that are going to be up in two years. And -- and so I -- you know, this -- this is still a very, obviously, closely divided Senate and I don't think they want to -- they want to jump off that bridge.
The new president signed an order Wednesday declaring the immediate termination of funding for the border wall. He also signed an order reversing Trump's previous order that directed aggressive immigration enforcement. In the coming days, he's promised to reverse Trump's asylum limitations and the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).

LANKSTON: Thank you for having me.
GM filings with the SEC reveal that GM was paying 7 percent interest on a $6.7 billion TARP debt. The filings also confirm that the source of funds for GM's debt repayments was a multibillion-dollar TARP-funded escrow account at Treasury; that means it was taxpayer money — not earnings.

But the first thing you do is get thousands of people fired at the stroke of a pen by ending the Keystone Pipeline, jump on the issue of -- of, you know, gender when it comes to sports and who can use what bathrooms and so forth and so on, an immigration order that I think could be read -- I've asked for clarification, I hope it doesn't mean this, but I think it could be read to say that someone whose committed a very serious crime, has raped or sexually abused a minor, as long as they were released from prison before the 19th of January, they're not a priority for deportation. Those are not centrist ideas.

VAN JONES, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Democrats have asked the court about the African-American vote. That is the cornerstone of our party. And in some ways, there is a feeling that maybe we have taken that vote for granted too long.
The fund, which Portnoy began with his own $500,000 contribution, has become a viral sensation, raising more than $18 million and aiding at least 74 small businesses across the country since Dec. 17.
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart. If you still disagree, so be it. That's democracy.
But first, Republican leaders will have to acknowledge that market capitalism is not a religion. Market capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster. You'd have to be a fool to worship it. Our system was created by human beings for the benefit of human beings. We do not exist to serve markets. Just the opposite. Any economic system that weakens and destroys families is not worth having. A system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.
It's unclear if the Treasury Department under Biden will allow the House access to the returns.

For that reason, getting distracted by side issues, like the minimum wage, would be a mistake. Bill Clinton made that blunder by talking about gays in the military at the very start of his term. Biden has plenty of time to fight cultural battles or try to pass an immigration bill that some conservatives are calling amnesty. But he's got one shot at the country's top priority.
Owning the libs doesn't mean giving them two free Senate seats, Trump 2020 national press secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox & Friends Weekend on Sunday, two days ahead of Georgia's crucial runoff elections, which will decide which party controls the Senate.
Buttigieg punched back at Sanders over the cost of his plans for America, but Buttigieg is still recovering from slight dip in support following criticism from Biden's camp over lack of experience. Biden saying yesterday Buttigieg is no Barack Obama.
And again, I think is the American people look at this, Chris, they're going to see this for what it is, President Trump said bring me all the ideas from both sides, let's put them all on the table. The president has made it clear what he would support.

Well, it's tempting to assume that the Speaker must have misspoken there. But it's hardly the first time she has said that. Immoral, immorality, she's used those words repeatedly.
All that Biden's proposal does is stimulate Washington and many of the governments in blue states in America, which have lockdown governors who have bankrupted their own states.
Well, it's a fascinating demographic. What basically happened is that strong Republican voters have moved further and further out to small towns and communities like Dalton or like Rome, like Gainesville, Gingrich told.
That's why so many Democrats are running for president and voters are already turning out in droves to see them.
But I do think the bigger issue here is the talk of impeachment.
Here's a look at how 100-day priorities have changed among Democrats over the years.
This is a rush transcript from Sunday Morning Futures, January 12, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.
No other president has ever had to contend with such intense attacks from so many different directions. President Trump, however, has survived the onslaught by staying true to the voters who elected him, delivering on promise after promise despite intense liberal resistance.
Or is it that you just don't give a damn?!
The stimulus would be a way to have an alternate message to the proposals from nearly every Democratic candidate looking to unseat Trump in the November election. Top-tier democrats are proposing massive increases in the size of government, with programs like Medicare for all, coupled with tax increases that will likely fall on the middle class.
So I think you've got to be pretty careful even recognizing the bounds of disagreement, to not do things that incite a great deal of unnecessary anger.
In return for such discussions, inmates and other officers testified that the 61-year-old was able to sit in a guard station after hours, eat Chinese take-out, and even use an electronic cigarette.
It comes back to delivering results, Feenstra said when asked why he ran against King. It's just critical for us to have a voice.

With military grade discipline, they shut down the City of Wuhan, home to 11 million people. The rest of the world watched this happen in real time, but yet assured themselves that everything was fine.
And I think most Americans are going to look at the Senate wasting our time on a trial to convict and remove from office a man who left office last week.

Now, as we said, there is an issue of policy needing to be fiscal in nature to qualify for budget reconciliation. In other words, you can't put a bill which deals with federal lands policy in budget reconciliation. And, it must be budget neutral. The measure cannot add to the deficit.

Every president's time in office is marked by high points and low points, but for President Trump there seemed to be no middle ground over the last 365 days. With a divided and highly-partisan Congress, a slew of crises both domestic and foreign, and a fast-approaching general election, Trump's 2019 was anything but tranquil.
SANDERS: That's a lot of questions.
President Obama's favorite justification for his executive action is that Congress failed to act. No, Mr. President, Congress did not fail to act, it chose not to act in granting amnesty.
What could have been a disaster for his administration and threatened to throw the economy into a downward spiral, ultimately ended up as a win for Trump. After 18 months of trade combat, the U.S. and China agreed to an interim truce in their trade war.

BARTIROMO: What would that open up a whole 'nother can of worms? I mean, obviously, this whole focus on the president and this impeachment trial has put Hunter Biden and Joe Biden to the backseat.

The topic has been a contentious one for the president since his time on the campaign trail in 2016, and throughout his administration, as he refuses to release his financial information.

Williamson: You ain't seen nothing yet - National Review: This is what happens when a relatively small group of federal workers don't get their paychecks. Imagine what it is going to look like when the Social Security checks stop coming. Around 2038, less than 20 years out, total spending on the major entitlements — Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid — plus interest on the debt will exceed all federal tax revenue. Put another way, come 2038, if we put every dollar Uncle Stupid collects in taxes toward Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest on the debt, all of that money combined will not cover those expenses. Fiscal Armageddon is coming.
Over 4 million jobs have been created since Donald Trump took office, with the lowest unemployment in half a century and earnings rising at the fastest rate in a decade. This is not by chance, but by policies that boosted business confidence and encouraged the hiring of American workers.
The government is in partial shutdown and full gridlock. The Mueller report is overdue. The Democrats are starting a raft of investigations. China is in a tailspin. Economists are predicting a recession and the stock market is gyrating. The generals are quitting over Syrian withdrawal plans.

And the more and more that our border becomes vulnerable and the less and less that we spend time and money protecting it, the more that we're going to have an influx, not just of terrorists but of human traffickers, drug inflow and people that are coming here to do American citizens harm.

Together with officials from the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing border patrol agents and staff, Trump insisted that we need protection in our country.

Emphasizing issues like health care helped Democrats win back the House of Representatives in November's midterm elections. So far the 2020 contenders seem to be following the 2018 playbook, rather than Clinton's 2016 strategy, when she spotlighted Trump as unfit to serve in the White House.
In addition, the president brought relative peace to the Middle East. He virtually destroyed ISIS and helped achieve remarkable peace agreements that will lead to diplomatic relations between four Muslim nations and Israel — an extraordinary accomplishment.

Now, before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. Study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. Maybe they should want to marry them, but they don't. Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out-of-wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that inevitably follow -- more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation.
Now, by the way, I think it's a mistake for conservatives not to take her seriously, to brush her off as kind of a flash in the pan or an upstart. She's as close to a thought leader that the Democratic Party has today, and she has a massive social media following. She's both charismatic, and she's committed to transforming both our economic system and our culture. First, she aims to create a socialist economic system with sky high marginal tax rates.

Exiting from the Paris climate accord: As a candidate, Trump promised to cancel the Paris Climate Agreement, a pact by nearly 200 nations to voluntarily reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change. Former President Barack Obama used his power as president to join the agreement without a vote in the legislature. Trump announced in June 2017 that the U.S. was pulling out of the agreement.
Bloomberg News reported the draft bill says, The lack of reciprocity in tariff levels and disproportionate use of non-tariff barriers by United States trading partners facilitates foreign imports, discourages United States exports, and puts United States producers, farmers, and workers at a competitive disadvantage.

I think also, though, I mean, stop and frisk, what he said on the tape was pretty awful. But people have known that he's been for that. And I think a lot of Democrats have already been worried about how he's going to respond to that.
There's a longstanding directive that any man, be it a lawmaker, aide, or journalist, entering the Speaker's Lobby, must wear a coat and tie. No one can cite a specific House rule codifying this sartorial mandate. The closest representation of this policy is an annotation in the House rulebook stemming from something House Speaker Tip O'Neill, D-Mass., uttered from the chair about proper attire in the 1970s.

What is fascinating is, his team has already come out and said that this isn't his forte. He's not great at public speaking. So they're already downplaying the expectations just a little bit.

And this is the witness Chairman Cummings can't wait to put on national television, so millions of Americans can hear him attack the president of the United States.
We sense the urgency of opening up the people's government so that they can be served by the agencies of government on which they rely, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters. The president has asked us to come down and meet tomorrow at 10:30. And we will do that. And we will have a discussion. Pelosi then interjected to remind Hoyer that the meeting was actually planned for 11:30 p.m. ET, and joked that Trump perhaps had told her the wrong time intentionally so that she would be absent.
But other Democrats have sounded notes of caution about Ocasio-Cortez in particular, given her willingness to spar with Democratic leaders and her relatively radical agenda.

Could Cory Booker be getting wifed up? - Page Six: Cory Booker and Rosario Dawson seem to be moving fast. Just on Sunday, The Post's Richard Johnson reported that the New Jersey senator and the movie star had been spotted together catching a movie at the Regal Union Square on Thursday. Now Page Six is told that Dawson was heard saying — or, more specifically, singing — 'I love you' to Booker. Spies at Saturday's performance of Broadway hit 'Dear Evan Hanson' say they were left in no doubt that Booker and Dawson — who brought Dawson's daughter and Booker's niece to see the show — are a couple. And after meeting the cast post-show, Dawson — who was walking across the empty stage on her way to the exit — began fooling around and singing a made-up song to Booker that went, 'I love you; te amo [as in, the Spanish for 'I love you'].' … While the source said that they didn't kiss while they were there, they said it was clear that they're an item.

Teachers of a second grade class in Taunton, Massachusetts gave an assignment to their class: Make a Christmas drawing, something that reminds you of the holidays. One of the 8-year-old students knew exactly what he'd draw. He and his family had just visited nearby National Shrine of Our Lady of La Salette where they have crucifixion statues. So, the little boy drew a stick figure Jesus hanging on the cross. Makes sense: Christmas is, after all, Jesus' birthday and the crucifix was fresh in his mind.

Building a border wall with Mexico's money: Trump's two-year anniversary comes amid the nation's longest-ever government shutdown as he and Democrats are at an impasse over funding for a border wall. The president has demanded more than $5 billion for the wall, which was one of his most oft-touted campaign promises. Trump also repeatedly said Mexico would pay for the wall. It remains unclear whether Trump will make progress on building more sections of a border wall during his time in office, but he has seemingly acknowledged Mexico won't directly pay for the project (though the president still maintains that money resulting from a new trade pact with Mexico can still cover costs).
PAUL: That's not a road -- that's not a road we should go down, but if you use the logic they're using against Trump, they would have to look in the mirror and look at all the times they've said, go fight, win, get up in their face, throw their food on the floor, assault them in restaurants, yell and scream at them, all the stuff that happened to my wife and I.

Let's first look at some history. The personal income tax was imposed in 1913. The top tax rate on the very rich was 7 percent. We were all promised then that the new income tax was a tax on the rich. The one percent. In today's dollars that 7% rate only hit those earning more than $11 million (sounds like the plan Democrats like AOC are pushing.) But within a few years, the lowest rate went above 7 percent. Today the bottom rate is 10 percent -- higher than the punitive tax rate that was supposed to hit only the Kennedy and Rockefeller kids.

The last time there was a real campaign finance scandal was during the 1996 election cycle when it was discovered that China funneled illegal contributions into our political system to help Bill Clinton and the Democrats' re-election efforts. That investigation resulted in more than 25 individuals being charged with crimes by the Department of Justice. In the wake of that investigation, President George W. Bush signed the unconstitutional McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform act into law, which was largely overturned by the Supreme Court in the Citizens United decision.

Mitt Romney refers to unwavering support for a finance-based economy and an internationalist foreign policy as the mainstream Republican view. And he's right about that.

The average citizen, on the other hand, just sees the GM CEO saying that GM has paid back the taxpayer in full. The truth is that GM originally received over $49 billion from the US government and many billions remain to be recouped.

Now, however, by granting legal status to roughly half the nation's population of illegal immigrants, Obama is twisting the law, ignoring the Constitution, and forsaking his primary responsibility as chief executive. For years, he argued publicly it would be unconstitutional for him to take such action because he said, I'm president, I'm not king. Apparently, he now favors a crown on his noggin.

Two years after Trump entered the White House his actions have most of America caught between hope and despair. Some believe midnight in America is indeed coming because of his actions.

[Ed. note: It certainly does seem unfair that the individuals responsible for the shutdown are not among those affected by the shutdown itself. Shutdowns were introduced to our budgeting process as a bipartisan penalty for intransigence. Nobody is supposed to want a shutdown. But as our government has lost the capacity for budgeting and other normal fiscal duties, shutdowns have become a more significant part of our experience. That's because since the 1990s, parties have considered shutdowns as political opportunities. We score these events like games: Which team won and which team lost. The idea is that no one is supposed to win. A shutdown is an embarrassment and a reflection of governmental incompetence. What's obvious now is that those ideas carry less sting then they did 40 years ago when they were instituted. So maybe we need to, as you suggest, increase the pain.]
The tax has been a long-time goal of Murphy's. Last year, he wanted to implement a millionaire's tax with a top rate of 10.75 percent, however, amid disagreements with the state legislature, which threatened to shut down the state government, Murphy agreed to sign the budget without it.

But especially, a National Security Adviser, you can't have him explaining all of your statements about national security concerning Russia, China, North Korea, everything. We just can't do that. I think for the good of the office. Look, Nancy Pelosi will go down as probably the least successful Speaker of the House in the history of our nation. She has done nothing. The only thing she's done is she finally get done one of the best trade deals our country has ever made, the USMCA. That's with Mexico and Canada. But I did that. She doesn't even know what it says. She has no idea what it says. She was forced to do that. You know why? She wouldn't have done it, but she did nothing. So, now she can say, I signed something. She is obsessed with impeachment. She has done nothing. She's going to go down as one of the worst Speakers in the history of our country. Now, in all fairness, she's hurting our country. She's very bad for our country and she's become a crazed lunatic.

Long before the Supreme Court ruled in a highly questionable 2007 case, Massachusetts v. EPA, that the EPA has the legal authority to justify its proposed 18,000 pages of greenhouse gas regulation under the Clean Air Act, Browner (then EPA director under President Bill Clinton) had her general counsel, Jonathan Cannon, prepare a now-infamous memorandum arguing�for the first time�that the EPA possessed such a power. At the time it was dismissed as a wild-eyed overreach that Congress would never allow. Now it's happening, and Browner is right at the center of it.
The Heritage Foundation attempted to use the Energy Information Administration's National Energy Model to forecast the impact of steep carbon taxes aimed at reaching the net-zero greenhouse gas emissions goal. Not only did the model crash, it failed to approach anywhere near the goal outlined in the Green New Deal. The closest Heritage was able to get was a 58 percent reduction in emissions, achieved through a $300 carbon tax -- taxes above $300 crashed the EIA's model.

With respect, congresswoman, I feel like the answer could be, if it's not an acceptable offer from the president, that's fine, the Democrats should counter offer with something as opposed to with nothing at all. Today in The Washington Post, the editorial board, which is not a right wing editorial board, they wrote, quote, Trump's offer should be welcomed, if not the final word, to refuse to even talk until the government reopens does no favors to sideline federal workers and contractors.

De Blasio's announcement came after California's new Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom outlined a similarly ambitious health care agenda for his state, aimed at offering more benefits to illegal immigrants and protecting ObamaCare.

However, the problem with wrecking balls is that unless they are controlled by a skilled operator, they can swing backward and harm the person controlling them. That's a good description of what Trump has done throughout his presidency, from some of his tweets to some of his more inflammatory statements — and especially after he stirred the pot that helped inspire the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.

Many Democrats have abandoned that truth. They have replaced it with socialism — the opposite of capitalism and economic freedom. Their economic agenda is based on the idea of control.

But beyond the economy, and despite the endless claims of the elitist establishment that the swamp is not being drained, the president did follow through there, as well.

Now, Joe Biden now supports -- to recap -- a presidential impeachment, divisive, no unity there. And, of course, the smear campaign that goes along with it as he only listens to the fringe socialist leftist policies he's hearing every day, adding D.C. as a state, ending the filibuster, using executive orders, bypassing Congress and other branch of government, enacting a radical pro-illegal immigration and amnesty policy, and his anti-energy green new deal agenda that will ultimately cost you trillions of dollars.

Unfortunately, some governors are injecting these vaccines in slow motion. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., has failed so extravagantly that expired vials have landed in the trash.
Both President Biden and Speaker Pelosi are Catholics, with Biden becoming the second Catholic president in U.S. history this week. But their promotion of pro-choice policies have brought them into conflict with members of the Church hierarchy.
People close to the Trump campaign believe the tax cut proposals could also help spur the markets and the economy on the prospect that a second term will include additional stimulus.
Still, people with direct knowledge of the matter say the White House will likely want to showcase a tax-cut proposal — particularly one that targets the middle class — as a way of contrasting the fiscal policies advocated by most Democrats looking to oust President Trump. Leading Democratic candidates are proposing massive increases to the size of the federal government, including payroll tax increases, which affects all wage earners, not just the rich.

Smithsonian: ['Drunk History,' the Comedy Central show whose sixth season premieres January 15] features guests, often celebrities, telling historical tales while drinking with host Derek Waters and a cast re-enacting the stories as they're told, lip-synching to the narration. … Waters first got the idea for 'Drunk History' when his friend 'New Girl' actor Jake Johnson drunkenly tried to tell him a story about Otis Redding's 1967 plane crash death. When Waters told another actor friend, Michael Cera of 'Arrested Development' fame, about it, they decided to shoot an episode with Cera playing Alexander Hamilton in a retelling of his fatal duel with Aaron Burr (this was, it should be noted, eight years before Hamilton's Off-Broadway debut). The clip blew up online with the help of Cera's star power, on the rise in 2007 thanks to Superbad and Juno; it's gotten more than 7.5 million views on YouTube to date.

As the partial government shutdown continues, a handful of Republican senators have broken with President Trump in demanding a spending deal – even without funding for a border wall.
Markets have been swelling since Trump was elected in 2016, spiking initially on his plans to cut taxes and loosen regulations. In 2017, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which took corporate taxes down to 21 percent from 35 percent and reduced most individual rates, which further boosted stocks even as concerns over a trade war, particularly with China, dampened stocks until recently when the Trump Administration announced a trade-war truce with Bejing.

Further remarks from Sanders were aimed at Bloomberg's opposition to Barack Obama's tax increases on the wealthy, his support for cuts to Social Security and Medicare, and what Sanders said was Bloomberg's insistence that the 2007-09 financial crisis was caused by the end of the banking practice of red-lining – thuse making loans more accessible to low-income people -- rather than the misdeeds of crooks on Wall Street.
Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow responded on Friday to former President Obama's tweet, which credited his administration with paving the way for more than a decade of economic growth.

He also tweeted: If the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level. Two can play that game!

In fact, the president Tuesday celebrated 452 miles of steel and concrete wall along the southern frontier. This distance roughly separates Manhattan from Greensboro, N.C., and connects San Diego and San Francisco. Consequently, federal apprehensions and encounters on the U.S.-Mexico border have plunged from 977,509 in fiscal year 2019 to 458,088 in fiscal year 2020 — down 53.1%.
But President Trump does not need magic to get results for American workers and families. He and Republicans in Congress delivered the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which resulted in pay raises, bonuses, and benefits for millions of Americans. The legislation simplified the federal tax code and encouraged entrepreneurs to launch and grow their businesses.

And by the way, remember, they used to say we pay for it. No, no. China devalued their currency and they pay for it. And we have a great relationship with China right now. So I don't want to speak badly of anyone, but they are having the worst year that they've had. The last year was the worst year they've had in 67, it was 57, now it's 67 years. And they wanted to make a deal, and we made a deal. And it's a great deal. Now we have a phase two deal which will start at some point, but phase one was very important for banking.

Most important, he is right about the threat from China. Viewed from the perspective of great power relations, his entire presidency has been about getting America to face the comprehensive challenge stemming from Beijing, and its strategy for displacing America as the world's dominant superpower. In fact, it represents the most comprehensive grand strategy for confronting and defeating a competing superpower since Ronald Reagan's grand strategy toward the Soviet Union.

I mean, it's having real consequences not only to the federal workers, but to the contrary, in terms of food stamps, in terms of tax refunds, in terms of the safety at the airports with the TSA. I mean, there are real consequences to a prolonged shutdown. The president doesn't seem to understand that but it's really impacting small business. It's impacting people's lives.

Dealing with a hostile administration will certainly be challenging, especially in contrast to the past four years.

What do you think of the prospects for that and eventually, because you know that the Senate Republicans are going to block some legislation, some of the stuff that -- that Joe Biden is talking about as a national emergency, at a certain point do you think Senate Democrats are just going to not be able to restrain themselves and try to kill the filibuster?
Without getting rid of the filibuster, most major legislation needs to overcome a 60-vote procedural threshold to advance to a final vote. Even if all Democrats are united, they would need buy-in from 10 Republicans to advance big legislation to overcome the cloture rule.

Twenty percent of likely Democratic caucus goers support the Vermont senators, that's according to the latest Des Moines Register/CNN poll. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is in second place with 17 percent, and former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is third with 16 percent, and former V.P. Joe Biden has 15 percent. The Iowa caucuses are on February 3rd. Meantime, Texas is cracking down on new refugees. Governor Greg Abbott says his state is already overwhelmed and is now rejecting resettlements.

I said to Saudi Arabia, we have a very good relationship with Saudi Arabia, I said listen, you're a very rich country. You want more troops. I'm going to send them to you. But you've got to pay us. They're paying us. They've already deposited $1 billion in the bank. We are going to help them, but these rich countries have to pay for it. South Korea gave us $500 million.

SANDERS: Chris, we've been having this debate for years. At some point, we have to say, enough is enough. Until we can come together, we can be reasonable, which we have put forth in good faith multiple offers to Democrats to say, let's make a deal. Let's have a discussion; let's get to a place where we agree.
She was able to confirm part of Biden's radical agenda, which raises the question -- well, when he was hiding in his basement, maybe the news mob and maybe those people in big tech, maybe they should have made a big deal because apparently, Joe is on board with D.C. becoming the 51st state.

Power to lead foreign aid efforts - AP: President-elect Joe Biden announced Wednesday that he has picked Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President Barack Obama, to run the agency overseeing American foreign humanitarian and development aid.

Biden also announced that he is elevating the position to the National Security Council within the White House, a signal that he will prioritize outreach to other nations.

The electoral college system for electing presidents is an essential part of our federalist system of government and was a key component to the passage of the Constitution in 1787. The electoral college enhances the power of voters in smaller states. Without the electoral college, voters in a handful of highly populated states would have significantly more power to determine the outcome of every presidential election, which is exactly what Democrats want. About three in 10 votes cast in the 2016 election occurred in just seven Democratic-leaning states: California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Virginia and Washington State.

Biden's proposals will lift the national debt to above $30 trillion and will likely speed America further along the track to bankruptcy, higher interest rates, higher inflation and much higher taxes.

Sen. Rick Scott said the alleged actions of a Florida nursing home to distribute vaccines to wealthy donors instead of elderly residents is absolutely disgusting, and called for a congressional investigation.
The Democratic investigations and impeachment mantras are starting up. Depending upon what is in his tax returns, Trump will release them and laugh or fight it all the way to the Supreme Court. Most of the Congressional subpoenas will be ignored and slow-walked. No doubt an impeachment would be a crowd pleaser for the Democratic base and Trump could face some manic days with the release of the Mueller report, just as Bill Clinton faced tough days after Ken Starr released his report. But absent something dramatic and new, Trump Acquitted is the likely headline out a Senate trial, so Democrats will think twice about going down this road. Censure might be a logical way out, but I'm not sure logic will prevail.
Imagine what would have happened if Trump had issued his peaceful transfer of power statement before his supporters descended on Washington. There would have been no need for them to storm the Capitol, and no need for Republicans doing his bidding to challenge the Electoral College results.

RAY: Well, it's a big deal because, ultimately, in the eyes of history, we are all going to be judged about whether or not we acted in the best interests of the country. I think the president's principal defense -- and you saw it in the answer that was interposed over the weekend -- is very simple. This is an entirely partisan and, therefore, illegitimate effort by House Democrats to remove a president from office. And the remedy for that is the United States Senate, as envisioned by the framers of the Constitution. In order to overturn the will of the electorate in the 2016 election, and particularly given the fact that we are now in the middle of a presidential campaign for 2020, ultimately, that will can only be overturned with a bipartisan effort and overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate, with a two-thirds majority, in order to remove a president and overturn the will of that electorate.

Despite progressive pushes for sweeping legislative changes, the chances of getting something like Medicare-for-All or a Green New Deal passed are very slim.

The answer used to be obvious. The overriding goal for America is more prosperity, meaning cheaper consumer goods. But is that still true?

If Biden follows the course laid out by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, social media censors, and his rabid supporters shrieking continuously against Trump and Republicans, it will only widen the political civil war we're waging.

So when the Senate approved in January a new trade bill, which has come to be called USMCA, the president got a major policy victory right before his impeachment trial was slated to start. Among other things, the agreement aims to have more cars produced in the United States, where workers earn an average of at least $16 an hour. It also secured changes that require Mexico to change its laws to make it easier for workers to form independent unions, which should improve worker conditions and wages and reduce the incentive for U.S. companies to relocate their plants.

Airbnb cancels all inauguration bookings - Politico: Airbnb announced Wednesday that it would cancel all reservations in the Washington, D.C., area during the week of Joe Biden's inauguration to discourage guests from traveling to the nation's capital. The popular home rental company said in a statement that it would also take action to block any new reservations from being made in the area. Guests who made reservations prior to the new decision will have their stays refunded, and hosts will be compensated by the company for money they would have earned from the canceled reservations. The move follows pleas from local authorities, including Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, strongly discouraging travel to the city after last week's deadly riots at the U.S. Capitol. Airbnb also announced that it had banned 'numerous individuals' from its platform who participated in the insurrection or were linked to known hate groups.

DEADLY PILEUP ON I-75: At least seven people were killed and seven others were injured Thursday in a multivehicle crash on Interstate 75 near Gainesville, Florida, investigators said ... The Florida Highway Patrol said two tractor-trailer rigs and two passenger vehicles were involved in the crash, which unfolded about a mile south of Alachua. Alachua County Fire Rescue reported that flames ignited after 50 gallons of diesel fuel spilled on the highway. Emergency crews extinguished the fire and said they were treating the crash as a homicide investigation, but did not say why. The fire was so intense that authorities said it damaged parts of the road. At one point, the Alachua County Sheriff's Office dispatched a helicopter to look for potential victims in the woods off the highway. - Reported by Samuel Chamberlain

The older Democratic party focused on equality of opportunity, economic growth and targeted tax cuts. Today's party demands equality of outcome and redistribution of wealth.
The lengthy arguments from Schiff and other House Democrats broke little new ground, if any. Trump's lawyers sat by, waiting their turn, as the president blasted the proceedings from afar, jokingly threatening to face off with the Democrats by coming to sit right in the front row and stare at their corrupt faces.
In addition to the constant deluge of hit pieces in the media, President Trump has also had to contend with Democratic lawmakers, judges and unelected bureaucrats who are equally committed to seeing him fail — regardless of the consequences for ordinary Americans.
That corruption is why guys like Perdue, who said under oath he spent most of [his] career outsourcing jobs, were allowed to destroy American manufacturing and send American jobs to foreign countries.

Many Democrats also see legalization of marijuana as a new way to generate more tax revenue to grow government, and they don't care if people are harmed.

I agree with your very cogent assessment of our educational system especially when it comes to the teaching of history and government in our public schools. I can remember the name of every one of my history teachers in high school, 'Coach.' It wasn't until I got to college that I was taught history by a Historian. Parents and teachers should know that it takes more than reading a single textbook that barely summarizes historical events to have a firm knowledge of our country's past, or the mechanisms of our complex system of government. Parents and Grandparents should demand that our children and grandchildren become literate in History and Civics. That will not happen unless Parents and Grandparents re-educate themselves and become literate in History and Civics so that intelligent discussions can take place in the home. I'd like to suggest that a reading list for everyone that starts with a copy of the Constitution and the Federalist Papers would be in order. – Ron Gay, College Station, Texas

That's separate from portraying yourself as a centrist.

As a 'reasonable Democrat' (and a regular reader of your Halftime Report) I enjoy and appreciate seeing multiple points of view on the government's topics of the day. I've always tried to approach these topics with the understanding that those with opinions different than mine aren't wrong, they simply have a different way of going about achieving the same ultimate goal, making America a better place. With so much divisiveness in our politics, it's so heartening to see someone with access to the masses reminding people that 'You might consider the possibility that those with whom you disagree are sincere.' which I've seen you do multiple times, increasingly in recent months, though not in such an explicit way as you did in response to a reader's email in yesterday's edition. Please keep banging this drum! Bang it loud enough so that people on BOTH sides of the aisle, both in public service and in the press can hear it and will want to join in.

What are you expecting?

Sanders, like Trump, has talked a good game but never managed to get anything done in his congressional career that helped working families, or anyone for that matter. While Warren doesn't mention either one by name in her speeches – and there is a real chance that neither one of them will run in 2020 – the contrast couldn't be more clear.
But I think science shows that, too. I think the great thing is we've gotten better with technology, with ultrasounds. You can see from the earliest stages how this life from conception continues to grow and is, yes, inside a mother's womb. But as a separate individual human being. And just for people to say trust the science, I think you have to say that is a separate and distinct individual -- very dependent upon mother, but a life that must be respected.

TRUMP: Honestly, he's going to spend money one way or the other. I mean, he doesn't have the personality for this. He doesn't -- he can't relate to people. He probably inherently dislikes people. So he just doesn't have the retail side of it, which is a big part of it. You can't -- he doesn't have a stage presence. He doesn't have that personality. So he will spend a lot of money, but what's he going to spend it against? And that's the reality.
And as you saw in the presidential debates the Democrats had, they view it as something that cannot be tolerated in their party for a candidate to be pro-life. They just primaried Dan Lipinski and beat him. And in Tennessee, they unseated the long-serving Democratic member, removed him from the legislature over the objection of voters. They disqualified him from holding office and the Tennessee legislature within their party.

The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.

Number one, Chris Wray actually has taken care of a lot of the senior leadership at the FBI that we all know was part of that corrupt cabal of Strzok, Comey, Page that we have been fighting against for so long, but then also wasn't real clear on what he's going to do on how -- besides implementing the instructions from the Horowitz report, is there other things that can be done?
My problem with the package has to do with some of the things I think will be harmful, actually. I mean take the $15 federal minimum wage proposal, Chris. You know, restaurants have been one of the hardest hit industries over the past year and they rely on a lot of low skill workers. And a $15 minimum wage will make it more difficult for them to find workers because these low skill workers will be priced out of -- out of the labor force. So I don't think something like that is helpful. Or extending unemployment benefits -- or supplementing unemployment benefits that discourage people from returning -- returning to work because they're being paid more to stay home. So -- so some of this I don't think deserves to pass, but some of it should and some of it I think will.

In 2010, for example, Mitt Romney made about $22 million dollars in investment income. He paid an effective federal tax rate of 14 percent. For normal upper-middle-class wage earners, the federal tax rate is nearly 40 percent. No wonder Mitt Romney supports the status quo. But for everyone else, it's infuriating.

However, Pelosi, even as she said she would be willing to fund border security, called a border wall a symptom of an old way of thinking and promised not to fund it.
As early as the 1950s, Britain began to privatize its social security and pension programs. By the 1990s, as decades of socialism caused economic growth to stagnate, Sweden followed suit. Neither Sweden nor Norway mandates a minimum wage, and Britain demands a minimum wage well below Ocasio-Cortez's proposed $15 per hour. Britain and Finland offer a lower corporate tax rate than the United States, and all the nations she names have lower rates than her proposal of 28 percent. None has a health care regime as socialistic as her proposed Medicare-For-All scheme, which constitutes a full federal takeover of health care.

For a variety of reasons, the people in charge of this country didn't want to talk about it. So instead, they told us that the biggest thing happening on Jan. 4, 2020 was the impeachment of Donald Trump, and nothing was more important than removing him from office. Trump's crime, you may remember, was a 30-minute phone call with the president of Ukraine. In that call, Trump suggested there might be something corrupt about Joe Biden's son making $40,000 a month from a Ukrainian energy company, despite having no relevant work history in either Ukraine or the energy business.

Creating a commission on radical Islam: Trump said one of his first acts as president would be to establish a commission on radical Islam – which will include reformist voices in the Muslim community who will hopefully work with us. As of now, there is no such commission.

TRUMP: And she'll be overthrown pretty soon, because she's doing very little. And the people are tired of it. And she's controlled by the radical Left. She's controlled by AOC. She's controlled by this Tlaib, it's another great one and she's controlled by Omar.

Now, imagine an 8-year-old boy. He must have been so excited to see how the teachers would react. Like Ralphie in the movie A Christmas Story, eager to win his teacher's approval of the Red Rider story he concocted. And just like when Ralphie's teacher responded with a You'll shoot your eyes out reaction, this boy was also completely devastated. Instead of reacting with praise, the teachers immediately sent him home and ordered that he undergo a psychological evaluation.
His four-party coalition resigned Friday over a scandal involving thousands of parents wrongly being labeled fraudsters by the country's tax office. It remains in office until a new coalition is formed following a March 17 general election.
Those tax cuts, coupled with the Trump administration's regulatory rollbacks, have spurred remarkable economic growth in the United States. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 2.8 million full-time jobs were created from January 2018 to December 2018 – 688,000 more than the number of jobs created during the same period in 2017.
In fact, in late 2018 Trump did more to lift up the poor than any of his predecessors, including President Lyndon Johnson, who launched the War on Poverty.
That arrogance doesn't play well in Pennsylvania, and it doesn't work in most flyover states – like Michigan and Wisconsin, which Clinton did in fact fly right over in her 2016 campaign. The good people of Michigan and Wisconsin returned the favor on Election Day when they ignored her and threw their historically blue states to Trump.
But, first, we turn our attention this Friday night to the Democrats' top agenda item, that is the unconstitutional impeachment Schiff show, and apparently nothing unifies the country like a new divisive Senate trial to remove a former president from an office he no longer holds -- an amazing use of your hard-earned taxpayer dollars and government resources, also in the middle of a pandemic.
And, there's not -- we don't have any specific intelligence that there's
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Frankly, when he speaks, a lot of what he is saying is tasteless (ph) and very sad. And we have heard a lot about death and cancer and people losing their job. And to me, he doesn't really seem very solution-oriented in how to fix those problems. I don't think he has the momentum to carry this to a national election.

The administration policies on tax cuts and deregulation have been good for both Wall Street and Main Street, economist David Henderson, who served on President Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, told FOX Business. He said the big improvement came even despite an expensive trade war.

The federal government right now, we're having big things that have occurred over the last 10 or 15 years. And you can't continue to go in debt. So one of my top priorities is balancing the budget, trying to create a means to get down that path.

Gupta is a former American Civil Liberties Union and NAACP lawyer who is currently the head of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.

BENSON: Well, it's a black eye for BuzzFeed. There's no question about that. And, you're right, this story hung out there for hours and hours and hours and then into the next day. And beyond just that, another thing that smelled a little fishy was the two journalists who reported the story seemed to contradict each other the next day about whether or not they had seen the supposed documentary evidence that allegedly backed up this explosive claim. One said we didn't see it. One said they did. That was odd.
But Justice Democrats has also campaigned for progressive California Rep. Katie Porter to join the financial services committee, a goal that was achieved on Tuesday.
It is far from clear how GM and the Obama administration could honestly say, much less trumpet in prime time television ads, that GM repaid its TARP loans in any meaningful way. The reality is that GM got additional TARP billions from a Treasury escrow account filled with taxpayer dollars. Taxpayers have not been paid back in full and are still on the hook for the TARP stock investment in GM. Whether taxpayer funds are ultimately recovered depends upon the administration's ability to sell GM stock at a profit some day. Of course, we all hope it works out that way, and it might. But, the American people deserve more than puffed-up press releases and misleading commercials claiming that GM paid its loans back to the government with money it earned. I recognize that one of the goals of the GM ad campaign is to build trust, but GM did it all wrong, apparently with some help from the administration. Shifting bailout money from GM debt to GM stock is not the same as repaying it. Stock is riskier than debt. Maybe it's a good idea. Maybe it's a step in the right direction, maybe not. Only time will tell. But, we should be clear with the American people about what happened here.

I don't think Mitt Romney's going to challenge Donald Trump in 2020. That's just my instinct. I do think John Kasich might. I think Jeff Flake might. And a lot will depend on the Mueller report.

Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski told her hometown newspaper.
By the time the smoke cleared yesterday, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and more than 100 congressional Democrats were both calling for Trump to be removed through the 25th Amendment, or face a swift impeachment. But that just made it sound like the same old partisan dynamic of the first impeachment and both outcomes seemed remote. With less than two weeks until the inauguration, such an effort would have to be led by Trump's Cabinet, and that chatter is going nowhere.

ANALYST DISILLUSIONED WITH JOURNALISM AND 'TRUMP CIRCUS': Longtime military analyst William Arkin has stepped down from his role at NBC News with a scathing letter criticizing the current state of journalism as well as President Donald Trump ... Arkin, a U.S. Army veteran who has worked for NBC as a reporter and commentator over the course of three decades, wrote a 2,228-word internal memo obtained by CNN on Wednesday, declaring that the world and the current state of journalism have been in tandem crisis. My expertise, though seeming to be all the more central to the challenges and dangers we face, also seems to be less valued at the moment. And I find myself completely out of synch with the network, being neither a day-to-day reporter nor interested in the Trump circus, Arkin wrote. - Reported by Joseph A. Wulfsohn

PAUL: You know, I can't characterize the private call, but all I can say is Kentucky, 63 percent of us voted for the president. We listened to the speech, we've watched it, and we don't think politicians can be responsible when crazy people do crazy things.
TRUMP: Yes. By the way, I love that they collude against themselves in this way, because the last time they colluded to rig the Democrat primary, it worked out perfectly for us because we got Hillary, and that was a godsend.
Is it your intention to always tell the truth from that podium, and will you pledge never to knowingly something that is not factual?
TRUMP: Well, I think it's ridiculous. She should have sent them a long time ago. It just - it belittles the process. What they've done to impeachment. It's like I was interviewed by a very, very good writer, reporter somebody that you know very well. I can say Bob Woodward. He said, he's doing something and this time, I said maybe I'll sit down, because nobody has done more than me. I mean nobody - if you look at three years with the economy, with regulations, with the tax cuts, with everything, and all the things, we've rebuilt our military. Our military was totally depleted. Our military was old and depleted. And he said you know you don't look like somebody who's under impeachment, as you know he's slightly covered Nixon and he covered Clinton. But Bob Woodward, he said, you actually look like you've won everything, you look happy. I said, I am happy. So maybe I'm wired a little bit different.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., balked at the notion that Republicans are now concerned about socialism for rich people when he said they were OK passing huge tax breaks for corporations.

It's far too early to discern whether this constitutes a Trump Doctrine, comparable to the Reagan Doctrine of the 1980s. But after two decades of self-delusion about America's ability to get along with China, even to treat it as a strategic partner, this strategy is the key legacy that Trump will leave to his successors, Democrat or Republican. When all is said, it may even be the key to his ultimate place in American history.

We may not have a lot of the bells and whistles we normally have, but just take a little time travel and pretend you are back in the 1950s, and you will feel very comfortable about that.
She later told reporters it's exciting that Democrats have so many ideas and so many people who want to get out and talk about them.
My conservative friends believe the greatest threat to America comes from President-elect Joe Biden and the far-left radicals supporting him.

New York will require all employers to offer paid sick leave, while nearby Connecticut expanded its paid family leave program.
If rural, more conservative areas see a large surge in turnout on Election Day, then that will be a key for Loeffler and Perdue to win. If the turnout among those groups is closer to that of urban areas, it will be a good sign for Ossoff and Warnock as they will likely lead in votes not cast on Election Day.
And I also believe that the Senate do not wish, at least Senate Democrats do not wish to see the same replay as they witnessed back in 2009 where basically one person can block the -- all of the good ideas that come forward. So Democrats will have to continue to keep their option on the table to eliminate the filibuster. The -- the framers never intended for us to -- to have super majorities in order to get things done.

This was started when the mainstream media dropped any pretense of being unbiased and actually chose sides during this election, Johnson told Todd.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., reignited the call for a Green New Deal during her surge to Congress in the midterm elections. Her plan is a lofty one, calling for the federal government to invest trillions of dollars. In turn, she says, millions of high-wage jobs will be created. She compared her plan to the Marshall Plan, or the European Recovery Plan, where the U.S. gave around $15 billion to help Western Europe recover in the aftermath of World War II.
ROMNEY: Well, that will be up to the prosecutors, of course, but I think it's pretty clear that over the last year or so, there has been an effort to corrupt the election of the United States and it was not by President Biden, it was by President Trump. And that corruption we saw with regards to the conduct in Ukraine as well as the call to Secretary of State Raffensperger as well as the incitation to insurrection.
Instead, we now get Phase 7 of debt spending — and Biden wants another trillion-dollar infrastructure bill to follow. (Doesn't it seem like just yesterday that Democrats opposed President Trump's tax cut because it would increase the deficit?) Those faux debt hawks have sure flown the coop.
And yet, and here's the bewildering and infuriating part, those very same affluent married people, the ones making virtually all the decisions in our society, are doing pretty much nothing to help the people below them get and stay married. Rich people are happy to fight malaria in Congo. But working to raise men's wages in Dayton or Detroit? That's crazy.

For example, mandating a $15 federal minimum wage would wipe out small businesses hanging by a thread. It would cut into already contracted business income, forcing local retailers and restaurants to stop hiring and forget about reopening or expanding a small business. At worst, many may close their doors for good. A shuttered Main Street business diminishes economic vitality and means no jobs, no paychecks and no tax revenue.
So, yes, we need to make sure this doesn't happen because this is a terrible precedent and if we do this, if we say, oh, the president's speech incited violence, we need to examine then Bernie Sanders speech and Cory Booker's speech and Maxine Water's speech.

Gallup summed the situation up nicely: Rarely in the years that Gallup has tracked public ratings of the economy, since the early 1990s, have Americans had higher confidence in the economy than they do now.

Ending the fossil-fuel industry would potentially destroy millions of jobs and require an unprecedented investment in expensive and unreliable renewable energy sources like wind and solar power generation. Even worse, because wind and solar cost two to five times more than existing conventional energy sources, requiring huge sectors of the economy to rely on these renewables would increase the cost of all goods and services and drive countless businesses out of the country.

Members of our educated upper-middle-classes are now the backbone of the Democratic Party who usually describe themselves as fiscally responsible and socially moderate.

As far as they're concerned, these are two totally separate categories.

The 2012 Mitt Romney presidential campaign spent nearly $450 million. The 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign spent about $585 million. The Trump 2020 campaign spent just under $775 million, which is similar to what both Obama campaigns spent.

After President Trump fulfilled his constitutional duty by nominating Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court, Sens.

We can also note that he has deep personal flaws. He is impatient, impulsive, self-centered, and at times irresponsible: this a serious flaw for a president who leads the world's largest superpower and whose every off-hand remark or impulse reverberates in world capitals, whether friends or foes.

At the same time, our caucus is big and diverse and people are bringing their passions and reflecting the strong feelings of their constituents, and there are a number of people who think we should move quickly on impeachment. I'm one of the people who think we have to wait for Mr. Mueller to complete his report so we know all the facts before we take any action.
SLOTKIN: I think the tenor and tone that the president has set is just unbecoming of the country that I love. And, for me, that's critically important. I don't like policy by Twitter, but, to me, just because you're providing a check and balance on the president doesn't mean you don't have a responsibility to legislate and get something affirmative done. If we're only anti-Trump, we are not doing our job.

Consider his self-incriminating statements on immigration and executive powers. A year ago, when asked if he had the authority to end deportations of illegal aliens he said, Actually, I don't. Three years earlier, when pressed as to why he could not act on his own on immigration he said, The notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true.

Reconciliation provides a fast-track process to consider bills to implement the policy choices embodied in the annual congressional budget resolution.

MIKE HUCKABEE: Nikki [Haley] is spot on. That's exactly what we need to be focused upon and I wish that since the election the president would've reminded America of the four years of things that he has done.

However, President Obama has commandeered this elastic doctrine of prosecutorial discretion and stretched or manipulated it beyond all recognition and reason. It has become his political Gumby toy with which he exerts his will whenever he fails to get his way with Congress. He contorts the word discretion to adopt a capacious policy -- his own policy -- to ban full enforcement of a duly enacted immigration statute. He treats the doctrine as a magical incantation shielding his arbitrariness.

While the economy has been strong under Trump's policies of lower taxes and slashing regulations, Young cites a report by ImpactEcon that projected Trump's tariff policies would reduce economic growth by 1.78 percent in 2019. So, Young said, without tariffs, gross domestic product could exceed an astounding 5 percent.
CLYBURN: No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying yes to the first part. To the second part, it seemed as if the president started talking about barriers in a statement yesterday. And as you realize, I have been talking about barriers for a long time. A smart wall will be a barrier. A smart wall would be using drones, using sensors, using X-ray equipment to be an effective wall.

Democratic leaders have previously supported building border walls. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and other Democrats, including then-Sens.

As of 2015, virtually all of that fencing had been completed, according to government figures.

Finally, the Democratic left is rising as the presidential cycle is starting. Yet it is the moderates who won a rules change that stops the left from holding no confidence votes on the speaker, undercutting the power of splinter groups to disrupt the caucus. It is the moderates who won the seats that put the House back in Democratic hands, and while the left may dominate the early presidential cycle and in the media cycles, I think it's the moderates who will emerge to push for getting things done for the country on infrastructure, immigration and health care.
Now, joining us, Texas Governor Greg Abbott. He's ordering the return of National Guard troops from Texas, and it's also slamming Biden's dangerous open borders amnesty agenda that will make us the united sanctuary states of America, writing, quote: President Biden is trying to halt deportations of illegal immigrants who already have a final order of removal, illegal aliens, but reading exact words, from the U.S. This abandons the obligation to enforce federal immigration laws.

However, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., appeared to side with Thompson's position Wednesday on Fox News' Special Report with Bret Baier, arguing that border walls obviously work in some areas and rejecting suggestions that barriers should be removed where they already exist.

But he added that what I do appreciate about Iowa and New Hampshire is that people take politics and policy very seriously, and these are relatively small states as far as states go, so that you can actually meet people one on one and get to know them.
Here's one question: How exactly did Joe Biden win more votes than any other presidential candidate in the history of the United States? After 50 years of uninterrupted mediocrity in Washington and two spectacularly unsuccessful presidential campaigns in which he was rejected resolutely by Democratic primary voters, did Americans suddenly decide they wanted to be led by Joe Biden?

President Trump has rebuilt the federal judiciary by appointing judges committed to the true, original meaning of the Constitution, including two brilliant Supreme Court justices. He has renegotiated unfair trade deals, passed historic tax cuts, and cut unnecessary job-killing regulations, creating the strongest economy and the lowest unemployment rate in generations. Now, he is fighting to get the Washington establishment to give the American people the border wall they voted for in 2016.

Ocasio-Cortez had voted with Khanna to oppose the so-called pay-go rule included in the rules package, supported by Pelosi.

CARLSON: Interesting. Are you confident that the administration has a sense of how many people might be infected in the United States?
GABBARD: I don't know what those tapes said.
ABBOTT: You know, it's amazing because Biden has talked about taking down this wall despite the fact that for one that would pose serious challenges with regard to the open border issue that we're fighting back against. But, secondly, it would burden taxpayers with increased tax dollars being spent to do something that is a valuable tool in our ongoing fight against immigration that is illegal.
Of course, no economic recovery lasts forever, but this economy is robust, not overheated; there is a lot of room for growth going forward, and it will continue to benefit Americans regardless of race, age sex or financial status. As the Fox News and Gallup polls demonstrate, the American people get this despite ongoing efforts to convince them either that it isn't happening or that it can't last.
As a resolution, the Green New Deal doesn't enact any particular policies but directs Congress to pursue many goals such as universal health care, which Ocasio-Cortez seeks to achieve through Medicare for All.

Pence has held two meetings with congressional officials in the past week. On Sunday, a Democratic official told Fox News that Republicans were to blame for the meeting starting 45 minutes late and for failing to provide a full budget justification for their $5.7 billion request for wall funding. Trump, however, called the meeting productive, and a House GOP leadership aide told Fox News that Democrats had received an exhaustive cost breakdown as requested.
According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, wage growth among low-wage workers has recently outpaced that of high-wage workers. Pay for the bottom quarter of wage earners, for example, rose 4.5 percent in November, compared with 2.9 percent for the highest 25 percent of earners. The data also showed that wage growth during the period among low-skilled workers grew at the same pace as that of high-skill workers.

Good morning and welcome to Fox News First. Here's what you need to know as you start your day ...

We know that Americans overwhelmingly favor common ground limits on abortion. In 2019 alone, state lawmakers emboldened by President Trump enacted nearly 60 strong new pro-life laws, such as bans on discrimination abortions for Down syndrome. It is time our court system unshackles the people and respects representative democracy. Today's legal landscape is more favorable than ever to aggressively challenging Roe, with some promising cases working through the lower courts and more on the way.

Does that hurt the credibility of the Democrats in Congress in the House that before they even knew whether this was true -- yes, they did say if it's true, but, man, we're already talking about impeachment and resignation.
But even in the wake of Trump's pressure-packed call to Georgia's Republican secretary of state, wouldn't that amount to an admission of guilt for a president who loudly proclaims he has done nothing wrong? And it wouldn't affect the New York investigations already under way.
PENCE: -- border security or the wall. So, what we want to do is go into the legislative process.
Presidential candidates from neighboring Massachusetts have a history of winning the first-in-the-nation primary. Think Michael Dukakis in 1988, Paul Tsongas in 1992, John Kerry in 2004, and Mitt Romney in 2012.

It really feels like we're at the center of the political universe and will be until Jan. 5, Maria Saporta, the chair of the Atlanta Press Club Debate Committee, told Fox News before the debate between Loeffler and Warnock in early December.
From the day he was inaugurated, President Trump set out to make our country better off than it was before.
So I think there's a -- kind of a decided lack of enthusiasm, but it's going to go -- it's going to happen. It's going to move forward.

The midterm elections last November saw Democrats easily take control of not only California's governor's mansion, but also its state legislature with the party now holding a veto-proof majority in both houses.
Internalizing all this will not be easy for Republican leaders. They'll have to unlearn decades of bumper sticker-talking points and corporate propaganda. They'll likely lose donors in the process.

The first episode of 2019 opened with Mike arriving at Ryan's pot store in order to give him some tax papers and handle a few of his more clerical things.

But with Democrats assuming the House majority earlier this month, and with it the power to investigate and subpoena witnesses, the Kavanaugh controversy has largely taken a backseat to other Trump-related issues like his tax returns and alleged Russia connections.

Rural Fire Service officials said they had located the plane, a C-130 Hercules, that crashed in the snowy Monaro region of New South Wales state.

TRUMP: So, when I came in as you know NATO was virtually a dead organization. It had no money. Nobody was paying except us. Practically nobody was paying. If you look at a chart of money and funds received, it looked like a rollercoaster down. Now, and Secretary Stoltenberg, I think he's terrific. In my first year, I raised $130 billion from them, not from us. And now he just announced $530 billion, all because of me. He's my biggest salesman. My greatest salesman Secretary Stoltenberg.

For decades, the Democratic Party has been steadily moving away from its roots as America's self-proclaimed champion of the middle class, instead choosing to embrace radical identity politics and a socialist agenda.

TRUMP: If he fought really hard against President Obama, like he does against me, he would have won the election. Does that make sense to you?
JORDAN: Yes. No, I mean, look, they never expected him to do this. One of the great moves the president made is actually release the call transcript. The transcript itself shows no quid pro quo. The two individuals on the call, President Trump and President Zelensky, have repeatedly said there was no pressure, no pushing, no linkage of any type of investigation to the security assistance dollars. Third point, there Ukrainians didn't even know at the time of the call that the aid was on hold, that the aid have been paused. They didn't learn until about a month later from the Politico article. And the most important fact -- and this is one that the Democrats can never get past -- the most important fact is, the Ukrainians took no action, i.e., no announcement, no promise to start, no investigation, no announcement whatsoever about doing an investigation into the Bidens or Burisma to get the aid released. The aid was released because, over that pause time, that 55 days when the aid was paused, the president became convinced that Zelensky was a genuine reformer, and he decided to go ahead and release the hard-earned tax dollars of the American people to Ukraine.

Ocasio-Cortez is not alone. The Democratic Party in the House chose to begin 2019 demanding higher taxes. They have already voted down an amendment offered by Republican Ways and Means ranking member Kevin Brady to make the standard deduction and child tax credit permanent (Now they expire in ten years like the Bush tax cuts of 2001.)
No three strikes and out for me, said the Republican.
One of the bills the president brags about the most is the VA Accountability Bill. That was my bill that I've been working on. And, fortunately, when he was elected, we were able to get it done. The child tax credit that we got expanded. The PPP program that saved tens of millions of jobs across the country. So I'm looking forward to being able to tell the people of Florida, and in the meantime I have two years left to continue to do my job.
So if you could sum up -- I assume you agree that this is a grave concern. The C.D.C., I think confirmed that today. What's the response to it?
In the aftermath of a bitter impeachment battle, we will finally see accountability for misconduct within the DOJ and the FBI. Will we? We will talk with Congressman Devin Nunes and Congressman Doug Collins, along with Senator Tim Scott, coming up.

Furthermore, early reports are predicting more record turnout in 2020 with encouraging headlines such as, Expect Record Turnout in 2020.

The GOP's 53-member majority can weather several defections in the Senate, and Trump has threatened to use his veto power to defeat any legislation to reopen the government without wall funding. But the indications on Wednesday that some Republicans are increasingly wary of the shutdown, which Trump has said could last for years, highlighted the potential political pitfalls of leaving hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed or without pay.

And, it has been said in recent days that Democrats are increasingly looking to budget reconciliation to potentially pass the next COVID package.
And that's why we shouldn't move forward with this trial that is beyond our constitutional authority.
CRUZ: Well, starting with the second part first, I do think what we have seen coming out of the House is an abuse of the Constitution. And the reason is that they're using this for political purposes. This is the first time in history any president is alleged -- has been impeached without the articles alleging any criminal conduct at all, without alleging any federal crime was violated. They don't allege any federal law was violated. They don't even allege as much as that the president has a speeding ticket, and that has never happened in our country's history. And to use impeachment, like the House Democrats are doing, to express their political disagreement with the president, to try to overturn an election they're unhappy with, that is an abuse of the Constitution. Now, the first question you asked about process and witnesses, let me tell you what we can -- what we can expect to see in the next week or two going forward. On Tuesday, when we come back, the Senate will convene at 1:00 p.m. And we will start with pretrial motions. We will start with probably battling motions. What I expect the Senate to do is adopt a scheduling order laying out the next couple of weeks. That scheduling order is modeled after the scheduling order for the Bill Clinton impeachment. It's very, very similar. So it provides that we start with the House managers getting 24 hours spread over two days to present their case. They can argue evidence.

Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock want to go to Washington to erase everything President Trump has done for our country. The first vote they will cast is to make Democrat Chuck Schumer the next Senate Majority Leader.

But the echoes go beyond the big picture. Look at what Warren said about Washington's corruption when she spoke in Iowa last week.
French officials said members of the yellow vest protest movement vandalized or destroyed more than half of the country's speed camera network, which were seen by some as a cynical revenue-generating measure aimed at the middle and lower classes.

TRUMP: I'm not a fan of Google. I'm a fan of great companies, OK.
EDWARDS: No, I mean, it -- this was not an offer in compromise. Let's look at it. It was funding for a wall that Democrats and the majority of the American people oppose. It was temporary reprisal and temporary protective status and -- for the -- for the dreamers, something that the president took away. And so you don't give back something that you took away and -- and say that that is an offer in compromise.

The White House's claims on the terror threat at the border have emerged as a major point of contention in recent days. Speaking to Fox News Sunday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders remarked that nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border.

Trump expanded the definition of the deserving poor to include everyday working families whose wages had stagnated for years. Democrats have long used similar arguments to enact universal social welfare programs.

And we're back now with the panel.
You'll have plenty of time to think about what happened on Tuesday come Wednesday morning when Democrats are in charge and there's nothing you can do about it, now or ever. On Monday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., came out in favor of D.C. statehood. That's plainly unconstitutional, but that's not the point. The point is two more Democrats in the United States Senate, probably four if you include Puerto Rico. That's a permanent new majority. That means you have what's called a one-party state, and that means the game is over. That's coming at high speed. Just be sure not to think about it.
PELOSI: We recognize on the Democratic side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government. And we made that very clear to the president.

In the House, Democrats have kept the government shut down rather than fund the sort of border barriers they consistently supported before President Trump's election. In the Senate, Democrats made a disgusting spectacle out of the confirmation process for Justice Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump's eminently well-qualified pick to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, even though it jeopardized vulnerable red-state Democrats heading into the 2018 midterm elections.

Conversely, a January 15 roster of 605 Administration accomplishments says that Trump let pharmacists recommend lowest-cost options, ended the costly kickbacks to middlemen (cutting brand-name treatments up to 30 percent), and excised healthcare regulations, which lowered drug prices for the first time in 51 years.

Although the Green New Deal has received huge amounts of media attention in recent weeks – both positive and negative – the radical origins of the plan have not. Ocasio-Cortez has been labeled an innovative thinker for offering the allegedly visionary Green New Deal, but the truth is that most of these ideas have been floating around socialist circles since at least the early 2000s, and there is strong evidence to suggest that much of the draft text of Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal is merely a revised version of the Leap Manifesto, a socialist green-energy plan pushed by far-left environmentalists in Canada.

By contrast, President Obama is bestowing a wholesale, blanket amnesty for an entire class of nearly 5 million people. He is doing so not for the reasons allowed by law, but for purposes that appear to be purely political. This is a flagrant abuse of prosecutorial discretion.

While we are surely at or very near full employment, as of November (the most recent month for which we have the data) there were still about 1 million more job openings than people unemployed. This is strong evidence that the competition for employees that has been driving wage growth will continue. With more people employed at higher wages and taking home more of what they earn (thanks to the Republican tax cuts), consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of our economic growth, should remain strong.

A new president will be tested in many ways, so he will need all the goodwill he can muster from Americans of all stripes. Allowing Trump's tenure to reach its natural conclusion should be one of Biden's easiest decisions.
Ocasio-Cortez's commitment to socialism isn't limited to energy and environment-related issues, either. She has also called for the passage of Medicare for All, legislation proposed by socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., that would put the government in charge of the entire health care industry—at a cost of $32 trillion, according to estimates from the Mercatus Center. And she has proposed creating multiple other trillion-dollar government programs, like a federal jobs guarantee that would pay anyone who wants a government job a living wage and other basic income programs, which are designed to pay lower-income and non-working people money, even if they are able-bodied and could work.

Now, situations like that are complex domestic situations, as the police call them, and we don't pretend to know the whole story or have all of the context. We do believe that in a democracy, when someone is running for the United States Senate in a race that could tip the balance completely in favor of one party that will then control the entire U.S. government, you probably ought to know that and the candidate ought to answer questions about it. It is domestic abuse that's being alleged, after all.

And we are now scaling up both our surveillance of these and our study of these in cross-agency collaborations with the NIH, with the Department of Defense, with the FDA, with the CDC so that we can monitor these variants, as well as monitor how the impact of these variants on vaccines, as well as on our therapeutics. And you're absolutely right, what this tells us is that we need to get more vaccine out there and that people really, when they have -- are offered the vaccine, have the opportunity to roll up their sleeves and take it. WALLACE: But -- but is that fair to call it a race against time? To -- to make sure that -- that you vaccinate people before we get a strain that the vaccine won't work on? WALENSKY: I would say we've been in a race all along. The more virus that is out there, the more virus that is replicating, the more likely that we are going to have mutations and variants. So not only do we need to vaccinate, but we need for people to wear masks, we need all of these other mitigation strategies so that we can decrease the amount of virus that is circulating and, therefore, decrease the amount of variants that are out there.

BARTIROMO: And now this from this past week.
Folks, know your legislative history better, Rosen scolded her critics. #McConnell ended the filibuster for one of the most important votes Senators take, namely a Supreme Court nomination. And if he needed it for legislation - if he ever wanted to actually pass anything but tax cuts - he'd do it again.
that was working for them, the answer would be, no. And that's a big part
Now, I don't propose, I'm not serious about this. I don't think Bernie Sanders should be impeached.
Donalds said his humble upbringing in New York City is the best preparation for the halls of Congress.
But whereas the left's policy blueprint is one of division, censorship, political correctness, hypocrisy, wokeness and disdain for our Judeo-Christian heritage, the Republican Party is emerging as an increasingly diverse, patriotic, pro-worker party committed to equality of opportunity.
Of course, that is not the only tactic Democrats might use to expand their grip on the country. Other ambitions include stacking the Supreme Court, welcoming reliably blue Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., as states, and abolishing the Electoral College. These attempts to profoundly change our nation could only succeed if the Democrats win control of the Senate.
In his testimony scheduled for Feb. 7, Cohen will swear an oath to tell the truth. But he previously swore – falsely and repeatedly – that the tax returns he submitted to the IRS were true and accurate.
Many wrongfully accused parents were plunged into debt when tax officials demanded payments be returned. The government has in the past apologized for the tax office's methods and in March earmarked 500 million euros ($607 million) to compensate more than 20,000 parents.
House Democratic leaders this week passed over New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, and other new progressive firebrands for memberships on powerful committees, despite a viral campaign by liberal activists.

The U.S. budget deficit through the first three months of this budget year is up 11.8 percent from the same period a year ago, putting the country on track to record its first $1 trillion deficit in eight years.
The president's executive action to legalize illegals by nullifying existing law, constitutes a stunning abuse of office: usurping the power of Congress, while abdicating his duty to uphold and enforce the laws. Here are three ways this is happening:
The citizenship question represents the third time since October that Francisco is seeking the court's intervention without an appellate ruling. The other two involved Obama-era programs to shield young immigrants from deportation and allow transgender people to serve in the military.
So let me see if I understand this -- an American mother shows a picture of a child murdered by an illegal immigrant and Chuck Schumer and his gang they come out and show pictures of federal employees - is there a moral equivalency there? Are you kidding? Are you working for Americans here or illegal immigrants?
This is the man running the World Health Organization at the beginnings of a global epidemic.
Over the past year, nominal wages for the lowest 10 percent of American workers jumped 7 percent. The growth rate for those without a high-school diploma was 9 percent, they wrote.

In turn, the race has heightened divisiveness and polarization in our national politics, as the two possible outcomes will yield drastically different results for the new Congress and the incoming president.
What's remarkable is how the rest of us responded to it. We didn't question why Sandberg was saying this. We didn't laugh in her face at the pure absurdity of it. Our corporate media celebrated Sandberg as the leader of a liberation movement. Her book became a bestseller: Lean In. As if putting a corporation first is empowerment. It is not. It is bondage.

The new Speaker of the House has announced that the Democratic Congress will never, under any circumstances, allocate a single tax dollar to build the border wall, not because it's too expensive, obviously, these are the Democrats, but because a wall would violate some previously unknown and never-explained moral code.

At the end of the 19th century, the Supreme Court declared that Congress had plenary power (meaning full and complete) to regulate immigration. Derived from Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, the doctrine is based on the concept that immigration is a question of national sovereignty, relating to a nation's right to define its own borders and restrict entrance therein. As the high court observed, Over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete.

The first is, this has started big. You know, 30 executive orders in two and a half days, I mean that's not -- that's not sleepy Joe Biden. And you're going to see more of the same this week, by the way, more executive orders, more on coronavirus, maybe more in immigration. So this is an attempt to have a very fast start.
The Nevada caucuses will mark the first appearance of Bloomberg's name on a primary ballot – after the former mayor of New York City opted to skip the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses and Feb. 10 New Hampshire primary -- two contests that Sanders won, placing him at the head of the Democratic field, which includes former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg.
JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's a good question. Number one, Iowa is a Democratic caucus. Have you ever been to a caucus? No, you haven't.
PENCE: Chris, first and foremost, our hearts go out to the families of those four American heroes and we are praying especially for them yesterday as there remains returned to Dover Air Force Base in presence of the president of the United States.
Yeah, I guess so, Ocasio-Cortez laughed, adding that she's a Democratic socialist.
Michael Bloomberg, meanwhile, still getting slammed from all sides. Democrats pounding the money he is making, while President Trump is just pounding.
A year ago at this time, the biggest story in the world was getting almost no attention in our country.
As the largest non-government health care provider in the world, the Catholic Church stands ready to work with him and his administration to promote global women's health in a manner that furthers integral human development, safeguarding innate human rights and the dignity of every human life, beginning in the womb, the statement added. To serve our brothers and sisters with respect, it is imperative that care begin with ensuring that the unborn are free from violence, recognizing every person as a child of God. We hope the new administration will work with us to meet these significant needs.
Also this morning, the death toll from the coronavirus is on the rise. The Department of Homeland Security's acting secretary, Chad Wolf, is here live to tell us how the department is moving to keeping America safe, plus his take on why New York is fighting the department over changes to the Global Entry program.
The reason that they give behind this is what's most troubling to me. So they argue that by treating HIV as a negative by criminalizing HIV, that you're stigmatizing people who are living with HIV. That's a ludicrous argument.

Policies and appointments are only a part of a presidency. A president must also unite us, inspire us, and defend our vital institutions, Romney tweeted on Jan. 1, along with a link to the article. In the piece, he critiqued the recent flurry of departures from the White House, most recently Defense Secretary James Mattis.
That will open up the East Side all the way up to Harlem for exciting new possibilities, Cuomo said.
They seem to have hit dead ends with Roger Stone, Paul Manafort and General Michael Flynn. They can write a report condemning the president but the Russian collusion goods don't seem to exist. They may just keep on going, picking up new investigations from the Democratic House committees, and act as a permanent presidential investigation unit. But eventually I think the Supreme Court, which will start to get cases that could limit their power and authority, and the appointment of an unrecused attorney general, will catch up to them if they don't end it soon. Expect their report by March 15, 2019.
The study is the latest evidence of a party that is swinging to the left, adopting positions in its mainstream that were once on the fringes of party debate -- particularly on health care, economics and immigration.

INGRAHAM: What a week of shows. We had the breaking news on the missile strike on Tuesday. Then we had the secretary of state with us last night. And the president joining us for another exclusive tonight. And I'm telling you, the news shows no signs of slowing down next week because we expect the articles of impeachment to hit the Senate Tuesday or maybe Wednesday. And as always, we hope you join us right here for all of the breaking news, and the best analysis, and a little humor, you need that, too. So that's it from us tonight in Washington.

The president directed me to produce what we're calling tax cuts 2.0, Kudlow said. It will be published some time during the campaign, as a message for future Trump economic growth policies, particular emphasis on the middle class, in his second term. . . We are looking at a variety of tax cuts, sometimes making permanent some existing tax cuts, some existing corporate tax cuts.

McKibben's article is riddled with World War II comparisons.

Without the same urgency and foresight displayed by FDR—without immediate executive action—we will lose this war.
Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., tried to get Dillingham to weigh in, saying that citizens in Montana should have more of a say in Washington, D.C., than illegal immigrants harboring in sanctuary cities across the country. But the nominee responded: I have no plans to voice an opinion on that question.

The legislative process is a negotiation and up to this point, literally for the last month while the president and I have stayed here in Washington and been engaging continuously with Democrat leadership, and with rank-and-file members in the House and Senate, what we heard again and again is we will not negotiate until the president reopens the government.

To begin with the obvious: Nancy Pelosi does not speak for the Catholic Church. She speaks as a high-level important government leader, and as a private citizen,' Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone said in a statement. And on the question of the equal dignity of human life in the womb, she also speaks in direct contradiction to a fundamental human right that Catholic teaching has consistently championed for 2,000 years.

President Obama's decision that existing laws shall not be enforced against some 5 million illegal immigrants violates his sworn constitutional duty. Article II, Section 3 requires that the President shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. Nowhere is it written that the chief executive is granted the latitude to pick and choose which laws he wants to enforce. He cannot ignore or nullify laws he does not like because the constitution gives him no power not to execute laws. To infer such latitude would invite an authoritarian rule anathema to our founding fathers' vision. President Obama admitted as much when he said, The fact of the matter is, there are laws on the books that I have to enforce. He was specifically talking about immigration laws.

There has also been talk of proposing payroll tax cuts, Congressional sources tell FOX Business.

Federal workers on Friday are slated to miss their second full paycheck of the shutdown, which is now the longest in the nation's history.

Social conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, and yet reach a strikingly similar conclusion. The real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the American family is collapsing. Nothing can be fixed before we fix that. Yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. The idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. They refuse to consider it. Questioning markets feels like apostasy.

Fox News: With President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration just one week away, his transition team is pressing the Senate to confirm his national security nominees ahead of the event, saying the country's security is 'at stake.' After Democrats were victorious in the Georgia Senate runoff elections earlier this month, the Biden team is making a heavy push for secretary of state nominee Anthony Blinken, homeland security secretary nominee Alejandro Mayorkas, director of national intelligence nominee Avril Haines and defense secretary nominee retired Gen. Lloyd Austin. 'Regardless of any developments, with our national security at stake, the pandemic costing thousands of lives every day, and our economy in a historic recession, there is absolutely no justification for Republicans to jeopardize the ability of the United States government to keep the American people safe, distribute vaccines, and put Americans back to work,' Biden transition spokesman Andrew Bates told Fox News.

It's the news media that's been carrying the Democrats' water, he said. They're the ones who've listened to the false reports of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign...

Currently, the coronavirus appears to kill about two percent of the people who have it. So let's be generous for a moment and imagine that asymptomatic carriers are not detected and the real death rate is only say half a percent that would be one quarter of the current estimates.

This is the movement that has, so far, stopped the government health care debacle from passing; there's no one else standing in the way. Democrats have the 60 votes they need.

The setting for the rally was atypical for Trump: a Jersey Shore city where people camped out overnight on the beach to get a spot in line for the rally being held at a boardwalk convention center.

While high-profile attorney Michael Avenatti – who flirted with a Democratic nomination run last year before deciding against a White House bid – called for fighting fire with fire, most of the potential Democratic contenders are avoiding a slugfest with Trump.

In January, Congress passed the US-Mexico-Canada-Agreement (USMCA). According to a study by the United States International Trade Commission, the USMCA will increase GDP by $68.2 billion and employment by 176,000 jobs.

The largest gains in output, exports, wages, and employment would be in the manufacturing sector.

TRUMP: Well, I don't think so, but we will tell you that probably it was going to be the embassy in Baghdad. You saw that happening. You saw with all of the men, very few women circling it and circling it very strongly and very viciously, knocking out windows and trying to get in and they were close to getting in and I called out the military. They said, we'll have it there tomorrow. I said, no, you'll have it there today. We're not going to have another Benghazi on our hands. And we did a really amazing job, get no credit for it, but we never get credit for anything and that's OK. In the meantime, we have the greatest economy we've ever had, a lot of other things. But I think you would have had another Benghazi had we not acted quickly. That could have been stopped. And this was stopped. And we had our Apaches going there, the great helicopters and they were dropping flares all over the place and a lot of things were happening. They had action real fast and everybody disappeared.

To their credit, Big Tech companies largely fended off calls from the left to take even more draconian steps to silence their political opponents — some more than others.

Declaring the opioid crisis a public health emergency, the president secured $6 billion in funding to fight the epidemic.

Trump also hit Democrats for largely opposing restrictions on even late-term abortion, saying, every child is a sacred gift from God. Trump recently became the first president to speak at the pro-life March for Life rally in Washington.
WALLACE (on camera): And hello again from FOX News in Washington.
Most Democrats identify as liberals for the first time, according to an analysis released Tuesday -- marking the latest sign of a leftward shift of the Democratic Party as it lurches to the fringes on issues such as Medicare-for-all, amnesty for illegal immigrants and a Green New Deal.

Meanwhile, the effects are the partial government shutdown are beginning to manifest. Trump is expected to sign legislation this week authorizing back pay for 800,000 federal workers who either have been idled or are working without pay during the shutdown. He is expected to address the American Farm Bureau on Monday. Farmers have supported Trump through a trade war with China, but some are complaining about the loss of loans, payments and other agricultural services because of the shutdown.
There was truth in this. But it wasn't the whole story. How do we know? Because virtually the same thing has happened decades later to an entirely different population. In many ways, rural America now looks a lot like Detroit.
Facebook and Twitter drew a bright and dangerous line in the online sand late this week by banning the sitting president of the United States from their platforms.
Unemployment fell under Trump, but it was already falling at a rapid pace before he came to office:

Well, I think health care is becoming that economic issue, because what voters really care about is for their costs to go down in health care. I thought it was very fascinating this week, when Bernie Sanders went around touting his Medicare for all plan, that even the Culinary Union said they weren't going to endorse him and even said, we like our health care, and we don't want you to take it away.

GABBARD: This is -- this is part of the problem. And this was post-2016 where a lot of people saw the problems with this system, with the superdelegates, with how hard it was for people to actually get out and cast their votes, to get their voices heard, that's driven a lot of the frustration that I'm hearing from Democrats with this process today.
Yay! The Democrat zombies are all standing. They're applauding, standing ovation. But they're unconcerned with the real world effects of some of those policies, namely this rise in the minimum wage.

Despite the reported efforts in 2014 and 2015, Trump did not do well in either poll, according to the Wall Street Journal. Trump did not make it into the top 100 candidates of top business leaders, and Trump ranked in fifth place, or 5 percent, of the Drudge Report poll. Online polls, unlike scientific ones conducted by pollsters, are notoriously unreliable.

In 1996, Congress passed a law which requires federal immigration agents to deport illegal immigrants, with few exceptions. The statutory language is mandatory. Thus, whatever prosecutorial discretion which may have existed previously, was specifically eliminated by that legislative act. Yet, the President is now, in effect, ordering those agents to break the law. He cannot, on his own, engage in a de facto repeal of this law by executive action. To do so would be, quite simply, lawlessness and a dereliction of his duty.
A New York Times analysis found that one-third of Senate Democrats and more than half of House Democrats have endorsed Medicare-for-all proposals -- including a number of possible 2020 presidential hopefuls.

CRUZ: Well, Maria, you're right. And the Democrats desperately want to keep that topic off the news. And, sadly, an awful lot of folks in the media are very compliant with that. But that's why I said this week the president having the opportunity to defend himself is so important, because I think one of the fundamental defenses that I expect to hear from the White House this week is that the president has inherent authority and, in fact, a responsibility to investigate corruption. And when you look at what happened with Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, there is, at a minimum, prima facie evidence of corruption. You have got Hunter Biden getting paid $83,000 a month by Burisma, the largest natural gas company in Ukraine; $83,000 a month is a million dollars a year.

In Congress, Steel will have to overcome strong GOP opposition if she wants to repeal the cap on state and local tax deductions. Up until Trump's tax bill, taxpayers could deduct the full amount of their state and local tax bills on their federal taxes. The deduction really helped residents in high-tax states like California and New York.
These are major policy changes, and I criticized Republicans for using reconciliation to give tax breaks to billions to create a situation where large profitable corporations now pay zero in federal income taxes. Yes, I did criticize them for that, Sanders said. And if they want to criticize me for helping to feed children who are hungry – or senior citizens who are isolated and alone and don't have enough food, they can criticize me. I think it's the appropriate step forward.
And I'm back with Congressman Devin Nunes, who sent a letter to I.G. Michael Atkinson asking for information about the whistle-blower and how the I.G.'s office handled the whistle-blower in the impeachment.

While these sentiments are fueled in part by anger and anguish over the siege of the Capitol by thousands of pro-Trump rioters, they also reflect a last-minute scramble to salvage personal reputations by scrambling off a sinking ship.

Polling has shown over time, that voters tend to support some, but not all, restrictions on abortion. In May, for example, Gallup found that 50 percent of voters thought abortion should be legal only under certain circumstances, as opposed to any circumstances (29 percent) or none (20 percent). That reflected Gallup's historical data as well. And while a plurality say abortion is immoral, moderates (55 percent) tend to identify as pro-choice.
Some Democrats are taking their radical agenda to the extreme and proposing things like a 70 percent income tax rate on the wealthiest Americans. Does anyone really believe our historically greedy government will stop there? Eventually that 70 percent rate will trickle down to the middle class.

That's pushing it, although there could be tax and budget issues for new citizens. Statehood for DC?

Poor student, poor everything and then she comes, and she talks about the Green New Deal and all these poor fools say, isn't it wonderful, isn't it wonderful.

And so, this way, we don't have to spend a lot of time talking about the jobs gains and everything else going on in the Trump economy. They're noteworthy. They're hard to argue again. So we're going to focus on this stuff, and maybe do better.
All this, and to borrow a phrase from the President, the best is yet to come!
HANNITY: It's good to see you, Congresswoman.
In terms of the rules, I think the president is entitled to due process. I think he's entitled to have a defense. I think he's entitled to present, you know, testimony and evidence if necessary and, you know, the House doesn't have much of a record of witnesses and so forth because they, frankly, rammed it through very quickly. So, I think, obviously, fairness is important no matter who it is we're talking about.

And if this is such an important priority for the president, why didn't he do it at the beginning of the administration? He waited to the lame duck. Why?

His foundation was closed on for persistent illegalities. The gentleman heading the ISIS effort resigned.

I think we shouldn't legitimize this (impeachment), Graham said. These actions, if they continue, will incite more violence.

Now, how has he been met – I think by outrageous conduct by the Congress itself….To the American people, what good is going to come from impeaching President Trump when he's out of office?
KURTZ: And the president is not stopping the tweets about the Stone case.
That corruption is why those nine Georgia hospitals were allowed to close while politicians like Perdue have handed out our tax dollars to elite donors.

The Republican Party must resist violence in all forms, denounce White supremacy and continue to grow in Black and Hispanic communities.
So now here we go again with a second kick of the mule. Actually, it is the third, fourth or fifth kick. Trump and Congress have already approved nearly $3 trillion on pandemic spending. The Biden proposal would bring the total spending for the pandemic to about $5 trillion.

Under his presidency, the government saddled us all with a three-sizes-fits-all version of compulsory health care (which caused more than five million persons to lose their coverage and their doctors); it has been spying on all Americans all the time (and we sleepily permit it to do so); it allowed our ambassador in Libya to be murdered (after it destroyed the lawful government there); it told illegal aliens they need not worry about deportation (and thus encouraged the immigration of hundreds of thousands more -- even unaccompanied children -- to our shores); it neglected veterans to the point of death in government hospitals (demonstrating conclusively that the feds cannot deliver health care); it released assets material to terrorist organizations into the theater of war in the Middle East (ostensibly in a prisoner swap to save a weird military bird who once embraced his captors); it has claimed the power to kill Americans it views as a threat to others and yet too troublesome to arrest and bring to trial (all the while claiming it has a secret reading of the Constitution and American law that somehow justifies this); and it has added $6 trillion to government debt (with no plans to repay it).

If Republicans win even one of the Georgia races, they'll hold a Senate majority for the next two years and have an effective veto over President-elect Joe Biden's agenda. If Democrats sweep both races, however, the Senate will be at an effective 50-50 tie on party lines. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would then be able to break ties on party-line votes.
President Biden's first 100 days are sure to look different than those of Democrats past, and not just due to the unprecedented challenge of a pandemic. Economic challenge was met by greater spending under Barack Obama than by his Democratic predecessor, Bill Clinton, and even more federal largesse will be doled out by Biden if Congress gives him his way. Other priorities have differed too.

WILL BOTH SIDES RETURN TO THE BARGAINING TABLE? - Congress is set to return Monday for its first full week of work since Democrats assumed control of the House and neither President Trump nor Democratic lawmakers show signs of relenting in the battle over the border wall at the center of the partial government shutdown ... In an interview with FOX News Sunday host Chris Wallace, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., recommended that President Trump open the government for a period of time - perhaps three weeks - while resuming negotiations and trying to reach a deal with Democrats. If Democrats still refuse to compromise on a deal after three weeks, Graham said, Trump should resort to emergency options to get funding for the border wall.
That's not surprising. Romney spent the bulk of his business career at a firm called Bain Capital. Bain Capital all but invented what is now a familiar business strategy: Take over an existing company for a short period of time, cut costs by firing employees, run up the debt, extract the wealth, and move on, sometimes leaving retirees without their earned pensions. Romney became fantastically rich doing this.

The reason she prefers to use a marginal tax rate as a talking point is because she believes it wouldn't affect the overwhelming majority of Americans and that she can get public support for it.

Speaking Monday at the American Farm Bureau Convention, Trump said his administration is digging the United States out of unfair trade deals, noting the recent accord on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement—still pending congressional approval—and continued negotiations with China.

In a statement, Cohen said he accepted the invitation to appear from Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the committee's chairman, [i]n furtherance of my commitment to cooperate and provide the American people with answers. Cummings said the committee was in the process of consulting with Special Counsel [Robert] Mueller's office to ensure that Cohen's scheduled testimony would not interfere with the ongoing investigation into interactions between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.

MO ELLEITHEE, CONTRIBUTOR: I don't think so. I think most Americans would agree that this is the president's shutdown and that the president is basically holding hundreds of thousands of federal workers hostage over -- over this. And it's not just them. It's the people who contract with the federal government, people who aren't getting paid, people who are worried about paying the bills, people who are worried about paying their rent, people who may get stuck at airports.

Going forward, no individual or group is safe. As a spokesperson for the American Civil Liberties Union — no bastion of conservatism — noted in a statement: We understand the desire to permanently suspend him [Trump] now, but it should concern everyone when companies like Facebook and Twitter wield the unchecked power to remove people from platforms that have become indispensable for the speech of billions — especially when political realities make those decisions easier.
Not just life, but I mean, we're not even talking about abortion right now. We couldn't in the last Congress even get a vote on the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act. So that's not really abortion. You have every definition, completely separated from the mother now, a human being baby. And they're debating about whether to help that baby and provide care.
CICILLINE: Look -- I'm not going to -- look, it's kind of odd to hear people on the Republican side who have not condemned the president's language in a million of different contexts to suddenly be clutching their pearls over her use of that language. Like, look, this is a private event, she can use whatever language she thinks is appropriate.

Pence said Monday that he provided Democratic Sens. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Chuck Schumer of New York with a written offer to end the shutdown, but it was refused. The vice president did not confirm that he had asked for $2.5 billion for the wall -- which would represent a significant concession from the administration's previously stated goal of more than $5 billion -- but smiled when asked if that was, in fact, the number.

Additionally, Newsom announced he would sign an executive order dramatically expanding the state's Department of Health Care Services authority to negotiate drug prices, in the hopes of lowering prescription drug costs.
Pence insider says 25th Amendment decision not about defending Trump - Fox News: After breaking with his boss last week and certifying President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College victory over President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence this week quickly shot down a push by House Democrats urging him to invoke the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to remove Trump from the presidency. A veteran Republican consultant who's close to the Trump orbit tells Fox News that the decision by the vice president was less of a move to defend the president but rather of Pence doing 'what's right.' … Just as Pence last week resisted the president's repeated calls to upend the election results by refusing to accept the Electoral College results in a handful of states where Biden narrowly edged Trump, he also rejected the move by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and congressional Democrats to remove the president from office just a week before the end of his term by invoking the 25th Amendment. Pence said invoking the 25th Amendment is not 'in the best interest of our Nation or consistent with the Constitution.'

JORDAN: Yes. And one of them even -- one of the FBI agents even said they didn't think he was lying at the time. But they later then said that he -- that he did. Yes, they tried to set him up. They did set him up. But this is not unusual, because -- well, it should be unusual, but the FBI did it another time as well. They did it on January 6 at Trump Tower, when it was president-elect Trump. They went up there and briefed president-elect Trump on the dossier, the dossier they already knew was false. They went and briefed the president on it, so they could go then leak it to the press, and the press could write about it. And they tried to set up the president-elect of the United States in the same manner. So this is how they operate. And they got caught. Think about what Mr. Horowitz told us last month, Maria. He told us that the FBI, when they went to get the Carter Page warrant to spy on the Trump campaign, they lied to the court 17 times in the initial application and the three renewals; 17 times, they lied to the court. And now what's interesting, is Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, the two individuals who were in charge of that investigation, got in a little spat now with Rod Rosenstein, who was also involved.

The poll came just as Democrats are pressuring the Biden administration to fulfill the president's campaign pledge to repeal the Hyde Amendment, which blocks most federal tax money from paying for abortions. Meanwhile, the administration has also committed to repealing the Mexico City Policy, which blocks funding for overseas organizations that perform abortions or provide information on the procedure.
What's interesting here for Republicans who say Democrats are just wasting their time, they hope to succeed on issues like health care, which galvanize their takeover of the House in the midterms. They think it can repeat here.
There was a criticism of that five years ago. The Associated Press get a report just in 2017 and found that it was happening again, and Dr. Tedros, his primary goal, socialized healthcare all over the world. That's his goal.
While the World Health Organization (WHO) is conducting its own investigation, the Trump administration and Republicans had expressed skepticism about the probe and the WHO itself.

Not only would putting the government in charge of health care cost trillions of dollars, but it would also force Americans to endure many of the same problems plaguing government-run health care models around the world, including long wait times for patients and rationing of care. The Fraser Institute reports that patients in Canada, which has a single-payer health care model, who require medically necessary elective orthopedic surgery wait on average 41.7 weeks – about 10 months – before receiving treatment. Patients requiring elective neurosurgery, including many patients who have brain tumors, wait 32.9 weeks.

When COVID-19 slammed the brakes on the U.S. economy last year, Congress took historic action to send out stimulus checks, boost federal unemployment insurance payments, replenish the financial lifeline to small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), bolster nutrition programs and lost revenue for family farmers, assist student borrowers, enact a temporary eviction moratorium, and help health care providers on the front lines of the pandemic.
None of it worked. Donald Trump was able to hoist his detractors by their own petards, turning their attacks into publicity, and their smears into affirmations of his authenticity.

Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), the largest socialist organization in the United States. DSA doesn't merely want to create new government-run social programs, it desires, in the words of a member of DSA and the editor of the socialist magazine Jacobin, to in the long run … end capitalism. On its website, DSA blames, in part, the globalization of capital for racism, sexism, homophobia, and environmental degradation.

Democrats have also proposed a dramatic increase to America's corporate tax rate. Rep. Yarmouth has said he favors raising the corporate rate from 21 percent to 28 percent – a 33 percent increase. This would be one of the largest corporate tax hikes in recent history, and it would roll back much of the reduction to the corporate tax rate passed by Republicans and President Donald Trump as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
Two Democratic victories in Georgia would result in a Senate evenly split between 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans.

I'm in Dublin Ireland by the way but have traveled extensively in America. Mostly off the beaten track on visits around the deep South for music and then Route 66 over several weeks… I was traveling in America in September 2016 and what I saw then convinced me Trump was going to take the presidency. The decline in prosperity right across middle America was appalling to see, poverty, abandoned towns, hollowed out communities and lack of interest from government to help, combined with Trumps campaign, plus the arrogance of Clinton could only have one result. And that's where you are today. Your point about a lack of civic education is valid but I think the problem goes a little deeper. A lot of people we met were out and out Republicans but were also very isolated. They never traveled, in a lot of cases never got much beyond their own county. They had no idea of the outside world, except the military people. And for them the outside world was Iraq or Afghanistan. I'm not saying they were stupid, far from it, but they were very open to the kind of crap that Trump has peddled. As the saying goes, all politics is local. … I don't know what the long term answer is but both sides of the divide need to start being honest with people. Civics and education is all very fine but people need proper honest leadership and this hasn't happened for a long time.

Braun, Manchin try to stop Congress from getting paid during shutdowns - Indianapolis Star: In his first act as a U.S. senator, Indiana Republican Mike Braun is expected to introduce a bipartisan bill that would prevent members of Congress — including himself — from being paid during government shutdowns. Currently, lawmakers are still paid when they are unable to pass spending bills by the deadline, while most federal workers are not. The latest partial government shutdown is now in its third week, as Democrats and President Donald Trump continue to clash over border security on the country's southern border. Trump has requested $5 billion for a border wall. Braun's bill, co-authored by West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin, would also prohibit retroactive pay for lawmakers.

Ocasio-Cortez's commitment to enacting democratic socialism is evident in many of her policy proposals, especially her plan for a Green New Deal. According to a draft resolution produced by Ocasio-Cortez to create a House climate change committee, the Green New Deal would eliminate nearly all fossil fuels in the United States by 2030 and instead force consumers to buy 100 percent of their power from renewable energy sources like wind and solar, which cost as much as five times more than existing fossil-fuel-power generation, and to purchase electric cars.

So if they overshoot it, then we have vaccine on the shelf. If they undershoot it, we have these queues and queues of people, people whose appointments are canceled. And, either way, we have challenges. So the fact that we don't know today, five days into this administration, and weeks into planning, how much vaccine we have just gives you a sense of the challenges we've been left with. WALLACE: One sign of the crunch that you're facing, at least in the short term, is that CDC put out guidelines this weekend that under, quote, exceptional circumstances you say that it would be OK to -- to mix doses, to use one vaccine for the first dose and the other vaccine, Moderna and Pfizer, for the second dose. And you also said, under these exceptional circumstances, instead of the three to four weeks that are recommended, that -- that patients could take the two doses as far as six weeks, the first dose from the second dose. But -- but, Dr. Walensky, you don't have any trials, clinical trials, you don't have any science to back that up. WALENSKY: I want to be very crystal clear here, those are not the recommendations of the CDC. The CDC recommends that you follow the FDA authorization, 21 days for Pfizer, 28 days for Moderna, and you stick to the same one. But the CDC is a place that people come to for guidance.

Instead of jobs, health care or border security, the incoming Democrat majority in the House is making a so-called reform package their first legislative priority in the new Congress. The bill consists of speech-stifling regulations under the guise of campaign finance reform, voting reform that puts automatic voter registration ahead of election integrity, and the overtly political action of income tax return disclosure that applies to the president but not Congress. It should be noted that this effort has a zero percent chance of passing the Senate, much less being signed into law.

And it's interesting because Amy Klobuchar's strong debate in New Hampshire is credited with helping her finish a surprising third place in the first- in-the-nation New Hampshire primary, so she might have some things to say tonight about Bloomberg's campaign gurus saying that she should drop out -- Neil.
People in Washington do listen and this is something that is under- appreciated. If you email Senator McConnell and you call him, 30 GOP county chairs have sent a letter to him saying they don't think we should be for impeachment. I don't know how he will come down on this, but I know that this is a partisan thing and even the chief justice the Supreme Court doesn't think it's legitimate.
In my 12 years here, I don't think there's ever been a freshman on Approps, Ways and Means or Energy and Commerce, Kentucky Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth, who chairs the Budget committee, told Politico. Democratic Reps. Ed Case and Ann Kirkpatrick are expected to join Appropriations instead.

TRUMP: I think it cheapened the word impeachment. I think impeachment is a very ugly word, but I think this cheapen the word impeachment. I think Nancy Pelosi and Schiff, because he's corrupt. I mean he's the guy stands up at the United States Congress and repeats a conversation except it was a fraud. He made up a conversation. He was saying my conversation and it was totally wrong and he knew it. He said, don't call me, I'll call you. That's from the Godfather. That's a mafia statement. I never said that. He said eight times quid pro quo. It was no times. He made up a conversation and repeated it in front of Congress and because he has immunity, we can't do anything about it. I'd like to say, why did you do that? Now, these people are frauds and it's very bad. No, they've cheapened the word impeachment. It's a bad word to start off with. I really say, it's an ugly word. To me, it's a very ugly word, but maybe it played to our benefit.
Negotiations continued at the White House Friday. But apparently, they bore no fruit, because afterward, the president emerged to say the situation on our Southern border is so grave, he may be forced to build a wall without Congressional approval.

CRUZ: I think it is certainly possible that this trial could last one to two weeks. On the other hand, if the Senate makes decision to go down the road of additional witnesses, that could extend it six, eight weeks, or even longer. So I think there are really two paths here. But what you just noted there is important. This week is going to be the first time in a year that the president has had the opportunity to defend himself, to lay out the facts, to lay out the law, to lay out the actual substance. We have seen months and months and months of a one-sided show trial from House Democrats, where they didn't want to hear from the defense, where they shut out the White House, where they shut out the minority. The good news is, in the Senate, what I'm confident of is, we're going to have a fair trial. We're not going to give in to the kind of games that House Democrats have played. Instead, we're going to give both sides a full and fair opportunity to present their case. The House managers will have every opportunity to stand up and to present their arguments, to put forth whatever evidence they have. But for the first time, the president and the White House defense team is going to be able to walk through the facts and substance. And I think that's a very, very important development.

And if the only thing covered by the hearings was that now people agree. Everybody. Even our great Lieutenant Colonel, please call him Lieutenant Colonel or great Lieutenant Colonel agrees that the transcript was accurate. I think he had one word different. We'll change the one word, it meant absolutely nothing. The transcript was professionally done by the best people there. Just one second. So, we have a transcript. They never thought I'd release it. They probably never thought I had it. I can only say thank goodness they had it because otherwise I would have been falsely accused and it would have been sadly my word against them.

General Motors announced this week that it repaid its multibillion-dollar taxpayer-backed TARP loans. GM even bragged that it was able to repay the taxpayers in full, with interest, ahead of schedule, because more customers are buying [GM] vehicles. There was great fanfare, including expensive, around-the-clock GM TV commercials nationwide. But, the hype is not the reality. In fact, GM did not repay the loans with money it earned from selling cars. Instead, GM repaid the TARP loans with money it withdrew from another TARP fund at the Treasury Department.
Joe Biden is an amiable go-along-get-along politician. He needs to tell his half of the country to back off and oppose conviction of Trump at an impeachment trial because that will only divide our country further. He needs to tell his supporters to tear up their blacklists and stop seeking revenge against people who served our country in the Trump administration.

It would be disheartening and dangerous for our elected officials to remain locked in a partisan stalemate, given the enormity of the struggles facing the country and the dire need for bipartisan cooperation to bring an end to the coronavirus pandemic as quickly as possible, and to achieve real reform on the economy, health care, the environment, immigration and other issues.
The WHO plays a crucial role in the world's fight against the deadly COVID-19 pandemic as well as countless other threats to global health and health security, he said.

PENCE: Well, look, I think it was about a week and a half ago the president spoke to Speaker Pelosi in the Situation Room and said, look, if I gave you everything you wanted, if I reopen the government and gave you 30 days to work with us on homeland security issues, to address the crisis on our southern border, would you give me border security and funding for a wall? She said no.

And while you're at it, don't think about the Democratic candidates who are running for the United States Senate in Georgia. One of them is 33-year-old Jon Ossoff, and he has done literally not one impressive thing over the entire span of his life. Yet he could easily win because you haven't been paying attention. The other candidate is Rev. Raphael Warnock. He, by contrast, has done a lot of things. Here's one of them.

SPUNT: The nation's governors layering on extra protection in state
Although it is historically rare for freshmen members of Congress to obtain sought-after seats on top committees, progressive groups said they saw the news as a setback, as they hope to enact sweeping environmental and economic reforms in the coming years. The Steering and Policy Committee, chaired by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, formally assigns members to committees.
If President Obama can refuse to enforce a valid federal law affecting millions of people, are there any limits to his powers? After all, he has frequently threatened, Where Congress won't act, I will. What is to stop him from rewriting other laws with which he disagrees? Or to act where Congress has declined or refused to act? Can he abolish certain tax laws because Congress chooses to keep them? Can he banish all sources of energy except renewables to advance his agenda on climate change? If so, why even have a legislative branch of government? What's the point of a Constitution which enumerates and circumscribes powers and duties?

Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, sought to frame Trump's support for a steel barrier as progress in the negotiations, saying on NBC's Meet the Press that if he has to give up a concrete wall, replace it with a steel fence in order to do that so that Democrats can say, 'See? He's not building a wall anymore,' that should help us move in the right direction.
For instance, the House is set to adopt rules that would, its authors claim, honor all gender identities by forbidding the use of words like mother or sister; going forward, House members could only use terms like parent or sibling.

It was a clear jab at Trump, who as both a candidate and as president has repeatedly refused to release federal income tax returns.

Fortunately, the vice president is going to make it 51 on important issues, Sanders said. And I believe that in this unprecedented moment in American history, when we face so many crises, the Senate is going to have to be as bold as it possibly can in protecting working families.
But, really, what the president did over the last month, and notably over the last two weeks, was direct our team to meet with rank-and-file Democrats, to find out what they were looking for. You know the legislative process traditionally is Republicans would offer their solutions, Democrats would offer amendments, but the president said, look, we want -- we want to put it all on the table.

WALLACE: But -- but does this bother you because it gives him a PR bonanza and it also weakens the international sanctions. Since Singapore last July -- or June, rather, the Chinese are trading more with them, the Russians are trading more with them. So you're giving them a lot. And so far we've gotten nothing.

Venezuela's Defense Minister decried the presence of any armed group, but did not acknowledge the existence of the ELN as the perpetrators.
SLOTKIN: I mean, for me, it's mission, right? You have a mission. And when you're serving in the CIA or military, you wake up every day, you know what you're doing and why you're doing it.

JORDAN: Well, we have talked with the White House counsel's team, but they got a great team. And, look, you got great lawyers, and you got all the facts and the truth on your side. So I think this is going to go well for the president, because, again, when you got the facts, when you got the truth, you just go make the arguments. And they got a great group of folks they have put together who are going to do just that over the next couple weeks.
