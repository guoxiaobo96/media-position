Anyway, ultimately, the former president will be acquitted. This is nothing but political theater, another Schiff show that will enflame tensions in already divided country.
Newly-elected Utah senator Mitt Romney kicked off 2019 with an op-ed in the Washington Post that savaged Donald Trump's character and leadership. Romney's attack and Trump's response Wednesday morning on Twitter are the latest salvos in a longstanding personal feud between the two men. It's even possible that Romney is planning to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. We'll see.

SLOTKIN: I think the nice thing is, we have over 100 new members in a body of 435 people. Any organization with that many new people, the culture changes. So I'm not saying it's going to be easy, and I've seen it already, you know, that sucking sound of people trying to get you to be very political, you know, salute the party instead of the country. You've got to be strong enough to push back. And that happens when you have people that you can link arms with and say, no, we're not going to do it that way, and I think we have that.
Speaking to reporters later in the day, Trump said he had told aides to say that they wanted a steel barrier, rather than the concrete wall he promised during the campaign. Trump said Democrats don't like concrete, so we'll give them steel.
After no candidate in either of Georgia's two U.S. Senate elections got more than 50% of the vote on Nov. 3, the top two candidates in each race moved on to the Jan. 5 runoffs. Republican Sen.

The company estimated that revenue from sports betting would reach $2.6 billion to $3.1 billion this year, an increase of as much as 100% over the $1.55 billion it estimates will have been generated from sports betting in 2020 (December figures have not yet been reported from most states).
Tedros delivered a speech praising Zimbabwe as, A country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the center of its policies to provide healthcare to all. Now, that's lunatic.

The rules package also establishes a climate-change committee. The Select Committee on the Climate Crisis lacks some of the same legislative teeth that its predecessor committee wielded when Democrats last controlled the House. But, the House rules give the panel until March 31, 2020 to make recommendations to other committees for actual policy changes and legislation.

Fortunately, there are no national elections this year so the press of partisanship could take a back seat to progress. Just maybe 2019 will be the year that America returns to its political senses, reduces gridlock, cuts good trade deals and enjoys a strong economy. On January 4, 2019, those predictions seem somewhat crazy as we are in a partial government shutdown, headed for an impeachment and many believe a recession is around the corner. Call me an optimist.
So for more than 30 days, Love City Brewing and roughly 7,000 local and independently owned breweries nationwide have been squeezed – new releases have been placed on hold, interstate shipments have been halted and grand openings pushed back.
But Republicans three years ago put a cap on the amount of non-federal taxes that could be deducted at $10,000. Democrats and some Republicans in high-tax states have been trying to repeal the cap to no avail as Republicans in the heartland argue they shouldn't be helping out blue states.

Although planned portions of the rules relating to the House's handling of ObamaCare were tabled for the future, the 234-197 vote marked a decisive defeat of New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's opposition to the measure.
Despite progressive pushes for sweeping legislative changes, the chances of getting something like Medicare-for-All or a Green New Deal passed are very slim. That's because most major legislation needs to overcome a 60-vote procedural threshold to advance to a final vote.

WSOC-TV: After Republican 9th Congressional District candidate Mark Harris finished addressing Mecklenburg County Republicans at the Charlotte Mecklenburg Government Center Monday night, reporters, including Eyewitness News reporter Joe Bruno, tried to ask him questions. Harris and a group of three or four other people used a fire exit to leave the Government Center as reporters attempted to ask questions. After Harris opened the door on the ground level, an alarm sounded. An unidentified man tried to block reporters from using the fire escape to follow Harris. When questioned if he worked for the city, the man allowed reporters to pursue the politician. Reporters continued to volley questions at Harris after he exited through the fire escape, but he sprinted across East 3rd Street and into the parking lot of the First Baptist Church of Charlotte, where he used to be a pastor. Harris then got into a car which sped off in the opposite direction of reporters. After the bizarre exit, in a tweet to Eyewitness News Reporter Joe Bruno, Harris said he had to get home to watch the college football National Championship game.

I saw my career destroyed, reputation ruined, and savings depleted by legal expenses as I defended myself against crimes my accusers knew I did not commit.
However, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is one of the agencies affected by the ongoing shutdown, and many IRS workers are among the nearly 800,000 federal workers currently furloughed.

I want to play something that Elizabeth Warren had said going back to this Bloomberg issue where he does this mea culpa for standing up for stop and frisk, and makes comments about disproportionate crime. Then he walks them back, and he's just throwing money into this race, $150 million already spent, going to spend half-a-billion, I guess, on this race. This is what she said about Bloomberg. Watch.
Instead of jobs, health care or border security, the incoming Democrat majority in the House is making a so-called reform package their first legislative priority in the new Congress. The bill consists of speech-stifling regulations under the guise of campaign finance reform, voting reform that puts automatic voter registration ahead of election integrity, and the overtly political action of income tax return disclosure that applies to the president but not Congress. It should be noted that this effort has a zero percent chance of passing the Senate, much less being signed into law.
The GOP's 53-member majority can weather several defections in the Senate, and Trump has threatened to use his veto power to defeat any legislation to reopen the government without wall funding. But the indications on Wednesday that some Republicans are increasingly wary of the shutdown, which Trump has said could last for years, highlighted the potential political pitfalls of leaving hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed or without pay. (Some 380,000 are furloughed, and approximately 420,000 are working without pay.)
We also lowered taxes. I was the author and wrote the largest income tax reduction in state history, being chair of Ways and Means. And what that did is, we specifically looked at individual income tax, and when you cut income tax, it dramatically grew our state. Our economy just took off, Feenstra said. And that put us in, right now we have over a billion dollars in cash reserves because the economy just took off in the state of Iowa... That is something I continue to look at, is how you can grow your economy. Because when it comes to debt, there's two ways you can do it. You can either cut or you can grow the economy.
That's not what he's talking about. He's basically talking simply and almost entirely about what to do with people that are here in an unlawful status, of which I think the majority of Americans believe we need to do something. But you can only do something after you've gotten place immigration reforms that allow you to secure the border and stop illegal immigration, otherwise doing something is going to encourage more people to come.

By a full percentage point, that's the lowest percentage since Gallup began compiling mentions of economic issues in 2001.

After all, he has frequently threatened, Where Congress won't act, I will. What is to stop him from rewriting other laws with which he disagrees?

Can he banish all sources of energy except renewables to advance his agenda on climate change? If so, why even have a legislative branch of government?

Manufacturing has literally been in recession. Part of that has come from the damage from the tariffs. Another part has been that the tax cuts did not seem to generate anything close to the kind of sustained improvement that was promised.

All these flaws are reflected in his tweets, which are the principal way a lazy media and commentariat have come to evaluate Trump and his presidency. They turn on their phones, read, and react. Nothing could be easier, and nothing could be more misleading. Because in the end history will judge Donald Trump not on his tweets but his deeds. And these, by and large, have reflected his undeniable virtues.

And so we are over at our wonderful affiliate, WTTG, in northwest Washington. But we are going to put on a show today.

But, really, what the president did over the last month, and notably over the last two weeks, was direct our team to meet with rank-and-file Democrats, to find out what they were looking for. You know the legislative process traditionally is Republicans would offer their solutions, Democrats would offer amendments, but the president said, look, we want -- we want to put it all on the table. In a very real sense, what President Trump did hear was he set the table for a deal that will address the crisis on our border, secure our border and give us a pathway to reopen the government.

McCarthy retreats from efforts to overturn election - WSJ: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said President Trump bore responsibility for last week's violence at the U.S. Capitol, but opposed efforts to impeach the president. 'The president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack by mob rioters,' Mr. McCarthy said in a speech on the House floor. The GOP leader said he opposes impeachment and would instead support an investigation into the riot and censuring the president. Democrats do not support a censure resolution. … Mr. McCarthy seemed to chastise members of his own conference when Wednesday he said: 'What we saw last week was not the American way. Neither is the continued rhetoric that Joe Biden is not the legitimate president.' In votes cast after the storming of the Capitol last week, Mr. McCarthy sided with a majority of House Republicans to object to Mr. Biden's wins in Arizona and Pennsylvania.

Budget reconciliation has more consequences for the Senate than the House. Debate time is capped at 20 hours and restricts amendments. Such strictures for debate and amendments aren't rare in the House. But budget reconciliation curbs Senate filibusters. It takes 60 votes to hurdle a filibuster – often twice – on garden variety bills. Senators can block an effort to summon a piece of legislation to the floor and again to halt debate. But the elite nature of a budget reconciliation package prohibits senators from gumming up the works at either stage. It takes a mere simple majority to approve amendments and adopt the final product. In fact, senators may only make points of order (suggesting that the Senate isn't operating properly) to certain amendments or other provisions in the package and then vote to waive the Budget Act. But waiving the Budget act requires a supermajority of 60 votes.

CRUZ: I think it is certainly possible that this trial could last one to two weeks. On the other hand, if the Senate makes decision to go down the road of additional witnesses, that could extend it six, eight weeks, or even longer. So I think there are really two paths here. But what you just noted there is important. This week is going to be the first time in a year that the president has had the opportunity to defend himself, to lay out the facts, to lay out the law, to lay out the actual substance. We have seen months and months and months of a one-sided show trial from House Democrats, where they didn't want to hear from the defense, where they shut out the White House, where they shut out the minority. The good news is, in the Senate, what I'm confident of is, we're going to have a fair trial. We're not going to give in to the kind of games that House Democrats have played. Instead, we're going to give both sides a full and fair opportunity to present their case. The House managers will have every opportunity to stand up and to present their arguments, to put forth whatever evidence they have. But for the first time, the president and the White House defense team is going to be able to walk through the facts and substance. And I think that's a very, very important development.

Take today's booming economy, for example. Gross domestic product growth is cranking at a nearly 3 percent annual rate, and even reached a 4.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter of last year. This is a feat that former President Obama famously claimed that President Trump would need a magic wand to accomplish.

The spate of executive orders, many of them aimed at reversing Trump policies, are important but also something of a blur. Yes, the president is expanding food stamps, postponing evictions, promoting equality, canceling the Keystone pipeline, rejoining the Paris climate pact and the WHO--and, yesterday, lifting the ban on transgender troops and ordering the purchase of more American goods. But he can only do so much by signing a piece of paper.

However, other Republicans are applying Trump's populist brand of conservatism to argue for new government spending and powers. They are more comfortable using the powers of government to level the playing field and counter the influence of large corporations.

There has also been talk of proposing payroll tax cuts, Congressional sources tell FOX Business.

The Google-owned platform said it removed content that was uploaded on January 12 from the Donald J. Trump channel for inciting violence, although it was not immediately clear which videos in question were in violation. 'After careful review, and in light of concerns about the ongoing potential for violence, we removed new content uploaded to the Donald J.

ANALYST DISILLUSIONED WITH JOURNALISM AND 'TRUMP CIRCUS': Longtime military analyst William Arkin has stepped down from his role at NBC News with a scathing letter criticizing the current state of journalism as well as President Donald Trump ...

Whether it's permanent funding for HBCUs, historically black colleges and universities, or criminal justice reform, Opportunity Zones, heirs property, working on sickle cell anemia, this president has been delivering for three years.
Adapted from Tucker Carlson's monologue from Tucker Carlson Tonight on January 2, 2019.
WALLACE: The president said on Friday that he has the right, and he's even considering, and you heard it from Sarah Sanders just a moment ago, declaring a national emergency and building a wall in his own without congressional approval using funds that have been appropriated for military construction. If he goes ahead and does that, what will House Democrats like yourself do?

Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, sought to frame Trump's support for a steel barrier as progress in the negotiations, saying on NBC's Meet the Press that if he has to give up a concrete wall, replace it with a steel fence in order to do that so that Democrats can say, 'See?

Some Wall Street executives said they found it odd that Kudlow and the White House would be planning a fiscal stimulus in the face of what appears to be a booming economy and low unemployment. Those executives think that a stimulus would not be planned unless they believed there was a good chance an economic slowdown might occur as the 2020 race heats up.
Trump tweets out something on a decision that's already going to be made and all of a sudden, it's a new impeachable offense. I mean this is laughable.

It's one thing to fight when necessary, but it's another to fight everyone, including your allies, almost all the time, in ways that go too far, culminating in a takeover of the Capitol by pro-Trump forces.

The setting for the rally was atypical for Trump: a Jersey Shore city where people camped out overnight on the beach to get a spot in line for the rally being held at a boardwalk convention center. Campaign officials touted the raucous crowd, one that did not have many chances to see Trump in person and may draw in voters from the nearby battleground state of Pennsylvania.

EMANUEL: Still, the new majority leader is making the case at trial is necessary.
Moving a key embassy: In May 2018, Trump fulfilled a key campaign promise by opening the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem and recognizing the city as the true capital of Israel. The international community largely does not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital as it is claimed by both Israel and the Palestinians. Previously, the U.S. kept its embassy in Tel Aviv, like other countries.

I think that's quite possible. And I think that's the future of the Republican Party because, frankly, on that I think depends the future of the country.
Equally important, the post-Trump Republican Party is in shambles after an absolutely disastrous week.

In 1996, Congress passed a law which requires federal immigration agents to deport illegal immigrants, with few exceptions. The statutory language is mandatory. Thus, whatever prosecutorial discretion which may have existed previously, was specifically eliminated by that legislative act. Yet, the President is now, in effect, ordering those agents to break the law. He cannot, on his own, engage in a de facto repeal of this law by executive action. To do so would be, quite simply, lawlessness and a dereliction of his duty.

Similarly, it is clear from her first year in office that Loeffler has a clear focus on Georgia. She has been crisscrossing the state helping solve problems and cutting red tape in the federal government to get aid to Georgia communities and businesses. In the Senate, she fought for the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which helped return agriculture and manufacturing jobs to Georgia. She has fought against radical pro-abortion proposals. And her work on the Veterans Affairs Committee has helped ensure Georgia's veterans get the health care they deserve – and the training and education they need to succeed after their military service.

One of the most powerful platforms Donald Trump ran on was his opposition to China. He understood what people in regular America thought about China, what they had seen China doing to regular Americans' jobs over the past three decades that politicians in both parties had ignored for decades.

And certainly not when it comes to trade in automobiles and auto parts. For this reason, I intend to review the president's use of power under Section 232 of the Trade Act of 1962, which grants the president broad legal authority to impose tariffs in the name of national security. I'm not fond of the Section 301 tariffs on products from China, but I agree with the reasons they've been applied.

James Madison, who kept the notes at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787 -- notes that eventually formed much of the language of the Constitution -- made clear what the purposes of the Constitution were: to prescribe discrete areas of human endeavor in which the new federal government could legislate; to set forth open-ended areas of human behavior in which no government could legislate; and to leave the remaining areas of governmental endeavor in the hands of the states. The areas delegated to the federal government are only 17 in number and generally are referred to as federal powers. The areas in which no government may regulate are infinite and generally are referred to as natural rights.

Airbnb cancels all inauguration bookings - Politico: Airbnb announced Wednesday that it would cancel all reservations in the Washington, D.C., area during the week of Joe Biden's inauguration to discourage guests from traveling to the nation's capital. The popular home rental company said in a statement that it would also take action to block any new reservations from being made in the area. Guests who made reservations prior to the new decision will have their stays refunded, and hosts will be compensated by the company for money they would have earned from the canceled reservations. The move follows pleas from local authorities, including Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, strongly discouraging travel to the city after last week's deadly riots at the U.S. Capitol. Airbnb also announced that it had banned 'numerous individuals' from its platform who participated in the insurrection or were linked to known hate groups.

INGRAHAM: Today, Mike Pompeo gave a very forceful press conference on the fallout from the Iranian jetliner going down. His concern is that people aren't understanding the imminent nature of the threat of Soleimani, and he was pressed on that today. He said, there were large scale attacks planned on U.S. facilities, but he didn't go more specific. Don't the American people have a right to know what specifically was targeted without revealing methods and sources?

I am hopeful and I believe that senators will do their constitutional duty, which means that they're not going to decide this case based on friendship, but, rather -- there was a reason that the framers of the Constitution gave the responsibility of conducting an impeachment trial to the Senate. They debated quite a bit where to do the impeachment, particularly of a president.

I want everybody, but there are things you can't do from the standpoint of Executive Privilege. You have to maintain that. So, we'll see where it all goes. But especially, a National Security Adviser, you can't have him explaining all of your statements about national security concerning Russia, China, North Korea, everything. We just can't do that. I think for the good of the office. Look, Nancy Pelosi will go down as probably the least successful Speaker of the House in the history of our nation. She has done nothing. The only thing she's done is she finally get done one of the best trade deals our country has ever made, the USMCA. That's with Mexico and Canada. But I did that. She doesn't even know what it says. She has no idea what it says. She was forced to do that. You know why? She wouldn't have done it, but she did nothing. So, now she can say, I signed something. She is obsessed with impeachment. She has done nothing. She's going to go down as one of the worst Speakers in the history of our country. Now, in all fairness, she's hurting our country. She's very bad for our country and she's become a crazed lunatic.

Medicare-for-all threatens to make the same exact mistake ObamaCare made – expanding health care coverage over controlling health care costs. But think for a moment. Why do millions of Americans, even after years of ObamaCare, still lack health insurance? The answer is simple: It is too expensive.

Fortunately, we'll be able to see this week where members of the U.S. Senate stand on allowing Carol Browner to direct taxpayer dollars and pursue vast new regulatory power grabs. Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana has introduced an amendment (SA 2440) to the Department of the Interior appropriations bill that prohibits any federal funding for Browner's policy directives. Any senator who votes against it is voting to support not just Carol Browner, but also her vast regulatory power grab and the president's system of unaccountable czars.

Social conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, and yet reach a strikingly similar conclusion. The real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the American family is collapsing. Nothing can be fixed before we fix that. Yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. The idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. They refuse to consider it. Questioning markets feels like apostasy.

RAY: Well, I think he's right about that. But I think you have also saw from the speaker, Pelosi, about essentially celebrating the notion that the stain of impeachment exists and exists forever. And the only rejoinder to that -- and that's the rejoinder that it is my job, and together with the rest of the defense team, to place before the United States Senate for their consideration -- is the question about the rejoinder being that there will be an acquittal forever as well. And that's what we expect. That's the -- that's the task ahead during the next several weeks.

On the economy today, we found out that still added 146,000 jobs, unemployment historically low at 3.5 percent.

While we are surely at or very near full employment, as of November (the most recent month for which we have the data) there were still about 1 million more job openings than people unemployed. This is strong evidence that the competition for employees that has been driving wage growth will continue. With more people employed at higher wages and taking home more of what they earn (thanks to the Republican tax cuts), consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of our economic growth, should remain strong.

Ocasio-Cortez had voted with Khanna to oppose the so-called pay-go rule included in the rules package, supported by Pelosi.

WALENSKY: You know, from the data that I've seen so far, my understanding is that the current supply crunch is the one that is -- I'm most worried about. We have every indication that over time we'll get more and more vaccine. So we certainly can't predict any of the -- the obstacles that would come in our way here. But from the data that I've seen so far, I'm hopeful that we'll actually get an increasing amount of supply, not a stagnating one. WALLACE: And -- and is there a specific point in this whole run that you're particularly worried about in -- in the next two or three months that you think the first doses will have run out and we won't have geared up for a second run? WALENSKY: You know, we are carefully monitoring the second doses that are going to be required in the time ahead so that people who have gotten their first dose will have access to their second dose.
We absolutely have had cases of terrorists crossing the southern border, Nielsen said.

BENSON: Because it was so explosive. And I think that the president was going to be damaged by the story even being out there.

It also calls for a universal program to build and retrofit energy efficient housing and huge new green public transportation projects. Like the Green New Deal, the Leap Manifesto encourages a more localized and ecologically-based agricultural system, and it proposes the creation of a universal basic annual income program. Also in line with the Green New Deal, it demands raising existing taxes and the creation of a carbon-dioxide tax.

However, President Obama has commandeered this elastic doctrine of prosecutorial discretion and stretched or manipulated it beyond all recognition and reason. It has become his political Gumby toy with which he exerts his will whenever he fails to get his way with Congress. He contorts the word discretion to adopt a capacious policy -- his own policy -- to ban full enforcement of a duly enacted immigration statute. He treats the doctrine as a magical incantation shielding his arbitrariness.
By undermining our energy dominance, Biden once again puts us at the mercy of foreign regimes, many of whom use those new-found billions of dollars against America and our allies.

ROMNEY: Well, I think it would be unrealistic to assume that Democrats and Republicans are going to see eye to eye on every issue. There are going to be differences of opinion, that's expected. But at the same time, I think it's appropriate for us to have unity of purpose, unity of heart, a recognition that we respect each other and treat each other with comity and that is something which I believe President Biden wants to see.

Exiting from the Paris climate accord: As a candidate, Trump promised to cancel the Paris Climate Agreement, a pact by nearly 200 nations to voluntarily reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change.

What we can do is tag-team this message so that every community can hear it that needs to hear it. And I think that that kind of solidarity across lines is very, very powerful.

Combined with the re-signing of top priority DJ The Machine LeMahieu to a six-year, $90-million pact and avoiding arbitration with eight players, the Yankees provided a great deal more clarity to both their roster and their payroll.

It's a choice, it's a stark contrast between the freedoms — our way of life here in Georgia — or socialism, government control, she said. We know the agenda of the left because Chuck Schumer told us he was going to take Georgia and then change America. And we know that radical agenda is not just high taxes, open borders, defunding the police, government-run health care, but he has radical candidates in this race, his agents of change.
Of course, that is not the only tactic Democrats might use to expand their grip on the country. Other ambitions include stacking the Supreme Court, welcoming reliably blue Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., as states, and abolishing the Electoral College.

Long before the Supreme Court ruled in a highly questionable 2007 case, Massachusetts v. EPA, that the EPA has the legal authority to justify its proposed 18,000 pages of greenhouse gas regulation under the Clean Air Act, Browner (then EPA director under President Bill Clinton) had her general counsel, Jonathan Cannon, prepare a now-infamous memorandum arguing�for the first time�that the EPA possessed such a power. At the time it was dismissed as a wild-eyed overreach that Congress would never allow. Now it's happening, and Browner is right at the center of it.

millions of people who do not believe that the process ultimately was fair
A desire to slow the Bloomberg Express – which has seen the candidate spend big on TV ads and campaign staff, as well as attract key endorsements around the country – is something that Sanders and other Democrats running for president have in common with the current office holder.
So, that should tell people a lot of things, the chief justice of the Supreme Court is not coming over because it's not an impeachment of the president which is what the Constitution says.
Biden also faces a tough calendar, with a two-week window before the Senate impeachment trial of his predecessor. While that should allow time to confirm many of his nominees, given the media's continuing addiction to Donald Trump, the trial will take the spotlight off Biden's Covid relief bill in ways that could sap his momentum.
THE RULEBOOK: A POWERFUL HOUSE, TWO YEARS AT A TIME
TRUMP: He totally violated. This man totally violated the Logan Act with his conversations. OK. But when Kerry was out there and making the deal and they had people screaming, Death to America, Death to America, who signs a deal while they're screaming Death to America.

The timeline for Democratic control is contingent on the swearing in of Ossoff and Warnock, which isn't expected to occur until after Georgia certifies the election results. The deadline for the Georgia certification is Jan. 22.
Both in his speech in Somersworth and in an address Wednesday morning at Politics and Eggs at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics – a must-stop for White House hopefuls – Castro spelled out his progressive proposals, which included universal pre-K education so that every kid can start off with a good education.

It's always been this Faustian bargain with Trump, Dan Eberhart, CEO of a Denver drilling-services company, told the Financial Times. He liked Trump's tax cut and pro-growth policies and gave $100,000 to groups supporting the president and helped raise another $600,000. But after Wednesday's violence at the Capitol, he told the FT: I'm done. I don't want my mom to think I'm involved with this.
During his time on the campaign trail, Trump became an almost constant foil for Newsom. In March, Newsom put out a campaign ad calling the president's proposed border wall a monument to idiocy and referred to Trump as a small, scared bully.
RAY: Well, that's a -- that's a relevant issue to consider, obviously, because, if you get into the question, as the Democrats have alleged, that anything having to do with the Bidens was completely, in their words, a sham, obviously, your views about that are affected by whether or not you think there was merit to a Biden investigation. But before we ever get to that, I think the core issue -- and Senator Cruz alluded to this -- well-founded -- and I have said this many times -- many times on your show -- well-founded articles of impeachment both allege that crimes were committed and that those are the type of crimes that constitute abuse of the public trust. Abuse of power alone -- and history has shown this -- similar to also obstruction of Congress, those types of articles of impeachment have been tried on for size before, but they have not fared well. The core of the impeachment parameters allege that crimes have been committed, treason, bribery, and things like that, in other words, other high crimes and misdemeanors.

The citizenship question represents the third time since October that Francisco is seeking the court's intervention without an appellate ruling. The other two involved Obama-era programs to shield young immigrants from deportation and allow transgender people to serve in the military.
The constitution frankly be damned, and Joe Biden now wants statehood for Washington, D.C., which would then give him two new -- on their minds -- Democratic senators in perpetuity, and he also still supports ending the legislative filibuster, as we learned today.
- Trump 'would have standing to challenge' his impeachment trial: Turley
SIEGEL: Do you feel that here in the U.S., we're better off prepared.
There's more at stake than taxes. If Jon Ossoff and Rafael Warnock win, and Democrats take control of the Senate on Jan. 5, many of the rights and freedoms you cherish are at risk. Moreover, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Schumer, two dishonest partisans who fought President Trump every moment of the past four years, will run the nation.
Why did you come out Saturday afternoon to talk about that? Did he tell you, Sean, I'm upset about this, I want you to come out?
There is still a lot of moderate voices in the party that did not learn the lessons of 2016 and are not listening to what people need in this country, de Blasio told CNN's Jake Tapper on State of the Union. So I want to push this whole party, and I want to inform this debate in this country about the fact that we could go a lot further, we could be a lot bolder than what we're doing now.
I strongly support efforts to take further action to increase funding for border security and begin to fix our broken immigration system. That said, I don't believe shutting down the government is the best course of action. Instead, we should fund border security, end the partial government shutdown, and then continue to fight to get even more border security funding in the long term, Gardner said in a statement provided to Fox News.
That includes Alice Johnson, whose story millions of Americans saw during Sunday's Super Bowl.
And, although hats have been barred in the House chamber for more than a century, a new House rule states that this prohibition does not include religious headwear. That means the rules will still preclude Democratic Florida Rep. Frederica Wilson from wearing her signature cowboy hats on the House floor -- but Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Muslim, will be permitted to wear a hijab.

Folks already know that any Democratic candidate is going to need to take on the president and that they are anti-Trump. So spending some time at the beginning explaining who they are, what they have to offer, why they are running, is an important part of the calculus, added Elleithee, a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee.
Back in October, the mainstream media offered little to no coverage of the bombshell reporting from the New York Post that shed light on Hunter Biden's shady business dealings overseas.

The first episode of 2019 opened with Mike arriving at Ryan's pot store in order to give him some tax papers and handle a few of his more clerical things.

That would not only be catastrophic for Republicans, it would be a colossal mistake for the country and would contradict the will of most of the electorate including independents and many Democrats.
Sanders has signaled a willingness to pass legislation without GOP support by using this special process that's reserved for tax and fiscal matters. The first test could be Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief legislation that is the first priority for the new Democratic administration.

Here's what to know about the Georgia runoffs.
That's a false narrative on the left because they don't want people to know that Trump has minority support.
We can say first of all there's been no American president like him. Not Andrew Jackson, not Abraham Lincoln, not Harry Truman, who were all seen as highly unorthodox presidents and were vilified by the elite opinion of their time, can hold a candle to Trump's breaking of every expectation of what a president is and how he should behave. No doubt Trump sees himself as a model of leadership; but it's not leadership according to any model we're accustomed to.
BAIER: Right. Well, some of your other Republican colleagues have called
The topic has been a contentious one for the president since his time on the campaign trail in 2016, and throughout his administration, as he refuses to release his financial information. Trump has claimed that his tax returns are complicated, and has maintained that he will not release them while they are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service.
As two concerned leaders who represent these very communities, we're raising the alarm about President Biden's heavy-handed and job-killing executive actions. One of us, Rep.

Donald Trump did not create those things. He -- he got elected because of those things. He got 75 million votes because of those things.

That's why he got elected and that's what I hope we'll be a party of.

Two weeks into his presidency, Obama expanded the state Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) by roughly $35 billion over the next five years. The expanded program was financed with a 62-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes.

If Republicans win even one of the Georgia races, they'll hold a Senate majority for the next two years and have an effective veto over President-elect Joe Biden's agenda. If Democrats sweep both races, however, the Senate will be at an effective 50-50 tie on party lines. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would then be able to break ties on party-line votes.

Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), the largest socialist organization in the United States. DSA doesn't merely want to create new government-run social programs, it desires, in the words of a member of DSA and the editor of the socialist magazine Jacobin, to in the long run … end capitalism. On its website, DSA blames, in part, the globalization of capital for racism, sexism, homophobia, and environmental degradation.

Meanwhile, in the House, there was limited GOP support on Wednesday for Democrats' spending bill agenda as well. On Wednesday, the Democratic-led House approved a bill to fund the Treasury Department, the IRS and other agencies for the next year as part of a strategy to reopen the government on a piecemeal basis, but Senate Republicans dismissed the attempt as a nonstarter without any wall funding.
The annual CBO update of the government's economic and fiscal health estimates a $1 trillion deficit for the ongoing fiscal year, which would bring the red ink above $1 trillion for the first time since 2012, when former President Barack Obama capped four consecutive years of $1 trillion-plus budget deficits.

In addition, populist Republicans are more likely to find common ground with populist Democrats like Sen.

Hawley expressed frustration that a measure that would pass the Senate can't even get a vote.
If the idea here is to create jobs, there is a less expensive and much more effective way to get employers to hire and workers to get back in the labor market. We could completely eliminate for an entire year the 7.5% payroll taxes paid by every small business and taken out of every worker's paycheck. That would unleash millions of jobs. This would have virtually ZERO administrative and bureaucratic costs. Maybe that's why Washington pols don't want to do it.

Biden has got an uphill battle in New Hampshire after a lackluster showing in Iowa, landing some hope to campaigns for Senators Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren, now polling close to Biden in a contest for third place. The field as we know it faces another shake-up again. Mega billionaire candidate Michael Bloomberg is yet to enter the race. He skipped early primary states like New Hampshire and begins his campaign in earnest on Super Tuesday -- Sean.
Sen. David Perdue isn't lifting a finger to fight for the $2,000 stimulus checks that President Trump supports.
According to a number of those who attended Wednesday's events, the big push began after Trump tweeted on Dec. 19: Big protest in D.C. on January 6. Be there, be wild!

Looking to maintain that frontrunner status, Sanders in Nevada made the argument that Bloomberg – who launched his campaign late but is fueling it with his own seemingly limitless personal resources – cannot beat President Trump in November.

To be honest Trump's all these other things so yes, I understand how every member of the cabinet would prefer to have the Chief Executive just say, you've got this but in some cases like Eddie Gallagher who was unfairly treated, the navy seals or in the case of Roger Stone, the President having an opinion and if appropriate, the President using his ability to give clemency or pardoning, those are his rights.
Typically, voters are not in the position to know whether their senators or members of Congress will control the balance of power in either chamber when they cast their votes. There are usually too many states and too many possible outcomes for that.

However, when it comes to legalizing recreational marijuana, Democrats sing a much different tune. Many of the same folks who have been pushing for healthier school lunches, soda bans, lower salt content in food and calorie disclosures at restaurants suddenly don't care about legalizing a substance that has been scientifically proven to worsen our national public health crisis.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., reignited the call for a Green New Deal during her surge to Congress in the midterm elections. Her plan is a lofty one, calling for the federal government to invest trillions of dollars. In turn, she says, millions of high-wage jobs will be created. She compared her plan to the Marshall Plan, or the European Recovery Plan, where the U.S. gave around $15 billion to help Western Europe recover in the aftermath of World War II.
Ocasio-Cortez, sworn in as Congress' youngest member on Thursday, is one of a number of Democrats who backs the Green New Deal -- which aims to combat both climate change and income inequality with a massive and costly economic overhaul. Ocasio-Cortez has called it a wartime-level, just economic mobilization plan to get to 100% renewable energy.

Regardless, historians will dwell on the ensuing mayhem.
During her campaign, Ocasio-Cortez teamed up with Cynthia Nixon, the former Sex and the City actress who unsuccessfully ran against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the gubernatorial primary.
A WARNING TO PELOSI AND HOUSE DEMS: Republican strategist Colin Reed says House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats should not celebrate too long. They are about to be reminded that governing is a lot more difficult than making campaign promises - and Democrats are far from being united ... In an op-ed on FOXNews.com, Reed writes: House Democrats are about to find out that governing is harder than campaigning. Their majority is paved through 31 districts won by Trump in 2016 that flipped blue in 2018, many of which had resided in the GOP column for generations.
Minority voters will be consequential to the Georgia runoff elections, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said on Monday.

General Motors announced this week that it repaid its multibillion-dollar taxpayer-backed TARP loans. GM even bragged that it was able to repay the taxpayers in full, with interest, ahead of schedule, because more customers are buying [GM] vehicles. There was great fanfare, including expensive, around-the-clock GM TV commercials nationwide. But, the hype is not the reality. In fact, GM did not repay the loans with money it earned from selling cars. Instead, GM repaid the TARP loans with money it withdrew from another TARP fund at the Treasury Department.

Kody and his handler were examining luggage at the New Jersey airport when the dog alerted the CBP officer to a suspicious suitcase containing the meat. The passenger who claimed the suitcase admitted he had brought the 'homemade sausages,' officials said. Swine meat cannot be imported into the U.S. from certain regions under U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations because of the risk of spreading an illness like foot-and-mouth disease. … The passenger who brought the homemade sausages was released without a penalty because he declared them when arriving in the country.

But Trump seemed more interested in adding spending he liked — such as military spending, his border wall, his long-promised infrastructure bill, and direct pandemic assistance — than in eliminating spending he did not like.
For that reason, getting distracted by side issues, like the minimum wage, would be a mistake. Bill Clinton made that blunder by talking about gays in the military at the very start of his term.

Yet the fact remains that this weekend, the president gave his lead negotiator very little room to negotiate, sending Pence to a meeting that Trump himself said would yield nothing. This, coupled with the moments over the past month when Trump has publicly undermined Pence's messaging, has helped create a portrait of a vice president with diminishing influence.

Sanders campaign seems energized in tonight's huge showing and his comfortable lead over Democratic rivals in the final two New Hampshire tracking polls before voting begins. Today, Sanders took swipes at both former Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden for taking campaign contributions from billionaires.
Its guiding principle is the belief that government -- not individuals -- is the chief engine of human progress. If that means government tearing down rich persons to help poor persons, if that means the massive redistribution of wealth, if it means federal regulation of every conceivable occupation or productive endeavor, if it means fighting an unjust war, progressives are for it.

There's no doubt that Cohen will be asked about the hush-money payments he made to two women in exchange for not making public their unproven allegations – denied by Trump – of extramarital affairs that supposedly occurred many years before Trump ran for president.
The hunt for blood is so thick that the president's decision not to attend Biden's inauguration comes as a relief. Under the circumstances, his clear concession is enough to satisfy the requirement for a transition of power.
So, don't jump to conclusions. That's my advice to Republicans. They've got to keep their foot on the pedal for Trump.

I didn't even realize he was Ukrainian. I thought he was Israeli. The reality is, you don't know him that well. But that's the problem with how this world works, right? You take a couple pictures with somebody, if someone's a donor. They get in line. They sit at a dinner with 50 people. And that's how it works. The media then takes it, oh, they're buddies.

By the time the smoke cleared yesterday, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and more than 100 congressional Democrats were both calling for Trump to be removed through the 25th Amendment, or face a swift impeachment. But that just made it sound like the same old partisan dynamic of the first impeachment and both outcomes seemed remote. With less than two weeks until the inauguration, such an effort would have to be led by Trump's Cabinet, and that chatter is going nowhere.

SCOTT BOLDEN, FORMER D.C. DEMOCRATIC PARTY CHAIRMAN: I don't think the polls are very credible just based on not just anecdotal, but the mythology that somehow Donald Trump, because of the economy and because of black unemployment at its lowest level is going to translate into votes for Donald Trump.

The cars have base prices of $76,000 and $82,000, respectively, while the next-up 100 kWh versions cost $94,000 and $97,000, respectively. The added cost primarily brings a longer range between charges and a small performance bump. The move creates more space between the Model S and smaller Model 3, the most expensive version of which starts at $62,000.
But Democrats running against Trump — including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg — have all announced plans to expand federal spending and raise taxes.

But 18 states, the District of Columbia, 15 big cities or counties, and immigrants' rights groups sued the Commerce Department, which designs the census, and claimed it failed to properly analyze the effect that the question would have on households with immigrants. The challengers said the Trump administration added the question to discourage immigrants from participating, potentially leading to a population undercount — and possibly fewer seats in Congress — in places that tend to vote Democratic.
Yet today, we are witnessing a government that is beyond ideologically progressive. Does Obama understand that progressive ideas have consequences and that governmental behavior often has unintended consequences? It would appear not, as his long train of incompetence and indifference, grounded in progressive thought, keeps picking up speed. It is crushing human freedom, destroying human wealth and even taking human lives.

But history is written by the winners, and the mainstream media, by and large, are declaring that their years of warning that Trump was a dangerous character who could wreak havoc on society have now been vindicated. The press, which Trump attacked as recently as Wednesday morning as the enemy of the people, are now casting him as the real enemy, emboldened by those aides and supporters who are now trashing him both on the record and in blind quotes to reporters (a total monster, one administration official told the Washington Post).
RUBIO: The GOP is the party that nominated Donald Trump. And the reason why it did and ultimately got him elected and he got 75 million votes is because you have tens of millions of Americans that feel this economy isn't working for people like them, that feel socially displaced, even like strangers in their own country, and who believe that both of the parties, at least traditionally, and all of politics doesn't understand or care about any of this, that they don't matter to people.

The comments, from one of several longshot candidates entering what is likely to be a historically crowded field, highlight how the Russia probe and the prospect of Democrats someday delivering Trump's comeuppance – whether in the form of impeachment or, in Castro's case, the denial of a pardon – have factored into their campaigns, first in the midterms and now heading into 2020.

President Obama claims he is entitled to overhaul immigration laws in the name of prosecutorial discretion. It is one of those wonderfully fungible phrases in the law. Elastic because it is vague and ambiguous. Useful because it can be easily abused. Mr. Obama has appropriated this doctrine to argue he has near boundless discretion to amend, revise, waive or suspend the execution of immigration laws. As chief executive, he is empowering himself to decide what laws may be enforced or ignored and what persons may come or go across our southern border irrespective of what the law actually states.

Fox News: The House of Representatives Wednesday made history by voting to impeach President Trump for a second time for 'incitement of insurrection' after a mob of his supporters besieged the Capitol on Jan. 6 in a failed attempt to stop the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's electoral college win. The House voted 232-197 to impeach the president. Ten Republicans joined with Democrats. Trump has just one week left in office, but the supporters of the impeachment push say Trump is too dangerous to stay in office a minute longer. The impeachment resolution condemns Trump for spreading lies that he won the election in a landslide and whipping up a crowd of supporters in Washington D.C. before the riot that killed five people, including a Capitol Police officer. … Unlike the last House impeachment of Trump in December 2019 … Democrats had GOP support. Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican, backed impeachment because she said the violent attack at the Capitol could not have happened without Trump.

One other contributing factor to this is the Internet (the 'unending reservoir of dumpster juice'), specifically the willingness of people to believe all manner of nonsense if it is written in black and white and presented on a computer screen. In this case the impacts of 'internet illiteracy' were overtly political, but it touches many, many other aspects of our lives: teens sharing nudes on snapchat, mothers disowning daughters on Facebook.

A person could say we need to raise taxes a little bit, Reid told the Nevada Independent. Again, when you talk about 70 percent and all that, we have to be careful because the American people are very conservative in the sense of not wanting radical change quickly. It just doesn't work.
FOUNDING PARTNER, CAVALRY: Well, they certainly have the ability as a
McConnell took a victory lap on Monday after Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona firmly expressed their opposition to eliminating the legislative filibuster, something conservatives feared would pave the way for President Joe Biden to fully enact his agenda, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting tie-breaking votes.
BRUCE: Well, that's it. I don't think he can, too. He wants to run as being who he is as a gay man, but then he also wants to run as being someone else. And that's really breaking the barrier when it comes to identity politics, isn't it?
As previously reported by FOX Business, New Jersey had the highest number of outbound migrations of all 50 states last year – at a rate of 68.5 percent. And the highest percentage of residents that left the state were wealthy, with nearly half of all outbound migrations occurring at income levels of $150,000 or more.
Before his Supreme Court nomination, Garland was recognized for his role in the investigation and prosecution of the 1995 bombings of the Oklahoma City federal building that killed 168 people. In 1997, President Clinton nominated him to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, where he has served with distinction ever since, including as the chief judge of that court.

SEN. SHELLEY CAPITO'S BIG IDEA: EXPAND BROADBAND ACCESS TO BRING TECH JOBS TO RURAL AMERICA
The policy, first turned into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1985 and announced at a UN conference in Mexico City, has been repealed by Democratic presidents and reinstated by Republicans for decades. Biden's order will come almost four years to the day since former President Donald Trump signed an order that revived it.

So the president will face a stark choice. If he can make progress with the Republicans, he can pass a smaller, more targeted coronavirus bill and praise it as a bipartisan triumph. With a 50-50 Senate, even with Vice President Harris waiting in the wings, he can't lose a single Democratic vote. And he really needs 60 to avert a potential filibuster.

With fear-mongering now the stock and trade in the age of social media, this is supposed to be the year of the recession, and for the last six weeks a chorus of economists have been saying our economy is all but dead. But wait. Wages are rising, Christmas spending will set records, and the new jobs report out Friday showed a healthy job market with 312,000 jobs smashing through the downbeat estimates. Just maybe we still have a strong economy and that recession talk will have to wait a year. On the other hand, China may be in real trouble so it is likely that after having lost a third of the value of their stock market, they will come to the table and cut a deal. The base these Chinese leaders have to worry about favor bread over ideology.

SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Over the past few weeks, there have been several crucial disclosures of evidence that appear to further incriminate the President. Each disclosure bolstering the argument we Democrats have made for a trial that features the relevant witnesses and documents.
The land in question is the Seven Springs Estate which is composed of 213 acres across three towns north of New York City: North Castle, New Castle and Bedford. The lawyer for North Castle, Roland Baroni, told Fox News that town received a subpoena on December 16, 2020, and that it has fully complied with the request from the office of Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance Jr.

The president described in clear and direct language the human crises ranging from 300 of our children dying every week from heroin, 90 percent of which comes through those porous Mexican borders.
TRUMP: Well, they build an office building for $3 billion. They do lots of things that they shouldn't be doing before I got here. But I raised a lot of money. We can use NATO in other locations. We can use NATO as an example in the Middle East. And that's what we should do. I think frankly it's more palatable to countries in the Middle East, if an international force comes in rather than just the United States. And from our standpoint, let somebody else pay for it. Why are we always paying? We pay for everything. One thing, I moved our troops out of Syria - on the border between Turkey and Syria. That turned out to be such a successful move, Laura. Look what happened. Now they protect it. They've been fighting over that border for a thousand years. Why should we do it? And then they say, he left troops in Syria. You know what I did, I left troops to take the oil. I took the oil. The only troops I have are taking the oil. They're protecting the oil. I took over the oil.

The Georgia runoffs have been some of the most expensive two months of nonpresidential politics in American history. The total ad spending in the race has reached nearly $500 million.
One hundred years from now, a fair-minded assessment of Trump's presidency will recognize his abundant domestic and international accomplishments. Liberals unborn may be appalled. Conservatives unconceived may applaud. But both should agree that Trump was a consequential president whose sleeplessness achieved significant things, often while astonishing foes and friends alike.

With Democrats controlling both chambers and the White House after November's elections, it appeared more likely they could pass a stimulus package.
JORDAN: The best -- the best evidence that there was bias is, look at the names they gave the two investigations. The Clinton investigation, the code name they gave it was the Midyear Exam. But when it came to the Trump-Russia investigation, the FBI came up with Crossfire Hurricane. You can almost like see them pounding their chest like Tarzan. We're going to go get this president. We're going to go after Donald Trump. And that's exactly what they did. And never forget what Bill Barr said. Bill Barr said there was a crisis of leadership at the upper echelon of the FBI. That's the biggest understatement ever. Of course there was. Comey was fired. McCabe was fired, lied three times under oath. Jim Baker, chief counsel, had to resign. Lisa Page had to step down and resign as well, was kicked off the Mueller team, Peter Strzok kicked off the Mueller team and fired. So, those were the five key people who ran these investigations.

PENCE: Well, of course. The legislative process is a negotiation and up to this point, literally for the last month while the president and I have stayed here in Washington and been engaging continuously with Democrat leadership, and with rank-and-file members in the House and Senate, what we heard again and again is we will not negotiate until the president reopens the government.

If confirmed by the Senate, Power will head the U.S. Agency for International Development, which has an annual budget of about $20 billion.

I never rule things out because you never know what life brings, he told CNN. But I'm focused on the work I'm doing now and getting this message out.
But we know what Nancy Pelosi has said about them before. Remember when the riots were happening in Washington over the summer, Nancy Pelosi said the National Guard at the Lincoln Memorial, it was scary. They shouldn't be there, or in Portland in July when the riots were going on.

The assumption is that once those four footnotes which are declassified now are declassified, it will reveal that the investigation actually began further back, and that those sources mentioned in Horowitz's report particularly Stefan Halperin and others that were connected with the FBI, we'll see a trail of that leading prior to July 31st. And it will kind of turn the whole Horowitz report on its head, stating that the Crossfire Hurricane was a reason for opening the investigation. So, that was one.
Now, of course, the campaign has more cause for concern then Biden's deranged rantings that are frankly unhinged. There are dozens of legitimate questions about zero experience hunter and his shady business dealings, not only in Ukraine but China and other countries. And then quid pro quo Joe Ukrainian shakedown -- remember, you are not getting the billion dollars, $1 billion unless you fire that prosecutor investigating my zero experienced son. Wow.
Approving tax cuts: As a candidate, Trump promised to simplify the tax code and create massive cuts for Americans.

Ending the fossil-fuel industry would potentially destroy millions of jobs and require an unprecedented investment in expensive and unreliable renewable energy sources like wind and solar power generation. Even worse, because wind and solar cost two to five times more than existing conventional energy sources, requiring huge sectors of the economy to rely on these renewables would increase the cost of all goods and services and drive countless businesses out of the country.

HERMAN CAIN (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't think it is an opening for president Trump to woo black voters because President Trump is trying to woo the United States of America. The results that this president has been able to achieve have helped all people. That is the difference.

So to try to put them in a homogeneous group as one group all the time is a mistake. And all you have to do is look at the reputable polls, and you will see that the support for President Trump from black people has grown and grown and grown.

If he had toned himself down a notch or three, he could have kept many of the voters who liked his tough, blunt approach without losing as many women and college graduates, especially in the suburbs, who were turned off by his tweets and his demeaning behavior.

Democratic leaders have previously supported building border walls. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and other Democrats, including then-Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, supported the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized the construction of some 700 miles of fencing at the border. As of 2015, virtually all of that fencing had been completed, according to government figures.

BARTIROMO: And I know you're suing Twitter...
CNBC: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer will deliver the Democrats' response to President Donald Trump on Tuesday night following his Oval Office address to the nation about funding his proposed border wall. Pelosi and Schumer, who have led Democratic negotiations with the Trump administration amid a partial government shutdown that has now become the second-longest on record, will give their response from the speaker's balcony in the U.S. Capitol building after Trump's televised 9 p.m. ET address has finished. 'If his past statements are any indication,' then Trump's speech 'will be full of malice and misinformation,' the Democratic leaders said Monday night in a joint statement calling for Democrats to be given equal airtime. As the shutdown of roughly a quarter of the government stretched into its 18th day, both sides remained staunchly opposed to each others' proposals for a deal to fund nine federal departments.

If either of the two Republican incumbents — Sens. David Perdue or Kelly Loeffler — winds up winning, the GOP will hold a narrow 51-49 majority over Democrats in the Senate. If both win, Republicans will hold a 52-48 majority. This would enable a united Republican Party to block legislation backed by Biden and his fellow Democrats, forcing the incoming president to compromise on key initiatives.
White House counsel Pat Cipollone, also part of the defense, added: What they are asking you do is to throw out a successful president on the eve of an election, with no basis, and in violation of the Constitution.

An aide? A journalist? A U.S. Capitol Police officer? A custodian? And the last few days proved you don't need airplanes, hijackers, box cutters, chemical weapons, nerve agents, or even firearms to take out the Capitol. You just need people. That's ironic. The Capitol serves as the 'the people's house.' The legislative branch is supposed to be representatives of the people and the states. You can erect all of the barricades you want around the U.S. Capitol. Build automated barricades on the streets embroidering the Capitol complex. Keep the Air Force jet fighters hot 24/7 at Joint Base Andrews across the Potomac to shoot down an intruding plane. … But, it turns out, the weapon to pierce the Capitol wasn't a gun. It wasn't a bomb. It wasn't a truck. People were the weapon.

Now, I understand Joe Biden comes from the left of center. I understand all that. But this is -- some of these are far left of center ideas. So my point in that tweet was, he may use the language, the rhetoric, even the demeanor of a centrist, but so far his policies don't seem to represent that. And -- and I think that's an important thing to note as we get into these debates about different issues.
The case, Montana Department of Revenue v. Espinoza, centers around a tax-credit scholarship program passed in May 2015 that gave Montanans up to a $150 credit for donating to private scholarship organizations, helping students pay for their choice of private schools. The state's revenue department made a rule banning those tax-credit scholarships from going to religious schools before the state's Supreme Court later struck down the entire law.

But caveat emptor. There is an inherent landmine which comes with reconciliation. It's called the Byrd Rule, the namesake of the legendary, late Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-WV). The practical impact of the Byrd rule is that extraneous legislative priorities can't fall under reconciliation. Some examples include whether a provision cuts or raises taxes or revenues, adds to the deficit or isn't related to budgetary matters. Senators may make a point of order to flag a non-compliant provision. As mentioned earlier, it takes 60 votes to waive the Budget Act and to overcome the Byrd Rule.

Under his presidency, the government saddled us all with a three-sizes-fits-all version of compulsory health care (which caused more than five million persons to lose their coverage and their doctors); it has been spying on all Americans all the time (and we sleepily permit it to do so); it allowed our ambassador in Libya to be murdered (after it destroyed the lawful government there); it told illegal aliens they need not worry about deportation (and thus encouraged the immigration of hundreds of thousands more -- even unaccompanied children -- to our shores); it neglected veterans to the point of death in government hospitals (demonstrating conclusively that the feds cannot deliver health care); it released assets material to terrorist organizations into the theater of war in the Middle East (ostensibly in a prisoner swap to save a weird military bird who once embraced his captors); it has claimed the power to kill Americans it views as a threat to others and yet too troublesome to arrest and bring to trial (all the while claiming it has a secret reading of the Constitution and American law that somehow justifies this); and it has added $6 trillion to government debt (with no plans to repay it).
That's a reference to Christie's prosecution of Kushner's father, Charles, while Christie was U.S. attorney for New Jersey in 2005.

We couldn't go into areas and look; we'd have to give massive notice. So, if they were doing something that they could clean them up, it was ridiculous. But most importantly, it expires. This is a short-term agreement. And now once it expired, they have an absolute clear, unstopped path of nuclear weapons. Unstopped. In a very short period of time, the deal that President Obama made with John Kerry, who may be the worst negotiator I've ever seen that deal expires and you know what?

It remains unclear whether Trump will make progress on building more sections of a border wall during his time in office, but he has seemingly acknowledged Mexico won't directly pay for the project (though the president still maintains that money resulting from a new trade pact with Mexico can still cover costs).

All I'm arguing is, we have some really important things to work on. You want to really kind of bring the country together and remember once again how we can get things done, it isn't by uniformity on all the issues, it's about working through a process that allows people with different points of view to debate all that and get to a solution for the country. All that -- we're just going to go -- we're going to jump right back into what we've been going through for the last five years and stirring it up again with a trial. And it's just going to be bad for the country. It really is.

[Ed. note: First: Go raibh maith agat! We love to hear from our readers overseas. Your observations are keen and useful, but I would tell you that good leaders do not produce virtuous people. It's the opposite. Virtuous people produce good leaders. America's lack of civic virtue is not the fault of bad leadership but rather the cause of it. And while I certainly agree with you about the value of travel for making one better understand and love their own country – certainly the case for me – the problem we face most acutely are people disconnected from their neighbors. It's certainly true that our hearts can be more lovingly inclined to our neighbors having seen the world beyond. But however we go about it, the urgent need for Americans is to find more and better ways to forge meaningful connections that transcend politics. Pints on us when you come to D.C.!]

WALLACE: Finally, I got about a minute left here, Doctor.
Along with that power, Biden also inherits the responsibility to restore peace and tranquility. In that context, his statement that impeachment is a matter for Congress to decide is a missed opportunity to prove he really does want national unity.

Budget reconciliation essentially robs the Senate of its two major features: unlimited debate and an unlimited amendment process. In other words, no filibuster. But, budget reconciliation can only be used on fiscal measures, such as tax policy. Obamacare qualified because it dealt with all sorts of taxation issues. Guns? Doubtful. Immigration? That's pushing it, although there could be tax and budget issues for new citizens. Statehood for DC? Maybe an outside chance because you are dealing with taxation and representation issues for 700,000 Americans. But that could be a stretch.

Here's one question: How exactly did Joe Biden win more votes than any other presidential candidate in the history of the United States? After 50 years of uninterrupted mediocrity in Washington and two spectacularly unsuccessful presidential campaigns in which he was rejected resolutely by Democratic primary voters, did Americans suddenly decide they wanted to be led by Joe Biden?
CRUZ: Well, that's right. It's kind of strange how we got here. So Democrats have been having hearings, have been doing impeachment for months in the House. They brought in all sorts of witnesses. They blocked the minority from having any witnesses. And then, as soon as we get to the Senate, the Democratic talking point is, we want more witnesses. Never mind all the witnesses they called before. They want yet more. And they're trying to delay this. They're trying to drag this out. They want this trial to go on forever, because they have a political objective of attacking the president. What I have said and what I have urged the conference is, is, listen, if we go down the road of witnesses, we're not going to do what the House did. We're not going to have a one-sided kangaroo court. Instead, we're going to respect reciprocity. What does that mean? That means, if the prosecution gets a witness, the defense gets a witness. If the prosecution gets two, the defense gets two. That means, if the prosecution gets to call John Bolton, then the president gets to call Hunter Biden. And I got to tell you, the Democrats are terrified about seeing a witness like Hunter Biden testify, because they don't want to hear evidence of actual corruption, of corruption, potentially, of Joe Biden, corruption that occurred during the Obama administration. They blocked all those witnesses in the House. They're not going to succeed in blocking them in the Senate.
COTTON: Yeah, it's really bad, Sean. And I can't think of another president who took office and consciously decided to eliminate American jobs. I mean, the Keystone pipeline alone generates more than 10,000 thousand high-paying blue-collar jobs.

Divided government isn't helping the deficit picture as the Democratic-controlled House led the way in repealing $377 billion worth of Obamacare tax hikes, including a so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost health plans.

So I'm -- I'm really hopeful that that is not going to be the case. But what you're commenting on is absolutely true, that we don't have as many doses as we would like now for states like New York, for other states that are see -- claiming to have run out of vaccine. And so right now is actually the pressure point that I'm feeling and by the end of March or so I really do hope that our production has scaled up dramatically and that we actually have way more supply than we do right now. WALLACE: Then there is distribution. The new White House COVID coordinator says what you inherited from the -- the Trump administration is much worse than any of you could have imagined. What is the distribution problem and how do you fix it? WALENSKY: You know, I would say one of the biggest problems right now is, I can't tell you how much vaccine we have. And if I can't tell it to you, then I can't tell it to the governors and I can't tell it to the state health officials. If they don't know how much vaccine they're getting, not just this week but next week and the week after, they can't plan. They can't figure out how many sites to roll out, they can't figure out how many vaccinators that they need and they can't figure out how many appointments to make for the public.

TRUMP: Honestly, he's going to spend money one way or the other. I mean, he doesn't have the personality for this. He doesn't -- he can't relate to people. He probably inherently dislikes people. So he just doesn't have the retail side of it, which is a big part of it. You can't -- he doesn't have a stage presence. He doesn't have that personality. So he will spend a lot of money, but what's he going to spend it against? And that's the reality.

It is far from clear how GM and the Obama administration could honestly say, much less trumpet in prime time television ads, that GM repaid its TARP loans in any meaningful way. The reality is that GM got additional TARP billions from a Treasury escrow account filled with taxpayer dollars. Taxpayers have not been paid back in full and are still on the hook for the TARP stock investment in GM. Whether taxpayer funds are ultimately recovered depends upon the administration's ability to sell GM stock at a profit some day. Of course, we all hope it works out that way, and it might. But, the American people deserve more than puffed-up press releases and misleading commercials claiming that GM paid its loans back to the government with money it earned. I recognize that one of the goals of the GM ad campaign is to build trust, but GM did it all wrong, apparently with some help from the administration. Shifting bailout money from GM debt to GM stock is not the same as repaying it. Stock is riskier than debt. Maybe it's a good idea. Maybe it's a step in the right direction, maybe not. Only time will tell. But, we should be clear with the American people about what happened here.
Seventy-three other people, including former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, received pardons from the president.
Polling has shown over time, that voters tend to support some, but not all, restrictions on abortion. In May, for example, Gallup found that 50 percent of voters thought abortion should be legal only under certain circumstances, as opposed to any circumstances (29 percent) or none (20 percent). That reflected Gallup's historical data as well. And while a plurality say abortion is immoral, moderates (55 percent) tend to identify as pro-choice.

McConnell may vote to convict - Axios: Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell will not consent to reconvening the Senate on Friday under emergency authorities, delaying the start of President Trump's likely impeachment trial until Jan. 19 at the earliest, McConnell's team confirmed to Axios. If the House votes to impeach Trump for incitement of the Capitol riot on Wednesday, as is expected, the trial will likely not take place until after President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20. McConnell's team informed Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer's office on Wednesday that McConnell would not consent to reconvening the Senate immediately under the 2004 emergency authorities. McConnell sent a note to Republican colleagues later Wednesday to say he has not made up his mind on impeachment: 'While the press has been full of speculation, I have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate.'

She had just shot a 'bigo buck,' she told him — a big old buck. 'Pretty happy about it,' she wrote. At first, Harrison figured it had to be a prank.

Warren has been asked for an explanation 17 times on the campaign trail, America's Newsroom host Sandra Smith noted, including at a debate last week. She has vowed to soon release a detailed plan and claimed that health care costs for Americans will go down dramatically, blunting any tax hikes.
SCOTT: Yes, let's get to the bottom of it. But, look, the bottom line is, we're going to do this.
ARROYO: Or that the best people are around the table who are experts in the field. We have got to go to the Olympic message of the president. You asked about the International Olympics Committee saying we don't want any political displays during these medal ceremonies. The president kind of dodged your answer dodged your question a little bit. But I like this idea. It allows us to come together, lets sports be a means of bringing people together. Don't divide people with your political messages. I would like to see in the United States, not only in the Olympics.

Gov. Ron DeSantis has issued an executive order stipulating that shots may be administered to residents and staff of long-term care facilities, followed by adults 65 and older. A portion of the weekly allocation of doses is set aside for long-term care facilities and health care workers, and the rest is delivered to hospitals and county health departments. Hundreds of older Floridians have been camping out overnight in frigid temperatures to reserve their share of the limited supply.

However, Democrats lost 13 seats in the Senate under Obama, while Republicans lost just one under Trump between 2017 and this year.
They seem to have hit dead ends with Roger Stone, Paul Manafort and General Michael Flynn. They can write a report condemning the president but the Russian collusion goods don't seem to exist. They may just keep on going, picking up new investigations from the Democratic House committees, and act as a permanent presidential investigation unit. But eventually I think the Supreme Court, which will start to get cases that could limit their power and authority, and the appointment of an unrecused attorney general, will catch up to them if they don't end it soon. Expect their report by March 15, 2019.

Gallup summed the situation up nicely: Rarely in the years that Gallup has tracked public ratings of the economy, since the early 1990s, have Americans had higher confidence in the economy than they do now. Obviously, with an election coming, this is bad news for Democrats. Even Gallup acknowledges that this greater confidence could serve as a boost to the reelection prospects of President Donald Trump.

From revving up the economy through tax cuts; increasing military spending; conducting tariff and trade wars with Beijing that roil global markets; and trimming commitments in places like Europe and the Middle East that irritate and outrage critics; Trump has taken an all-out we win, they lose approach to dealing with the China challenge, very similar to the approach our fortieth president used to win the Cold War.

Mitt Romney refers to unwavering support for a finance-based economy and an internationalist foreign policy as the mainstream Republican view. And he's right about that.

But also with a mandatory minimum wage of $15, even the government says that nearly million people lose their jobs.

The average citizen, on the other hand, just sees the GM CEO saying that GM has paid back the taxpayer in full.

More importantly, Cohen's allegations concerning the payoffs have some independent corroboration. Hush-money payments were made to Daniels and to another woman alleging an affair with Trump.

Now, before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. Study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. Maybe they should want to marry them, but they don't.

LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham, and this is the Ingraham Angle tonight from Washington. And do we have a show for you tonight? My exclusive interview with President Trump at the White House. It's been a wild week all around in Washington. Of course, the rest of the world. The President passed a monumental leadership test this week with flying colors. First, we had an Iranian missile attack in retaliation for the killing of terrorist mastermind Soleimani. Democrats of course predicted World War III would ensue. And as usual, the President proved them wrong. So, now hostilities aren't a deescalated state and Iran may and I underline may even come to the negotiating table. No one thought that was going to happen. Second, the President and the GOP held firm on impeachment. And boy, did that strategy pay off. After weeks of delay, Nancy Pelosi is finally caving, and she will transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate next week. Her plot to control the Senate trial has been completely foiled. Oops. Well, I had the great privilege of sitting down with the President for a wide-ranging interview today. He made news on all of these important topics and a lot more and he shared his plans for the New Year. Here's part one of my exclusive interview with President Trump.

If Biden follows the course laid out by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, social media censors, and his rabid supporters shrieking continuously against Trump and Republicans, it will only widen the political civil war we're waging. And it will guarantee Republican victories in elections for the House and Senate in 2022 and the White House in 2024.
BARTIROMO: I have got your letter in front of me. Tell us the crux.
Haley also blasted President-elect Joe Biden's plan for a nearly $2 trillion economic stimulus plan when he enters the White House next week.
Every time you bring this up, the critics of the president say, well, this has been looked at and looked at before.
All of that money that's going to Hillary and Jeb and Scott and Marco and all of them - the people that are putting up that money – it's like puppets, Trump said back then.
We augment and push out our events through social media messaging, and we have direct coordinators and influencers (with large followings) who help in letting our supporters know event times and locations, the source continued. The point was to be there for the president. All of these patriot groups wanted to be there. We don't want to see the theft of America or a banana republic.
Creating a commission on radical Islam: Trump said one of his first acts as president would be to establish a commission on radical Islam – which will include reformist voices in the Muslim community who will hopefully work with us. As of now, there is no such commission.

And when you put all that together, I think you're going to find a fake impeachment hoax.
There will be another opportunity to approve a standalone bill that sends money to the American people soon after Biden's inauguration. If Democratic Senate candidates Raphael Warnock and Joe Ossoff are in D.C., that will be possible. If Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue win on Tuesday, McConnell will block that desperately needed assistance.
WALLACE: All right. We asked you for questions for the panel and we got a lot of head scratching and reactions on Romney's criticism of President Trump. Mike Johnson sent this on FaceBook. When is he switching to the Democratic Party, because he obviously is no longer a Republican? And Jean Caragher tweeted this, is he positioning himself to challenge President Trump for the 2020 nomination?

In its founding ideals, as well as its current reality, America would be placed in jeopardy.
Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 gave the president power to impose some tariffs without Congress for national security reasons. Sections 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 had similar loopholes to expand the president's tariff power.

It has been one year since the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the U.S. and China continues to stonewall any credible investigation into the origins of this deadly pandemic. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization, which President Biden has praised, has shown itself to be, at best, incompetent and, at worst, a pawn of the Chinese Communist Party [CCP], Hawley said in a statement on Friday.
I think what they did was politically motivated, Cuomo said.
Steve Silverman, Pugh's lawyer, told Fox News he is hopeful that the President will give consideration to the former mayor's request.
OBAMA: And if it can change a state, it can change the nation.
Ocasio-Cortez joined in on presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren's criticism of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in November by saying he's a billionaire asking for a safe space amid Democrats' desire for economic disruption.
It is not a unifying message, and it is not doing the job we should be doing [in] fighting for working men and women in this country, said Cruz.
Best of all, they gave us more than 230 constitutionalist judges confirmed by the U.S. Senate, including three Supreme Court justices. President Trump deserves every bit of credit and praise for his pro-life legacy, and it will keep bearing fruit. The standard has been set for future pro-life administrations.
INGRAHAM: Would you be able to give her any advice for some of the rogue royals? What's happening there? It seems like there's a lot of tumult. And you've been so good at keeping your kids together in a close-knit family.
The hike, according to Murphy's office, would raise an estimated $494 million per year.
In terms of the rules, I think the president is entitled to due process. I think he's entitled to have a defense. I think he's entitled to present, you know, testimony and evidence if necessary and, you know, the House doesn't have much of a record of witnesses and so forth because they, frankly, rammed it through very quickly. So, I think, obviously, fairness is important no matter who it is we're talking about.

However, even liars can supply details of criminal conduct.

President Trump in 2017 signed a measure that slashed taxes across the board -- a move that was opposed by most Democrats.

The resignation brings to an end a decade in office for Rutte, although his party is expected to win the election, putting him first in line to begin talks to form the next government. If he succeeds in forming a new coalition, Rutte would most likely again become prime minister.

Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., recently announced that Democrats should increase the top personal income tax rates as high as 70 percent. That would be the highest income tax rate in the developed world, higher than all of our major trading partners and competitors.
According to the Gallup study, based on polling data, the percentage of Democrats identifying as liberal averaged 51 percent in 2018. That was up from 50 percent in 2017, but underscores a steady increase over the years. In 1994, only 25 percent identified as liberal and another 25 percent identified as conservative. Among Americans overall, conservatives outnumbered liberals by nine points, although that is down from 19 points in Gallup's first poll in 1992.

One grows weary of stating the obvious, but if President Bush had declared a specific category of citizen groups a threat to democracy potentially run by political operatives or foreign-controlled, and the IRS launched an unprecedented campaign of targeting and intrusive questioning, the mainstream media would have been relentless not only in its independent investigations but in its calls for accountability – at the highest levels.
Now, joining us, Texas Governor Greg Abbott. He's ordering the return of National Guard troops from Texas, and it's also slamming Biden's dangerous open borders amnesty agenda that will make us the united sanctuary states of America, writing, quote: President Biden is trying to halt deportations of illegal immigrants who already have a final order of removal, illegal aliens, but reading exact words, from the U.S. This abandons the obligation to enforce federal immigration laws. Texas is fighting this attempt to grant blanket amnesty.

BOGOTA, Colombia – The monumental, Nobel-winning 2016 peace agreement between the Colombian government and the Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels was saluted as a historic victory for international diplomacy – a declaration meant to end the civil war that had bloodied the nation for more than 50 years, claimed the lives of more than 200,000, and displaced more than seven million from their homes.

SANDERS: Well, they made some progress yesterday. The fact that they're sitting down at the table is some progress, in and of itself. But, they've got a long way to go. I mean, Democrats set down, the first thing that one of the individuals from the Democrats' side said in the meeting was, we're not here to make an agreement.
Yet President Obama has decided to usurp this power by unilateral directive, unconstrained by established checks and balances. In so doing, he is granting himself extra-constitutional authority and upsetting the carefully balanced separation of powers. He is also subverting the nucleus of our constitutional design: the rule of law.
And those attack ads you've seen against me? They're funded by drug and insurance companies and big banks, who have spent tens of millions of dollars smearing me as some kind of terrorist, socialist, Communist sympathizer.

And that's really the key behind a lot of the policies that Trump has introduced. And I think you just look around the Democratic side of things. We're going to learn more tonight. I mean, Mike Bloomberg alone on Wall Street, a major beneficiary of Wall Street, he was, and now he's got all these ideas that seemingly are going to take down Wall Street and penalize Wall Street for being as successful as it has been over the years.

Fox News: With President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration just one week away, his transition team is pressing the Senate to confirm his national security nominees ahead of the event, saying the country's security is 'at stake.' After Democrats were victorious in the Georgia Senate runoff elections earlier this month, the Biden team is making a heavy push for secretary of state nominee Anthony Blinken, homeland security secretary nominee Alejandro Mayorkas, director of national intelligence nominee Avril Haines and defense secretary nominee retired Gen. Lloyd Austin. 'Regardless of any developments, with our national security at stake, the pandemic costing thousands of lives every day, and our economy in a historic recession, there is absolutely no justification for Republicans to jeopardize the ability of the United States government to keep the American people safe, distribute vaccines, and put Americans back to work,' Biden transition spokesman Andrew Bates told Fox News.

But, until then, Democrats have a policy agenda to push. They've got a presidential policy agenda to stand up to. And they have an election to win. If they want to beat Donald Trump, the best way to do that, and have a mandate behind their own agenda, is to beat him at the ballot box. They've shown they can do that in 2018 and now they've got to do it in 2020. That should be where the energy of people like this remains focused.

In spite of people who are passionately pro-abortion, they recognize that it's an issue that divides our country and fundamentally it's one thing to use your own money to pay for an abortion, it's another thing to use your neighbor's money to pay for an abortion.

And I think it would be unjust to use taxpayer money for it.

That arrogance doesn't play well in Pennsylvania, and it doesn't work in most flyover states – like Michigan and Wisconsin, which Clinton did in fact fly right over in her 2016 campaign.

How does Ocasio-Cortez plan to pay for these massive programs? In a 60 Minutes interview with Anderson Cooper that will air on Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez suggested that some of her plans could be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy to rates as high as 70 percent. But even that huge tax increase wouldn't be nearly enough to pay for her numerous policy proposals, which is why Ocasio-Cortez has suggested the United States create a system of new publicly-owned banks that the government could use to run up the national debt. She has also called for printing money to pay for her socialist reforms.

The Writer's Almanac: On this day in 1968, country musician Johnny Cash recorded a live concert at Folsom Prison in California. Back in the early 1950s, while serving in the Air Force and stationed in Germany, Cash had seen a documentary on life inside the prison. This inspired him to write the song 'Folsom Prison Blues,' with its haunting lines, 'I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die.' He … began dreaming of some day playing the song live for the inmates there. … Released just four months after the concert, Live at Folsom Prison reached No. 1 on the country charts and was a huge pop crossover. Cash said: 'You build on failure. You use it as a steppingstone. Close the door on the past. You don't try to forget the mistakes, but you don't dwell on it. You don't let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space.'

Schumer could only do that by extinguishing the filibuster. But he lacks the votes to do so.

SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Just as we were led into Vietnam and Iraq by lies, the Trump administration is misleading us on Iran. They just did the assassination of Qasem Soleimani by claiming that he was planning imminent attacks and yet they produce no evidence that would justify this claim, not even in a classified setting.
Closed California versus open Florida, who is outperforming the other?
Bloomberg News reported the draft bill says, The lack of reciprocity in tariff levels and disproportionate use of non-tariff barriers by United States trading partners facilitates foreign imports, discourages United States exports, and puts United States producers, farmers, and workers at a competitive disadvantage. The draft continues that the trade imbalance contributes to the large and growing United States trade deficit in goods, which is a drag on economic growth and undermines economic prosperity.''

The new exemption, approved on a party-line vote (217-206), applies to the COVID-19 response and efforts to address climate change. More specifically, H. Res. 8 allows the Budget Committee Chair to exempt the budgetary effects of measures to prevent, prepare for, or respond to economic, environmental, or public health consequences resulting from climate change.
The stimulus would be a way to have an alternate message to the proposals from nearly every Democratic candidate looking to unseat Trump in the November election. Top-tier democrats are proposing massive increases in the size of government, with programs like Medicare for all, coupled with tax increases that will likely fall on the middle class.

It was a huge, productive, extraordinarily important 24 hours for President Trump and the deranged hate-Trump left. They are spinning out of control, beyond even my predictions.

Now, Joe Biden now supports -- to recap -- a presidential impeachment, divisive, no unity there. And, of course, the smear campaign that goes along with it as he only listens to the fringe socialist leftist policies he's hearing every day, adding D.C. as a state, ending the filibuster, using executive orders, bypassing Congress and other branch of government, enacting a radical pro-illegal immigration and amnesty policy, and his anti-energy green new deal agenda that will ultimately cost you trillions of dollars. Serious question.
So we could have this do over and that's fine with me. It can also be like when you're dating someone and maybe, you're thinking about marrying them, and then you see on America's Most Wanted that he is really an escaped prisoner from a year ago and you find that out before you get married.

The news of the progressives' appointment to the financial services committee was a win for progressive groups, who just last week voiced their disapproval when House Democratic leaders passed over Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib for membership on other powerful committees. The Steering and Policy Committee, chaired by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, formally assigns members to committees.
In the middle of a pandemic, while states are struggling to get their economies back on track and hard-working families and small businesses are suffering, it's not just thoughtless for President Biden to sign these heavy-handed executive orders — it's destructive.
Apart from Fox News, pretty much every major media outlet in the United States is beholden to Silicon Valley. Referrals from search engines and social media sites generate revenue that news organizations need to survive. So if you mess with Big Tech, you die.

Biden says he wants to unite the country but it seems more likely the vindictive left is determined to make Trump a martyr and further divide America into angry red and blue strongholds.

From the moment Donald Trump was declared the winner of the 2016 presidential election, Democrats have spun wild conspiracy theories about supposed collusion with Russian intelligence operatives. Hillary Clinton's campaign staff invented this fantasy to explain how they suffered the most embarrassing loss in American political history, and rogue senior law enforcement officials and career bureaucrats quickly latched onto the theory to justify disruptive, open-ended investigations intended to undermine the Trump administration.

The ball is now in the Democrats' court after the president made an offer yesterday, trading full funding for the border wall, $5.7 billion, in return for temporary protected status for the Dreamers and for refugees in this country, as well as reopening the shutdown. The disruption keeps growing after the standoff over the president's border wall reaches day 30 -- yes, we are into the fifth week of the shutdown.

It's like I was interviewed by a very, very good writer, reporter somebody that you know very well. I can say Bob Woodward. He said, he's doing something and this time, I said maybe I'll sit down, because nobody has done more than me. I mean nobody - if you look at three years with the economy, with regulations, with the tax cuts, with everything, and all the things, we've rebuilt our military. Our military was totally depleted. Our military was old and depleted. And he said you know you don't look like somebody who's under impeachment, as you know he's slightly covered Nixon and he covered Clinton. But Bob Woodward, he said, you actually look like you've won everything, you look happy. I said, I am happy. So maybe I'm wired a little bit different.

If Democratic Senate candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are elected on January 5th, the Democrats' impending socialist assault on our nation will make President Obama's first two years in office look moderate by comparison.

It is absolutely no coincidence, Neil, that that rally is scheduled to begin at exactly the same time the Democrats take the stage in Nevada. Mr. Trump knows better than anyone how to troll his opponents -- Neil.
I don't think killing the filibuster would be a very smart idea for Democrats. They -- they would seem to be making the mistake of thinking they'll be in control of the Senate indefinitely. And, of course, that is not the case. And you have some senators, Mark Kelly out in Arizona, Raphael Warnock in Georgia, that are going to be up in two years. And -- and so I -- you know, this -- this is still a very, obviously, closely divided Senate and I don't think they want to -- they want to jump off that bridge.

While the public school system claimed it only spent $12,073 per pupil in 2017, this number excludes the cost of buildings and other depreciable assets. A study noted that were these expenses to be included, the per-pupil cost would more than double the official figure. In other words, the lousy education that Los Angeles public schools provides actually costs taxpayers more than sending students to most private schools.

So if they overshoot it, then we have vaccine on the shelf. If they undershoot it, we have these queues and queues of people, people whose appointments are canceled. And, either way, we have challenges. So the fact that we don't know today, five days into this administration, and weeks into planning, how much vaccine we have just gives you a sense of the challenges we've been left with. WALLACE: One sign of the crunch that you're facing, at least in the short term, is that CDC put out guidelines this weekend that under, quote, exceptional circumstances you say that it would be OK to -- to mix doses, to use one vaccine for the first dose and the other vaccine, Moderna and Pfizer, for the second dose. And you also said, under these exceptional circumstances, instead of the three to four weeks that are recommended, that -- that patients could take the two doses as far as six weeks, the first dose from the second dose. But -- but, Dr. Walensky, you don't have any trials, clinical trials, you don't have any science to back that up. WALENSKY: I want to be very crystal clear here, those are not the recommendations of the CDC. The CDC recommends that you follow the FDA authorization, 21 days for Pfizer, 28 days for Moderna, and you stick to the same one. But the CDC is a place that people come to for guidance.

Biden has been pushing a third relief package that would include $1,400 checks for individuals, but a bipartisan group of senators balked at the size of Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal during a call with White House officials on Sunday, raising concerns that the measure provides too much money to high-income Americans.
Changing history means not just telling the same old tall tales of the free market system and the Founders. No, it's the history according to progressives.

It was the same message in Iowa last week and when I saw her in New Hampshire Saturday. Throughout her speech in the New Hampshire city of Manchester, you could hear people agreeing with her as she spoke and giving her a standing ovation when she finished – 600 people who are just starting to look for a candidate to support.
Senate Republicans would vote to convict Donald Trump and remove him --
It follows that divided government isn't good enough. In order for anything to be accomplished in Washington, and I mean anything, McConnell cannot remain in control.
We are bringing our troops home. The caliphate has crumbled and ISIS has been defeated.
Emotions are high now, but tempers must be cooled and calm restored, the president continued. We must get on with the business of America. My campaign rigorously pursued every legal avenue to contest the election results. My only goal was to ensure the integrity of the vote.
A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that adverse health effects include addiction, impacts on brain development, possible mental illness and impaired driving ability.
Pence insider says 25th Amendment decision not about defending Trump - Fox News: After breaking with his boss last week and certifying President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College victory over President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence this week quickly shot down a push by House Democrats urging him to invoke the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to remove Trump from the presidency. A veteran Republican consultant who's close to the Trump orbit tells Fox News that the decision by the vice president was less of a move to defend the president but rather of Pence doing 'what's right.' … Just as Pence last week resisted the president's repeated calls to upend the election results by refusing to accept the Electoral College results in a handful of states where Biden narrowly edged Trump, he also rejected the move by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and congressional Democrats to remove the president from office just a week before the end of his term by invoking the 25th Amendment. Pence said invoking the 25th Amendment is not 'in the best interest of our Nation or consistent with the Constitution.'
Fabricating evidence – submitting false and deceptive declarations to a federal judge – in an attempt to affect the outcome of pending litigation not only undermines the integrity of the judicial process, but it threatens the ability of our courts and our Government to ensure that justice is done, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a statement.
I believe the greatest threat to America comes from within — from the political civil war we are waging against each other. The right demonizes and distrusts the left, and the left does the same to the right. Republicans and Democrats, too, often go from treating each other as adversaries to treating each other as mortal enemies.

JOHN PAUL MAC ISAAC, COMPUTER REPAIR SHOP OWNER: I saw material of a very personal nature, I don't want to obviously go into it. I don't feel comfortable talking about the personal stuff.
If he continues in his role as Senate majority leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., would likely continue to show little desire to compromise with Democrats on most issues. This means much of Biden's agenda would be blocked, and the American people will continue to see a gridlocked government.
The problem is, (and I'll give you some numbers in just a moment) her entire basis - the economic basis - for this is nonsense is based on garbage talking points.
TRUMP: Yes, well, I have the right to do that. But people don't realize, I still have the tariffs, 25 percent tariffs on China on $250 billion worth of goods. I still have those. And by the way, remember, they used to say we pay for it. No, no. China devalued their currency and they pay for it. And we have a great relationship with China right now. So I don't want to speak badly of anyone, but they are having the worst year that they've had. The last year was the worst year they've had in 67, it was 57, now it's 67 years. And they wanted to make a deal, and we made a deal. And it's a great deal. Now we have a phase two deal which will start at some point, but phase one was very important for banking. You know what we did, we opened it up to banking, but for banking, for our farmers, for manufacturers, it's a great, it's a great --

And if they block that, what do you think are the chances that either on that legislation or something else that Senate Democrats will eventually decide, you know what, we're going to kill the filibuster and run the Senate on a one-vote majority?
The number of illegal border crossings is down from 1.6 million in 2000 to less than 400,000 last year. But the number of families coming over the border has risen sharply, putting a strain on health care and immigration services that came into sharp focus with the deaths of two migrant children in December. Administration figures show that 161,000 family units crossed the border in fiscal 2018, a remarkable 50 percent increase from the year before. Homeland Security officials have also said 60,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border last year, a 25 percent increase.

But make no mistake about it: Despite receiving widespread positive attention from many in the press, Ocasio-Cortez's radical left-wing policy proposals and her socialist ideology present a significant threat to America's economy and its longstanding commitment to individual liberty. Ocasio-Cortez doesn't simply want to tweak our existing system, she wants to complete Barack Obama's goal of fundamentally transforming the United States of America.
Proponents of Open Internet regulation believe the phone and cable companies are evil corporations who will rip-off customers and interfere with innovation and free speech. But they've been warning of impending doom now for over seven years, and just the opposite has happened—companies have done everything possible to compete with each other on price and quality, especially in the hyper-competitive wireless market.
And make no mistake, the two Democratic candidates — Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff — have no business representing any state in Congress. Despite the legacy media's attempts to bury any negative evidence of their checkered pasts, it's clear that both Warnock and Ossoff are wholly unqualified to be U.S. senators. Georgia voters would be right to reject their candidacies outright even if the balance of the Senate wasn't on the ballot.

I think what's going on here is that Cuomo, like so many on the left, is really worried. He's worried that the Supreme Court might reverse Roe, might send it all back to the states.

And by the way, if America's declining fertility rate continues, Andy, I have a question: Who's going pay all those taxes to support your pet projects?
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's, D-N.Y., Green New Deal is the most radical and destructive policy proposal offered by a member of Congress in decades. Not only would it destroy roughly 3.4 million jobs related to the fossil fuel industry by eliminating nearly all fossil fuel use by 2030, it would also require upgrades to every home and business building in the country and the creation of single-payer health care, a basic income program, and a federal jobs guarantee, among many other left-wing policies.

Consider his self-incriminating statements on immigration and executive powers. A year ago, when asked if he had the authority to end deportations of illegal aliens he said, Actually, I don't.

But that wasn't enough for Ocasio-Cortez, who appeared to want the latest checks to reach $2,000 as she and others have repeatedly requested. $2,000 means $2,000. $2,000 does not mean $1,400,″ she told the Post.

Other rule changes eliminate the supermajority requirement to pass federal income tax changes, and potentially avoid future showdowns over raising the debt ceiling by suspending the debt limit through September 30 of the budget year once the House adopts a budget. The so-called Gephardt rule had offered the House much less latitude, requiring an agreement between the House and Senate on a budget resolution in order to avoid a debt-ceiling vote.

Warren uses her family's struggles to discuss what working families confront today. Warren's mother's minimum wage job could save her family home from foreclosure. Not today. Why?

Report: Kushner stopped Trump from joining fringe social media sites - The Hill: Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, stopped Trump from joining fringe social media platforms Parler and Gab after he was banned from Twitter, according to a report from CNN. Kushner and deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino are said to have gone against other aides, such as personnel chief Johnny McEntee, to get Trump not to join other social media platforms, an outside adviser and an administration official told CNN. Trump has now been banned from most major social media platforms. His favorite social media platform, Twitter, suspended him Friday for peddling claims of election fraud.

And if this is such an important priority for the president, why didn't he do it at the beginning of the administration? He waited to the lame duck. Why? Because his defense secretary left with a strong rebuke of his foreign policy, his national security advisors sentencing hearing blowup because of the seriousness of the charges. His foundation was closed on for persistent illegalities. The gentleman heading the ISIS effort resigned.

Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi has said that unearthing Trump's personal tax returns would be one of the first things we'd do, calling it the easiest thing in the world to obtain them using statutory authority granted to congressional committees under the Internal Revenue Service code. Democrats made several efforts to obtain Trump's returns while in the minority, only to be rejected by House Republicans.

It would be disheartening and dangerous for our elected officials to remain locked in a partisan stalemate, given the enormity of the struggles facing the country and the dire need for bipartisan cooperation to bring an end to the coronavirus pandemic as quickly as possible, and to achieve real reform on the economy, health care, the environment, immigration and other issues.

And, you know, so everybody else sees it, but the worst part is, I would imagine Putin sees it, President Xi sees it, the mullahs in Iran see it, and Kim Jung-un sees it, and that creates a vulnerability. But I can't tell you how many people said what is going on with this guy?
Rep. John Yarmouth, D-Ky., the chairman of the powerful House Budget Committee, recently issued a request to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to conduct an analysis of the costs of transforming the United States' current health insurance system into a government-run, single-payer model – the plan embraced by Senators Cory Booker, D-N.J., Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and self-described socialist Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Yarmouth's request is a signal that Democrats are in the early stages of preparing for a future vote on single-payer legislation.

Today, the Democrats' only message is they won't spend one ten thousandth of the budget on a border wall. It is an appeal to the base, but is a weakening hand with a policeman killed in California and Democrats' statements that they won't compromise even $1. They have the chance to split the difference, make a deal for DACA and turn this into a win-win or let it drag on as a lose-lose. I think there will be a compromise sooner than later.

I think we shouldn't legitimize this (impeachment), Graham said. These actions, if they continue, will incite more violence. Every time you ask President Trump to calm his people down, to reject violence, he has done it. Now, how has he been met – I think by outrageous conduct by the Congress itself….To the American people, what good is going to come from impeaching President Trump when he's out of office?
It was definitely not a fair trial. In a fair trial that began in the House, the president would have had the opportunity to have his attorneys cross-examine the witnesses that were coming out against him.
But they're less relevant than we think. At some point, Donald Trump will be gone. The rest of us will be gone, too. The country will remain. What kind of country will be it be then? How do we want our grandchildren to live? These are the only questions that matter.
In 2021 alone, RIDOT will oversee $525 million in infrastructure projects, the spokesperson said.
Congressional reporters are used to this kind of treatment. Security officials hassle the press corps constantly. Stand behind that rope line. Don't point your camera there. Don't get too close to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., because you might give him coronavirus.

The president spoke to FOX News in Texas, on the banks of the Rio Grande, where he visited the border region to argue that a barrier would deter drug and human trafficking into the United States. Back in Washington, Democrats in the Senate on Thursday failed to proceed with House-passed spending bills that would fund the government and end the partial shutdown without new border-wall money.
Casey Mulligan of the University of Chicago and I estimate that at least 4 million jobs would be destroyed by the Biden bill because all of the free money makes work less essential and — in many cases — less financially attractive than getting off the couch and working. That's some stimulus.
More than 35 million people watched Trump's first-ever prime-time address Tuesday night from the Oval Office on the importance of border security, which was followed by a rebuttal from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

It's been 30 years since the court took on an issue without waiting for a federal appeals court to weigh in. Francisco says the justices should hear arguments in April or a special session in May.
So, this was the beginning of a conversation that still has I think a lot left to be worked out. They're going to meet again later this afternoon, and hopefully, they'll continue to make progress and continue to move the ball down the field.
Pair this with allegations raised by people who were hindered from testifying during the Senate impeachment trial and the president's actions – for which he was impeached on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress – are likely to be debated long after he leaves the White House.

What an arrogant, out-of-touch statement for a centimillionaire to say, Cruz shot back. You know, 'You little people, you know, I don't like the choices you're making, and so your jobs go away,' as John Kerry said right there. Quelle surprise that the Democratic elites have decided that blue-collar workers, that union members, that men and women with calluses on their hands, they've made the wrong choices, in John Kerry's words.
The illicit groups, outfitted with small arms, work with middlemen referred to as bag carriers to avoid detection. The carriers are ordered to work without a shirt to distinguish themselves from being militia members, and are forbidden to carry identification or a cell phone. They assist with crossing and take the cash, asking no questions. But in the shroud of absolute secrecy, the bag carriers says it's mostly the ELN, in cohorts with FARC dissidents with Venezuela safe haven, making the cross-border money.

But it seemed as if the guardrails of our democracy — Congress, the courts, the states, the media, the Cabinet — were keeping things within bounds. Then came the past 10 days. The country is now caught in the internal maelstrom that is the mind of Donald Trump. We are in the realm of the id. Chaos reigns. No guardrails can hold. – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on May 18, 2017.
BRAZILE: I think it's hard to get 17 Republicans. But, on the other hand, Mitch McConnell, when he took to the floor on January 19th, I was surprised by his comments. It's -- it's important that they hold this vote and hold the president -- the former president -- responsible.
In that one-year span, New York lost more than 48,000 residents, while Illinois' population declined by more than 45,000, the figures show.

The far-left advocacy group Justice Democrats had called for Ocasio-Cortez, as well as California Rep. Ro Khanna, to be seated on Ways and Means. Responding to the snub by the committee, Ocasio-Cortez spokesman Corbin Trent said that she hoped to be on it, but we're excited to see what committees she does get.

We sense the urgency of opening up the people's government so that they can be served by the agencies of government on which they rely, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters. The president has asked us to come down and meet tomorrow at 10:30. And we will do that. And we will have a discussion. Pelosi then interjected to remind Hoyer that the meeting was actually planned for 11:30 p.m. ET, and joked that Trump perhaps had told her the wrong time intentionally so that she would be absent.
In an interview with Anderson Cooper to air Sunday on CBS's 60 Minutes, Ocasio-Cortez said the huge government expansion could be paid for in part by taxpayers contributing their fair share. She said that, like in the 1960s, tax rates for those with incomes up to $75,000 could be as low as 10 or 15 percent, but much higher for those earning millions.
BAIER: As I mentioned at the top, Speaker Pelosi is running unopposed for
Other rule changes proposed by Pelosi and unveiled Sunday would eliminate the supermajority requirement to pass federal income tax changes, and make it easier to suspend the debt ceiling. The rules package also would remove term limits from committee chairmanships and establish a climate-change committee.
Trump has helped the few while hurting everyone else. He has partially shut down the government, hurting federal employees and millions more who rely on them economically. He dismantles our government and threatens our national security. He jeopardizes our economy with tax cuts for the one percent that has exploded the deficit to over $779 billion, coupled with a spending spree, in just two years.
He set his sights on Tallahassee and won a seat to the Florida House of Representatives, where he served two terms. Donalds had a chance again at Congress when Rep. Francis Rooney, R-Fla., announced he wouldn't seek reelection in 2020.
During the primaries, he released details about how he proposed to pay for his version of the Green New Deal, which he says would cost $16.3 trillion. That included $3.085 trillion from penalizing the fossil fuel industry for their pollution and from eliminating fossil fuel subsidies.

Progressive lawmakers are pushing for a sweeping Green New Deal in Congress – even garnering support among a growing number of Democrats considering a 2020 presidential bid.
Negotiations continued at the White House Friday. But apparently, they bore no fruit, because afterward, the president emerged to say the situation on our Southern border is so grave, he may be forced to build a wall without Congressional approval. Here's some of what was discussed when the president faced reporters:
And, look, that's really what's caused this problem, Maria. It's been the media. The legacy media in this country, they're not doing their jobs. This whole Russia hoax and Ukraine hoax, they were in on it from the very beginning. They have refused to talk about just how wrong the Democrats really were.
So I think people should be very wary of dismissing Trump as somebody who
But this was unique because it sparked a revolt at his own company; 5,000 Oracle employees signed a petition trying to stop this fund-raiser from happening, and several of them logged off and walked out of work today in protest -- Neil.
In light of the urgent humanitarian and security crisis on our border, the president is requesting $5.7 billion for physical barriers and border security, McConnell said. For some context, that is just about one tenth of one percent of federal spending. One tenth of one percent -- for physical barriers like the fences and barriers which already exist, which Democrats have previously voted for with enthusiasm.
And it's slow. It's not unusual we're talking about it. Again, this was

All right John, the media sees the sexy story of Trump versus Barr but they miss the fact that Barr was basically telling Trump, don't worry I got this.
Goldstone initiated the meeting, billing it to Trump Jr. as one to get dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, according to emails.

LANKSTON: There were tweets the wazoo, people saying, well done, they should lose their royal titles. They're no longer members of the royal family.
In the long run, when you focus on policies that help people, you implicitly expose that Trump has never done anything that doesn't help himself, added Ferguson, who served as a senior spokesman on the 2016 Clinton campaign.
Earlier this month, over the last-minute objections of Ocasio-Cortez and Khanna, House Democrats overwhelmingly approved most of a sweeping new rules package that effectively placed restrictions on some new spending. Progressive groups said the limitation would hinder them from realizing some of their more aggressive goals.

On Fox & Friends, Gingrich noted President Trump received a higher Black and Latino vote in the 2020 presidential election than in 2016 and that shift could play into who wins the Georgia races that will determine party control of the Senate this year.
But on Wednesday after weeks of mounting emotions, lawsuits to overturn the results, and an insistence from President Trump and his supporters that the election was stolen, the ceremonial duty became a jaw-dropping event pockmarked by a raid of the Capitol, shots ringing out, tear gas and lives lost.

—Total employment (peaking at 158,803,000 working Americans in December 2019) never was higher. Black and Hispanic unemployment sank to their lowest levels ever, with female unemployment the lowest since President Dwight Eisenhower. Median household income in 2019 hit a record $68,703 — up 6.8% from 2018. Wages grew a healthy 3.6% that year, even as the left's favorite adult toy, income inequality, slid for the second consecutive year under Trump, after rising under President Barack Obama.

The discussion of the Hunter Biden probe came after Joe Biden had told Late Show host Stephen Colbert that he thinks it is kind of foul play that an investigation into his son was used to get to me.

TRUMP: If you look at the Middle East right now, it's much tamer than it was when I got in. When I got in, it was just all over the place. Number one, we got rid of the caliphate, the ISIS caliphate. We have tens of thousands of ISIS prisoners. We've killed most of their fighters. We've gotten rid of ISIS. Now they come back and we take care of it. Other people should take care of it. Other countries should take care of it. Europe should take them back.
They don't take kindly to arrogant politicians who think they're better than them and singlehandedly insult and stereotype blocs of voters. Much like Hillary Clinton did in 2016 when she called Trump supporters a basketful of Deplorables.
For example, mandating a $15 federal minimum wage would wipe out small businesses hanging by a thread. It would cut into already contracted business income, forcing local retailers and restaurants to stop hiring and forget about reopening or expanding a small business. At worst, many may close their doors for good. A shuttered Main Street business diminishes economic vitality and means no jobs, no paychecks and no tax revenue.
The Democrat reform package includes an election reform section to fix something that isn't the problem. The bill argues we need to make it easier to vote, despite just witnessing record turnout in the 2018 midterm elections. According to CBS News, An estimated 113 million people participated in the 2018 midterm elections, making this the first midterm in history to exceed over 100 million votes. Furthermore, early reports are predicting more record turnout in 2020 with encouraging headlines such as, Expect Record Turnout in 2020. This begs the question; shouldn't the priority be ballot integrity, to ensure that only those persons eligible to vote actually get to vote?

Now, just to be clear. Let's say you made $11,000,000 -- you would pay a 30 percent tax rate on every dollar you made from zero to $10 million. You would only pay that 70 percent rate on a million bucks.
The same Madison whom Obama rejects warned 200 years ago against the Obama mindset: Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.
The entire foundation, the presumption of innocence has been void for this president the entire time he's been in office. It is the closest thing to a witch-hunt we have seen of a president in my lifetime.
The truth is that the banning of posts by President Trump is just the latest example of the steady efforts by social media companies and others on the left to silence conservative voices. The cancel culture has now created a new and unnerving phase of a societal purge for supposed wrongthink.

The converse is true for McConnell: he has the power in a 50-50 Senate, but none of the responsibility. Without question, McConnell may emerge as the most powerful Minority Leader in Senate history.
Harris's roots are in law enforcement, first as district attorney for San Francisco and then attorney general of California – the state's top cop. Carrying the banner of law enforcement for Democrats is akin to entering a Republican primary with a resume advocating tax hikes. Both positions fly in the face of party orthodoxy, particularly among activists who decide primaries.

If rural, more conservative areas see a large surge in turnout on Election Day, then that will be a key for Loeffler and Perdue to win. If the turnout among those groups is closer to that of urban areas, it will be a good sign for Ossoff and Warnock as they will likely lead in votes not cast on Election Day.
Where I am from, it is not typical to be a Black Republican because, for decades, the Democratic party has trapped our parents and their parents into this liberal groupthink, Johnson said.

I'm in Dublin Ireland by the way but have traveled extensively in America. Mostly off the beaten track on visits around the deep South for music and then Route 66 over several weeks… I was traveling in America in September 2016 and what I saw then convinced me Trump was going to take the presidency. The decline in prosperity right across middle America was appalling to see, poverty, abandoned towns, hollowed out communities and lack of interest from government to help, combined with Trumps campaign, plus the arrogance of Clinton could only have one result. And that's where you are today. Your point about a lack of civic education is valid but I think the problem goes a little deeper. A lot of people we met were out and out Republicans but were also very isolated. They never traveled, in a lot of cases never got much beyond their own county. They had no idea of the outside world, except the military people. And for them the outside world was Iraq or Afghanistan. I'm not saying they were stupid, far from it, but they were very open to the kind of crap that Trump has peddled. As the saying goes, all politics is local. … I don't know what the long term answer is but both sides of the divide need to start being honest with people. Civics and education is all very fine but people need proper honest leadership and this hasn't happened for a long time.

One week after her Senate colleague Elizabeth Warren began formally exploring a run for the White House, the California senator is stepping onto the 2020 stage herself, beginning with a book tour and a flurry of largely friendly broadcast media appearances in advance of her own expected presidential announcement. It's a chance for Harris to roll out her personal story while previewing the fundamental themes of her prospective campaign, drawn from her time as a career prosecutor and her ideas about reforming the criminal justice system. Harris will hit the morning news show circuit Tuesday with appearances on 'Good Morning America' and 'The View,' in addition to a National Public Radio interview. She'll promote her book Wednesday at a Washington event, then make a stop Thursday at 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.'
And so my send, it was funny, because as I tried to interview people, I realized that half the people there worked for Bloomberg. So one after the other, I work for Bloomberg, I work for Bloomberg.

Williamson: You ain't seen nothing yet - National Review: This is what happens when a relatively small group of federal workers don't get their paychecks. Imagine what it is going to look like when the Social Security checks stop coming. Around 2038, less than 20 years out, total spending on the major entitlements — Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid — plus interest on the debt will exceed all federal tax revenue. Put another way, come 2038, if we put every dollar Uncle Stupid collects in taxes toward Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest on the debt, all of that money combined will not cover those expenses. Fiscal Armageddon is coming.
President Trump signed the First Step Act criminal-reform bill, which freed some 3,100 such federal prisoners in fiscal year 2019. In FY 2021, expect another 8,700 similar returns to normal.

At the same time, I think there are some actions the president is taking that are going to lead to some anger and division.

Those people are going to be understandably angry.

TRUMP: If we're hearing from all of those witnesses, then I want to sort of hear it, because I realize, again, having watched this thing transpire over the last few years and the nonsense perpetuate itself, I definitely want to hear from the other side. If the Republicans -- and some of them, the, let's call it weaker Republicans -- I sort of like the Rand Paul model -- make them vote on it. If some of those guys don't want to hear from the witnesses that we'd want to hear from, but we will hear from the others, I want to know about it, because they don't deserve to be in office. So it really depends. We have to play the game the way the Democrats have played the game. We have to play hard, but fair. Hearing from everyone is totally fair. That's not what we have seen so far, while the Democrats have controlled the process. It's not been fair in any way, shape or form.

President Obama, most congressional Democrats and many congressional Republicans are ardent progressives. They view Congress as a general legislature with no limits to its powers -- and they mean no limits. For example, in an area clearly beyond congressional reach, such as in-state highway speed limits, the progressives found a way to extend their reach. They offered money to the states to repave their highways, with the condition that the states adhere to federally prescribed speed limits (only South Dakota declined). Once the courts gave their imprimatur to this assault on the Constitution, the feds realized that by spending taxpayer dollars -- by bribing the states -- they could extend their regulatory tentacles to any extra-constitutional area they chose.

SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MAJORITY LEADER: The fact is the House will deliver the articles of impeachment to the Senate, the Senate will conduct a trial of the impeachment of Donald Trump. It will be a full trial. It will be a fair trial but make no mistake -- there will be a trial but when that trial ends, senators will have to decide if they believe Donald John Trump incited the erection -- insurrection against the United States.
So, from my position, you know, I think that whatever that you want to call this impeachment show, number one, I don't think the Senate should validate this corrupt one-week process with no due process. Constitutionally -- I don't think it's constitutional, Senator. Then, of course, the argument will be --

Well, I think all options need to be on the table, Buttigieg said. As you know, the gas tax has not been increased since 1993, and it's never been pegged to inflation. And it's one of the reasons why the current state of the Highway Trust Fund is that there's more going out than coming in.

JORDAN: Yes. They were out to get the president. You had on Don Trump Jr. I thought it was a great interview. He said in impeachment started on Election Day. I actually think it started even sooner. I think it started on July 31, 2016, when they opened the Trump-Russia investigation, as I said, went and spied on four American citizens associated with the Trump campaign. And who was heading that investigation? Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, Peter Strzok, who said in one of those text messages, just went to a Southern Virginia Walmart. I can smell the Trump support. The disdain they have for the president and, just as importantly, the disdain they have for folks like you and me, Maria, who support the president, who voted for the president, that is what is so wrong. And then they get caught with these text messages. And now they're going to sue? This is ridiculous. The American people -- it's great that we -- those text messages were released, because the American can people can see the bias, the animus that these folks, who ran the two biggest investigations probably of our lifetime, the Clinton e-mail investigation and the Trump-Russia investigation, they can see the bias and the animus they had against President Donald Trump.

Sanders, the incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said in an appearance on CNN's State of the Union that unlike Republicans who used reconciliation to pass a tax cut bill and attempt to repeal Obamacare, Democrats will use 50 votes in the Senate, plus Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote, to pass legislation desperately needed by working families in this country right now.

With respect, congresswoman, I feel like the answer could be, if it's not an acceptable offer from the president, that's fine, the Democrats should counter offer with something as opposed to with nothing at all. Today in The Washington Post, the editorial board, which is not a right wing editorial board, they wrote, quote, Trump's offer should be welcomed, if not the final word, to refuse to even talk until the government reopens does no favors to sideline federal workers and contractors. And I think that's exactly right. The president has made his position very clear. He has now made an offer with a compromise on the table. And if Nancy Pelosi and her team profess to care so deeply about these workers, play ball. Come back with something.

During the 2018 midterm elections, the Democratic Socialists of America endorsed 42 candidates for local, state, and federal office across 20 states. Of those candidates, 24 won their primary campaigns, and 18 won in general elections. Millennials have largely cheered them on.

The Democrat campaign finance plan dusts off their decades-old dream for the public financing of political campaigns. This excessive spending could go a long way toward paying for a border wall and enhanced border security. Curiously, this bill appears not to directly address the large amounts of money being raised and spent by Super PACs that liberals complain about ad nauseam. Maybe that's because Democrats employ Super PACs to get their message out just as much as Republicans. According to a recent column in the Los Angeles Times, Among the top 25 super PACs in 2018 spending, through Dec. 3, contributions supporting Republicans and conservatives came to $341 million; contributions on the Democratic and liberal side totaled about $282 million.
When it comes to those with employer-provided health plans, a 2018 survey released by America's Health Insurance Plans shows 71 percent are satisfied with their current coverage. Why then would anyone advocate expanding a program headed for insolvency in 2026 according to the Medicare Board of Trustees, while simultaneously upending the employer provided plans that Americans like?
It is true that President Ronald Reagan utilized executive action in 1987 to grant a limited deportation reprieve to certain spouses and young children of immigrants. But his action was a logical and direct extension of, not a departure from, an existing amnesty law Congress had already passed. His exemption and a subsequent extension by his successor, President George H. W. Bush, were later incorporated into a new law passed by Congress. The point is instructive. The actions by Reagan and Bush are not a supporting precedent for Mr. Obama, but an important limiting principle of presidential authority.
I wonder whether any of the politicians in Washington understand one of the first rules of finance: debts have to be repaid.
Reconciliation provides a fast-track process to consider bills to implement the policy choices embodied in the annual congressional budget resolution.

TRUMP TWEET STORM TARGETS BEZOS, WARREN: Two longtime foes of President Trump - Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and potential 2020 challenger, Sen. Elizabeth Warren - felt his wrath on Twitter Sunday night ... The president coined a new nickname for the Amazon founder, Jeff Bozo, and praised the far more accurate National Enquirer reporting that revealed Bezos' alleged affair at the expense of Bezos' own outlet, The Washington Post. Bezos announced his divorce from wife MacKenzie Bezos last Wednesday, and news of the billionaire's relationship with former television anchor Lauren Sanchez broke soon afterward.

House MAGA caucus seeks to punish Cheney for vote - Fox News: Rep.

'I don't think she should be the chair of the Republican conference anymore,' Rep. Andy Biggs, the head of the House Freedom Caucus, told Fox News host Shannon Bream. 'The reality is she's not representing the conference; she's not representing the Republican ideals.' Another GOP congressman, Montana Rep. Matt Rosendale, also released a statement calling for Cheney to step down. 'When Representative Cheney came out for impeachment today, she failed to consult with the Conference, failed to abide by the spirit of the rules of the Republican Conference, and ignored the preferences of Republican voters,' Rosendale said in a statement.

But Bloomberg has also had to deal with problems he created for himself, such as stop-and-frisk. The anti-crime policy appeared to work for Bloomberg when he was a Republican, but now that he has converted to a Democrat he has been under pressure to atone for what many perceive was an inherently racist policy that too often victimized African-Americans.

I agree with your very cogent assessment of our educational system especially when it comes to the teaching of history and government in our public schools. I can remember the name of every one of my history teachers in high school, 'Coach.' It wasn't until I got to college that I was taught history by a Historian. Parents and teachers should know that it takes more than reading a single textbook that barely summarizes historical events to have a firm knowledge of our country's past, or the mechanisms of our complex system of government. Parents and Grandparents should demand that our children and grandchildren become literate in History and Civics. That will not happen unless Parents and Grandparents re-educate themselves and become literate in History and Civics so that intelligent discussions can take place in the home. I'd like to suggest that a reading list for everyone that starts with a copy of the Constitution and the Federalist Papers would be in order. – Ron Gay, College Station, Texas

New York has always been the critical, strategic and much-anticipated component of any U.S. online gambling agenda, and it represents one of the top three states in terms of economic potential, he said. It's no surprise that this is moving on the back of budget deficits in states like New York, and I think it's a great way of bringing tax dollars from offshore operations to the city and state coffers.
This is the kind of stuff that we seek to find out in a voir dire. This judge should be outraged not at anyone other than that juror.

Let's first look at some history. The personal income tax was imposed in 1913. The top tax rate on the very rich was 7 percent. We were all promised then that the new income tax was a tax on the rich. The one percent. In today's dollars that 7% rate only hit those earning more than $11 million (sounds like the plan Democrats like AOC are pushing.) But within a few years, the lowest rate went above 7 percent. Today the bottom rate is 10 percent -- higher than the punitive tax rate that was supposed to hit only the Kennedy and Rockefeller kids.

CRUZ: Hunter Biden had zero experience in oil and gas. It's not like he was a geologist or geophysicist. He was getting that money, the obvious inference is, because his daddy was vice president. And Joe Biden is on video at the Council of Foreign Relations bragging that he blocked a billion dollars in foreign loans and foreign aid to Ukraine until they fired the prosecutor who was potentially investigating Burisma, the company on which Hunter Biden sat on the board. When -- if the Biden family is profiting to the tunes of millions of dollars, the president is entirely justified to say, let's investigate and find out what happened. That's why Hunter Biden is such an important witness and why the Democrats don't want to focus on, what was the evidence of actual corruption? I expect to hear a lot from that -- from the White House defense team this week.

President Trump has rebuilt the federal judiciary by appointing judges committed to the true, original meaning of the Constitution, including two brilliant Supreme Court justices. He has renegotiated unfair trade deals, passed historic tax cuts, and cut unnecessary job-killing regulations, creating the strongest economy and the lowest unemployment rate in generations. Now, he is fighting to get the Washington establishment to give the American people the border wall they voted for in 2016.
CRUZ: So, I'm very worried. That testimony that you just showed is Dr. Robert Epstein, who's a very respected academic. He's a psychologist, used to be the editor of Psychology Today. And he did an empirical study on Google in 2016 and on the search results they came back -- and he was astonished by the results. He found that, based on manipulated search outcomes, biased search outcomes, that Google in 2016 shifted 2.6 million votes towards Hillary Clinton. Now, here's the interesting thing, Maria. Dr. Epstein is not a Republican. He is a liberal Democrat. He voted for Hillary Clinton. So, politically, he was happy to see more votes for Hillary. But he was horrified to see big tech have that kind of power. And he went on to testify what you just played, which is, if they do the same thing in 2020, which all indications are that they're going to, they could shift up to 15 million votes. It is terrifying that a handful of Silicon Valley billionaires that now control over $5 trillion of the American economy have no accountability and the ability to censor, to deceive and to manipulate votes.

CRUZ: Well, starting with the second part first, I do think what we have seen coming out of the House is an abuse of the Constitution. And the reason is that they're using this for political purposes. This is the first time in history any president is alleged -- has been impeached without the articles alleging any criminal conduct at all, without alleging any federal crime was violated. They don't allege any federal law was violated. They don't even allege as much as that the president has a speeding ticket, and that has never happened in our country's history. And to use impeachment, like the House Democrats are doing, to express their political disagreement with the president, to try to overturn an election they're unhappy with, that is an abuse of the Constitution. Now, the first question you asked about process and witnesses, let me tell you what we can -- what we can expect to see in the next week or two going forward. On Tuesday, when we come back, the Senate will convene at 1:00 p.m. And we will start with pretrial motions. We will start with probably battling motions. What I expect the Senate to do is adopt a scheduling order laying out the next couple of weeks. That scheduling order is modeled after the scheduling order for the Bill Clinton impeachment. It's very, very similar. So it provides that we start with the House managers getting 24 hours spread over two days to present their case. They can argue evidence.

There may come a time when this is a very relevant conversation and Bob Mueller will let everyone know when that time is.

VAN DREW: But I want her to know that we're all thinking about her. Secondly, to answer your question, look, the House had its time. They have spent months and months and months of reports, of investigations, millions upon millions of dollars. And we finally, the House, came up with two articles of impeachment, both of which are very weak. I will say this, and I will say it over and over again, because I think people must understand how important it is. Impeachment is a tool that is not meant to be used anywhere near a regular basis. Our founding fathers almost disliked it. It was said even by de Tocqueville, who was a famous Frenchman who loved America, that, when impeachment was used too often, that it was a sign of the degeneration of the country and the breakdown of the United States of America.

Braun, Manchin try to stop Congress from getting paid during shutdowns - Indianapolis Star: In his first act as a U.S. senator, Indiana Republican Mike Braun is expected to introduce a bipartisan bill that would prevent members of Congress — including himself — from being paid during government shutdowns. Currently, lawmakers are still paid when they are unable to pass spending bills by the deadline, while most federal workers are not. The latest partial government shutdown is now in its third week, as Democrats and President Donald Trump continue to clash over border security on the country's southern border. Trump has requested $5 billion for a border wall. Braun's bill, co-authored by West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin, would also prohibit retroactive pay for lawmakers.

The winner of the AL's top pitching honor in 2014 and 2017, Kluber threw just one inning last year for the Rangers, which traded for him the prior December, before going down with a Grade 2 tear of a small muscle in his right shoulder. In 2019, he made seven starts, totaling 35 ²/₃ innings, and tallied a 5.80 ERA. His seventh start ended when a line drive fractured his right arm, and his effort to return that season ended in August, when he suffered an abdominal injury during a minor league start.

SANDERS: Look, the president certainly doesn't want any of those things to happen. But you know what else he doesn't want to see happen? He never wants to make a phone call like the one he made earlier this week, where he spoke to Officer Singh of California's widow because an illegal immigrant came up off their border and killed him in cold blood. This shouldn't happen in this country, particularly when we have things that we know can help prevent it.

President Obama's decision that existing laws shall not be enforced against some 5 million illegal immigrants violates his sworn constitutional duty. Article II, Section 3 requires that the President shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. Nowhere is it written that the chief executive is granted the latitude to pick and choose which laws he wants to enforce. He cannot ignore or nullify laws he does not like because the constitution gives him no power not to execute laws. To infer such latitude would invite an authoritarian rule anathema to our founding fathers' vision. President Obama admitted as much when he said, The fact of the matter is, there are laws on the books that I have to enforce. He was specifically talking about immigration laws.

DONNA BRAZILE, FORMER DNC CHAIR AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first of all, I -- I agree with Jason, I think there is so much good in this $1.9 trillion package that the -- the country is -- is really anxious for. The fact that we are still behind on testing, we're behind on disturbing the vaccines. I mean if you look across the country today, before 8:00 in the morning, many states rollout there openings and then by 9:00 there's no way you can get a vaccine. So I think this -- this package will go a long way in healing some of the pain that we're feeling, the -- the people who are still struggling. And there are many businesses that did not get anything in the last two rounds. So this is a -- I think, a credible package.
Biden wants a massive plan that includes $20 billion to accelerate vaccine distribution, a $15-an-hour minimum wage increase, an extension of supplemental unemployment benefits through the end of September, a one-time $1,400 stimulus check, a temporary expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit and $350 billion in new funding for state and local governments.

At the foundation of all of Ocasio-Cortez's reforms is her commitment to socialism, an economic system that in its most utopian form aims to eliminate nearly all private property and puts the collective—which, in a democratic society, is simply the majority of voters—in charge of every aspect of life, including the education of your children, the extent of your rights to practice your religion, and your most important health care decisions.

Many dealers are traveling to Siberia to obtain the ivory after China banned the imports and the sale of elephant ivory. According to trade statistics, Russia exported 72 tons, with 80 percent of it going to China.
Federal workers on Friday are slated to miss their second full paycheck of the shutdown, which is now the longest in the nation's history. Republicans are hoping to put the ball back in Democrats' court with a concrete proposal, as public concerns mount about unpaid airport security officials, the processing of tax returns, and the issuance of federal food stamp benefits.
Stone received more than three years in prison. He'll be over 70 when he gets out. Officially his crime was lying about e-mails, e-mails that were themselves entirely harmless.
So, we have put measures in place at airports of entry, at land ports of entry and at maritime ports of entry. So, in the air environment, we're funneling flights from China to 11 airports. And that also includes any other individuals coming from any other country that have been in China in the last 14 days, to make sure that they get the right medical screening and the medical care that they need at those 11 airports.
Thanks to these triumphs, countless promises made and promises kept, and a parade of late-campaign rallies with at least 25,000 people each, Trump scored 74.2 million votes, the most for an incumbent president seeking reelection. He boosted his Black vote from 8% in 2016 to 12% last year — the most for a Republican since 1960. Among Black men, his numbers rose from 13 to 19%, and from 4 to 9% among Black women. His share of Hispanic votes rose from 29 to 32%.
So it's an ideological purge that's essentially a heresy code for Democrats. And they completely do not tolerate pro-life as part of the viewpoint within their party. That's a big shift.
CRANSTON: Enormous. Being cast as Tim Whatley on Seinfeld was like permission to go to comedy camp.
The roles would afford the rising far-left Democrats a powerful platform to pursue the sweeping reforms they campaigned on, even as some moderate liberals voiced concerns that intra-party clashes would be inevitable. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, has suggested that the nation's largest banks should be broken up, and she shunned corporate donations during her House run last year.
All we ask is to be treated fairly and in accordance with the science, Dene said in a written statement. Though the data shows we can operate outdoors safely, our state officials continue to shut us down while trusting big-box retail stores to operate in much riskier indoor settings.
That corruption is why Perdue voted to send vast sums to Wall Street during this pandemic, while for months and months he opposed the direct stimulus relief that both President Trump and Democrats demand today.
Biden has backed a preliminary study of the issue, as has Schumer. It is hard to imagine a more divisive proposal; race relations are at a low point. With Democrats pushing this kind of grievance agenda, they will only get worse.

Rather than taking that money and investing in actual technologies that would provide real border security, investigating in more Border Patrol agents, that, to me, seems like a better way to go.
The House has three formal modes of discipline for its members: reprimand, censure and expulsion. In the Senate, censures can also be referred to as condemnations or denouncements.

During a lengthy spat about Johnson's participation in the battle, Todd accused the Wisconsin senator of being the arsonist who started this fire about unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud. But Johnson pushed back, insisting the fire had started back in January 2017 as the left vehemently opposed the incoming Trump administration, which, he noted, eventually led to President Trump's impeachment.
By God's grace, I have received a pardon from Him, through Christ Jesus. I pray that I will receive the opportunity for Pardon/Clemency from the President of the United States as well, he wrote on the Free Kwame Project website, according to FOX 2 of Detroit.
Ocasio-Cortez had voted with Khanna to oppose the so-called pay-go rule included in the rules package, supported by Pelosi. That rule requires that any new mandatory spending for entitlements or tax cuts be offset by other separate revenue increases (such as tax hikes) or budget-cutting measures so that the new spending does not expand the federal deficit.

Just recently, Judge Leslie Abrams Gardner, sister of unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate and election rights activist Stacey Abrams, ruled in favor of Democrats who challenged the removal of nearly 4,000 people on Georgia voter rolls. Republicans wanted those folks tossed because change-of-address notifications indicate they have moved out of state. Presented with that documentation, local boards of elections voted to scrub those names, but they were overruled.

The agency also noted that new investments totaling $1.1 million for the state's Quonset Business Park made under Raimondo's leadership have yielded an expansion of 2,282 new jobs – a 22.8% increase. One out of every six jobs in Rhode Island is located at Quonset, which creates $4.27 billion in annual economic output.

In February 2016, Trump called Romney one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics after the politician called on the then presidential hopeful to release his tax returns.
Despite very low interest rates, the US economy is showing some signs of weakness, particularly in manufacturing and CEO confidence, Charles Myers, Chairman of Signum Global Advisors tells FOX Business. The White House preparing a package of fiscal stimulus is not surprising, therefore, as they don't want to take any chances heading into the November election.

Men like Madison, Jefferson and Adams were keenly aware of the tyranny and corruption of authority concentrated in too few hands. They knew the thirst for power posed an existential danger to those who cherish freedom. Their genius was in crafting a sustaining document that would end the arrogance of one man rule and protect the inherent rights of all men. They knew that absolute power corrupts.
In contrast, in the three years prior to Trump's term, manufacturing employment rose by 287,000 jobs.
The electoral college system for electing presidents is an essential part of our federalist system of government and was a key component to the passage of the Constitution in 1787. The electoral college enhances the power of voters in smaller states. Without the electoral college, voters in a handful of highly populated states would have significantly more power to determine the outcome of every presidential election, which is exactly what Democrats want. About three in 10 votes cast in the 2016 election occurred in just seven Democratic-leaning states: California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Virginia and Washington State.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, however, has taken a different approach. Though he did take similar measures to Newsom early on in the pandemic, he allowed bars and restaurants to open by June.

Earnings for the bottom 10 percent are rising faster than earnings for the top 10 percent, for the first time ever, Trump said. Since my election, the net worth for the bottom half of wage-earners has increased by 47 percent, three times faster than the increase for the top one-percent. Median household income is at an all-time high; for President Bush, in eight years it was $450. Under President Barack Hussein Obama, for eight years, it was $975. ... Under your favorite president, and when you include the tax cuts, the regulation cuts ... under President Trump, for three years, the number is almost $10,000 -- and it's going up.

As Democrats officially take back control of the House when the new Congress is seated Thursday, newly empowered House Committee chairmen are preparing to launch a slew of Trump administration investigations.
JORDAN: Yes. And one of them even -- one of the FBI agents even said they didn't think he was lying at the time. But they later then said that he -- that he did. Yes, they tried to set him up. They did set him up. But this is not unusual, because -- well, it should be unusual, but the FBI did it another time as well. They did it on January 6 at Trump Tower, when it was president-elect Trump. They went up there and briefed president-elect Trump on the dossier, the dossier they already knew was false. They went and briefed the president on it, so they could go then leak it to the press, and the press could write about it. And they tried to set up the president-elect of the United States in the same manner. So this is how they operate. And they got caught. Think about what Mr. Horowitz told us last month, Maria. He told us that the FBI, when they went to get the Carter Page warrant to spy on the Trump campaign, they lied to the court 17 times in the initial application and the three renewals; 17 times, they lied to the court. And now what's interesting, is Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, the two individuals who were in charge of that investigation, got in a little spat now with Rod Rosenstein, who was also involved.
TRUMP: Everybody - I don't want to say. But everybody knows about the whistleblower and they know about the whistleblower's lawyer. But then, do you remember, there was a second whistleblower. I want to know what happened to the second whistleblower. What happened to the informer? Remember that an informer. They all disappeared when I gave the transcript because I gave a transcript and that blew everything apart, because we have an accurate. And if the only thing covered by the hearings was that now people agree. Everybody. Even our great Lieutenant Colonel, please call him Lieutenant Colonel or great Lieutenant Colonel agrees that the transcript was accurate. I think he had one word different. We'll change the one word, it meant absolutely nothing. The transcript was professionally done by the best people there. Just one second. So, we have a transcript. They never thought I'd release it. They probably never thought I had it. I can only say thank goodness they had it because otherwise I would have been falsely accused and it would have been sadly my word against them. But we had other people on that call. Think of this. I was going to do something wrong on a call where I know there are many people listening.

De Blasio's announcement came after California's new Democratic Gov.

Sports betting revenue represents money remaining after sportsbooks pay off winning bets and other expenses.

Cohen is likely to try to portray himself now as a redemptive sinner – an act that is almost an affront to sin. For those who have long been critics of his infamous career (and the failure of the New York Bar to take action against him), the act will be as infuriating as it is unbelievable.

When I see Joe Biden talking to a group of 20 people with a teleprompter, because they're afraid of what he may say otherwise, that tells me all I need to know.

With the partial shutdown in its third week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she intends to begin passing individual bills to reopen agencies in the coming days, starting with the Treasury Department to ensure people receive their tax refunds. That effort is designed to squeeze Senate Republicans, some of whom are growing increasingly anxious about the extended shutdown.

Change history. Change traditions. But you can't just wipe them out, you need to replace it with something. And we are constantly being force-fed the progressive agenda through intentional propaganda:
Politicians like to misdirect your attention by talking about taxing the rich while they are enacting energy taxes that hit everyone who drives a car, heats their home or uses lights or air conditioning. And taxes on businesses are simply hidden taxes placed into the higher cost of everything we buy each day.
If this proves to be the case and Biden goes along to placate the far left, his own approval rating and that of the Democratic Party could drop to historic lows. If that gives Republicans majority control of both houses of Congress in the 2022 elections, Biden would face even more serious resistance from the GOP two years from now.

And the clearest way of all in which President Trump has delivered his populist promise, for exactly the people he prioritized: the manufacturing industry has boomed after suffering for years.

These are major policy changes, and I criticized Republicans for using reconciliation to give tax breaks to billions to create a situation where large profitable corporations now pay zero in federal income taxes. Yes, I did criticize them for that, Sanders said.

As part of the so-called Phase 1 deal, Trump scrapped his plan to impose tariffs on $160 billion in Chinese imports, and he halved his import taxes on an additional $110 billion worth. (The administration still maintains tariffs on $360 billion in Chinese products, and Beijing has imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports.) In return, China agreed to do more to protect intellectual property and to curb its practice of forcing foreign companies to hand over trade secrets as the price of admission to the Chinese market.

Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the committee's chairman, [i]n furtherance of my commitment to cooperate and provide the American people with answers.

But cost is just one issue. Medicare-for-all is mandatory, single-payer national health insurance. There is no opt-out provision, and there are no private health plans, as competition with the government would be illegal. It would replace the Medicare tailored exclusively for seniors with a one-size-fits-all plan that would even wipe out the current and popular Medicare Advantage plans, with enrollees responsible for 20 percent of the cost.

HARF: Well, in response to the first question, I think that's actually a problem the Republican Party has, that they -- that there are some member of the party, President Trump's base, that feels like there's not room in the public discourse for Republicans to criticize President Trump. And if that's the direction the party's going, they will, at some point, no longer be a true national party and they will be the party of the 30 percent Donald Trump base. So I think what will be interesting is what this Senate does as we get the Mueller report, as things get more difficult for the president.
The many court challenges against the Trump administration's bid to add a citizenship question, legal experts tell Fox News, face an uphill battle not only because conservatives now command a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court, but also because traditionally it's been the White House's prerogative to decide whether to inquire about citizenship on the census.

[Ed. note: It certainly does seem unfair that the individuals responsible for the shutdown are not among those affected by the shutdown itself. Shutdowns were introduced to our budgeting process as a bipartisan penalty for intransigence. Nobody is supposed to want a shutdown. But as our government has lost the capacity for budgeting and other normal fiscal duties, shutdowns have become a more significant part of our experience. That's because since the 1990s, parties have considered shutdowns as political opportunities. We score these events like games: Which team won and which team lost. The idea is that no one is supposed to win. A shutdown is an embarrassment and a reflection of governmental incompetence. What's obvious now is that those ideas carry less sting then they did 40 years ago when they were instituted. So maybe we need to, as you suggest, increase the pain.]

In truth, he is king of self-confutation, negating himself with his own words.

But I think that the challenge for the Democrats and the media is, there's very high likelihood that nothing's going to happen that leads to conviction. I mean as we discovered, you know, to impeach in the House is one thing, but then you've got to get a conviction in the Senate. And there is zero possibility that this Senate is going to convict.

Davidson: Absolutely. I think it was wrongly decided in the first place. And it's a shame it's taken this long for the court to correct it. And I think we'll look back, I think in history when science is more fully appreciated on life inside the womb, that we'll look back in future generations kind of like we look at the era of slavery and say, How did people tolerate that?
Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, the first Republican senator to say he would object to the Electoral College results, had his book canceled by publisher Simon & Schuster just five months before publication. The title is The Tyranny of Big Tech, so Hawley might want to add a chapter on the tyranny of woke publishers.
Even Ocasio-Cortez's branding of the Green New Deal as a kind of Marshall Plan that would be similar in scale to the mobilization efforts seen in World War II is eerily similar to an article McKibben authored for The New Republic in August 2016, titled A World at War.

[Ed. note: As you saw above, it will be the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate who rebut the president – something of an interesting choice. They might have put forward someone to make the Democratic case on immigration, but the two leaders doing it themselves suggests that we are more likely to hear a recitation of their prior talking points. I suspect the two side will be, as usual, talking past each other.]
HANNITY: When we come back, the deep states, wow, huge news. Day of reckoning on the horizon. Senator Lindsey Graham pushing forward with the FISA probe. We have an update, and I will show you exactly what happened earlier today. Yours truly showing up, that's me, at a Joe -- that guy right there hated my guts. He did not like me, turned his back on me. We'll show you the tape and more, straight ahead.
And I agree with your guest on one thing. Beat Trump, that is not a strategy. The reason that Joe Biden is falling and falling and falling in favor with the base is because they don't have an alternative to the policies that have proven to work so well. And I happen to believe that some of the black people who don't believe these low black unemployment numbers are simply victims of brainwashing by the news and the cable outlets that they watch. So no, I don't buy it. And there are some credible polls out there. Emerson is a credible poll, and Gallup is a credible poll, and they both came up with the same results.
The president's executive action to legalize illegals by nullifying existing law, constitutes a stunning abuse of office: usurping the power of Congress, while abdicating his duty to uphold and enforce the laws. Here are three ways this is happening:

We can also note that he has deep personal flaws. He is impatient, impulsive, self-centered, and at times irresponsible: this a serious flaw for a president who leads the world's largest superpower and whose every off-hand remark or impulse reverberates in world capitals, whether friends or foes.
Yet Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani issued a strong denial Friday afternoon calling the claims completely false.

WALLACE: I'll let you answer about the fencing answer. But -- but, I mean, here's the problem it seems to me. If the -- if Nancy Pelosi were to say tomorrow, all right, we're going to give you the money for the wall, she'd be thrown out as speaker. Her -- her House Democratic caucus would not stand for that. If the president were to say, you know what, I give up on the wall, his political base, that 39, 40 percent would turn on him.

Let's compare that to the president's rally in Manchester, basically another pivotal night of the Trump show all across the country. Thousands and thousands and thousands of supporters started lining up overnight in the rain and the snow -- and I'm here in New Hampshire, I can report to you, freezing weather, just to get a spot inside this massive arena.

We know that Americans overwhelmingly favor common ground limits on abortion. In 2019 alone, state lawmakers emboldened by President Trump enacted nearly 60 strong new pro-life laws, such as bans on discrimination abortions for Down syndrome.

Today's legal landscape is more favorable than ever to aggressively challenging Roe, with some promising cases working through the lower courts and more on the way.

Trump changes rules to let tax refunds flow during shutdown - WSJ: The Internal Revenue Service will pay tax refunds even though the agency is subject to the federal government shutdown, after the Trump administration reversed a longstanding policy. Monday's decision removes one of the biggest potential pains for many Americans from a prolonged shutdown. Even if the impasse over a border wall lasts into the income tax-filing season scheduled to start Jan. 28, the administration's move will let hundreds of billions of dollars flow to households. The administration is trying to make the shutdown as 'painless as possible consistent with the law,' Russell Vought, the acting director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, told reporters. 'We're going to continue to take steps like that to mitigate the impact,' Vice President Mike Pence said of the tax refunds.
In an op-ed for The Salt Lake Tribune in June 2018, Romney showed some appreciation for the president's policies, admitting his first year in office exceeded [his] expectations.

Meanwhile, in all the fanfare and patting themselves on the back, Treasury and GM made no mention of what happened to the $2.5 billion loan GM owes its union health care plan. The union loan carries a 9 percent interest rate and runs until 2017. Don't most Americans try to pay off their higher-interest debts first? Well, the union loan was not paid off. Why not? Does the union get to keep collecting 9 percent from GM until 2017, courtesy of the American taxpayer, while taxpayers give up a 7 percent return over the next five years in exchange for the hope that GM stock will be worth more than what we paid for it, someday down the road?

Beto O'Rourke is asking aides to create an itinerary for him to take a solo road trip outside of Texas where he would 'pop into places' such as community college campuses, as he considers whether to enter the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, according to a person familiar with the plans. Mr. O'Rourke's trip would begin from his El Paso home and keep him away from Iowa and other early-voting states. Mr. O'Rourke doesn't plan to be accompanied by staff or press, though he may document the trip on social media and allow people he meets to do so as well. He doesn't plan to make a final decision on a presidential bid until at least February. … Decisions to be made in coming weeks by former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, along with Mr. O'Rourke's move, will help shape the contours of the 2020 Democratic campaign.

WALLACE: I mean, in fairness, we heard Congressman Cicilline today say exactly that, and Jerry Nadler, who is the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, which is where this issue of impeachment, if it's going to come up, would come up, said the same thing this week.
Under his plan, the first $3.5 million worth of assets would be exempted, after which a 45 percent rate would be triggered. For those with assets worth between $10 million and $50 million, the rate would rise to 50 percent and to 55 percent for an estate valued between $50 million and $1 billion.
The timing of this maneuver also is troubling. The administration's so-called Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee, a TARP excise tax intended to recover TARP losses, was the subject of the Finance Committee hearing. The Office of Management and Budget, and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, estimate that overall taxpayer TARP losses will exceed $100 billion, and the auto companies will account for over 30 percent of that amount, more than $30 billion. So why does the president exclude the auto companies from his TARP excise tax proposal? I raised this issue at the hearing. I noted that GM refused to testify. The next day we learned that GM, with the permission of Treasury, withdrew billions from the TARP escrow fund and accelerated the repayment of the entire GM TARP loan. Immediately, GM and the administration launched a public relations campaign touting repayment.
BARTIROMO: We should have expected that Nancy Pelosi wanted the president out just from the State of the Union last year. She delayed it.
WALLACE: So let me ask you the same question I just asked Senator Romney, would you support ending this trial if you can on procedural grounds, that it's unconstitutional to try a president whose left office without ever getting to the issue of the guilt or innocence of Donald Trump?
Soon-to-be President Biden will find a unified Republican opposition to his party's more radical demands to eliminate private health insurance and fossil fuels and impose confiscatory tax increases. But Biden could find common ground with Republican populists on more mainstream ideas like infrastructure investment, confronting China over unfair trade policies, and protecting American families from rising health care bills.
This outcome poses hidden risks for Biden. It would embolden the far-left wing of the Democratic Party led by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and give them a clear path forward to push their agenda.
The rise of the far left in the Democratic Party has perhaps never been more evident than since Democrats recaptured the House of Representatives in the November 2018 midterm elections. The following are just some of the most socialistic and radical plans now garnering significant support among Democrats in Congress.

Despite the reported efforts in 2014 and 2015, Trump did not do well in either poll, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Online polls, unlike scientific ones conducted by pollsters, are notoriously unreliable.

So instead, they told us that the biggest thing happening on Jan. 4, 2020 was the impeachment of Donald Trump, and nothing was more important than removing him from office. Trump's crime, you may remember, was a 30-minute phone call with the president of Ukraine. In that call, Trump suggested there might be something corrupt about Joe Biden's son making $40,000 a month from a Ukrainian energy company, despite having no relevant work history in either Ukraine or the energy business.

President Trump signed this legislation into law on Dec. 22, 2017.

Members of our educated upper-middle-classes are now the backbone of the Democratic Party who usually describe themselves as fiscally responsible and socially moderate. In other words, functionally libertarian. They don't care how you live, as long as the bills are paid and the markets function.

I think making sure that people remember that they were elected to get something done and passed legislation is the most important thing.

Out of 500 footnotes in the Horowitz report, there is four of them that they say once it's declassified and made public will show that they contradict the assumptions made in Horowitz's report, basically on the Crossfire Hurricane when that investigation began. Remember, the FBI claims that they began the investigation July 31st.
CORKE: From the Situation Room, Rose Garden, briefing and cabinet rooms, and this weekend, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, President Trump carefully crafted a forward leaning posture during the shutdown this week but for all the crime statistics and letters to Congress imploring lawmakers to fund border security including the wall, an ominous realization has a cast a pall over the nation's capital, with no sign of movement in the negotiations, a partial government shutdown is unlikely to end anytime soon.
Add to the mix a Congress that barely functions, problems that don't get solved, and experts, including a biased media, that accepted the false Trump-Russia collusion charges made by Democrats. It's no wonder the public was open to an outsider who threatened to disrupt the government.

Many Democrats have abandoned that truth. They have replaced it with socialism — the opposite of capitalism and economic freedom. Their economic agenda is based on the idea of control. It means more government power, more corporate bailouts, more bailouts for dysfunctional state governments, more lockdowns and less freedom. That is the essence of socialism.
When Washington radicals ban drilling on federal lands, Americans lose their jobs, investment flows overseas, and communities across America lose a primary source of revenue for schools, health care, and conservation efforts.
Meanwhile, the effects are the partial government shutdown are beginning to manifest. Trump is expected to sign legislation this week authorizing back pay for 800,000 federal workers who either have been idled or are working without pay during the shutdown. He is expected to address the American Farm Bureau on Monday. Farmers have supported Trump through a trade war with China, but some are complaining about the loss of loans, payments and other agricultural services because of the shutdown.
What could have been a disaster for his administration and threatened to throw the economy into a downward spiral, ultimately ended up as a win for Trump. After 18 months of trade combat, the U.S. and China agreed to an interim truce in their trade war.

Still, people with direct knowledge of the matter say the White House will likely want to showcase a tax-cut proposal — particularly one that targets the middle class — as a way of contrasting the fiscal policies advocated by most Democrats looking to oust President Trump.

President Biden's first 100 days are sure to look different than those of Democrats past, and not just due to the unprecedented challenge of a pandemic. Economic challenge was met by greater spending under Barack Obama than by his Democratic predecessor, Bill Clinton, and even more federal largesse will be doled out by Biden if Congress gives him his way. Other priorities have differed too.
In similar fashion, the Post says Trump is furious with the greatest loyalist outside his immediate family, Mike Pence, for refusing to block the Electoral College certification, which the vice president has no power to do.
At his confirmation hearing, Garland should be asked about his view of law enforcement, federal anti-discrimination laws, and a host of other issues.

My problem with the package has to do with some of the things I think will be harmful, actually. I mean take the $15 federal minimum wage proposal, Chris. You know, restaurants have been one of the hardest hit industries over the past year and they rely on a lot of low skill workers. And a $15 minimum wage will make it more difficult for them to find workers because these low skill workers will be priced out of -- out of the labor force. So I don't think something like that is helpful. Or extending unemployment benefits -- or supplementing unemployment benefits that discourage people from returning -- returning to work because they're being paid more to stay home. So -- so some of this I don't think deserves to pass, but some of it should and some of it I think will.

His deft handling of their criticism allowed him to upend the American political landscape and win the greatest election upset in presidential history.
The executive order is one of a number of immigration policies that have been put on ice by the courts.

And she has proposed creating multiple other trillion-dollar government programs, like a federal jobs guarantee that would pay anyone who wants a government job a living wage and other basic income programs, which are designed to pay lower-income and non-working people money, even if they are able-bodied and could work.

Bloomberg: Tom Steyer, the billionaire Democratic activist who has made impeaching President Donald Trump one of his signature issues, said he will announce his 'political plans for 2019 and beyond' Wednesday in Iowa, site of the first presidential nominating contest. The statement does not include details of what the announcement will be, including if he'll launch a presidential campaign or exploratory committee, but adds he will take questions from the media 'regarding his plans for the future and his vision for the country.' The event begins 4:30pm Washington time in Des Moines.

Yes, we have to go faster. We are limited by numerous constraints here. The first is the supply, and we're working closely with the manufacturers so that that does not become a constraint. We also need to sort of make sure that this -- the supply gets to pharmacies, that we have enough vaccinators, that we have enough places and outreach to do the vaccinations. So, yes, I think that the supply is probably going to be the most limiting constraint early on and we're really hoping that after that first 100 days we'll have much more production, not just for these two vaccines, but we are hopeful that we'll have another one from Johnson & Johnson in the weeks ahead and perhaps even a fourth coming down the pipeline. So -- so we are really hoping that we'll have more vaccines and that will increase the pace at which we can do the vaccinations. WALLACE: I want to get to those supply concerns in a moment. But let's talk about the stakes first. We are already seeing variants of -- of the virus from the U.K., from Brazil, from South Africa that we're being told are more readily transmissible, are deadlier and more resistant to the virus.

And I think that this is a part of continuing moving in the direction of getting him engaged into the modern world. And I think --
While we defend our federal gains and work diligently to win back the House and Senate, pro-life advocates should go on offense in the states.

Nadler described it in the context of House Democrats' quest to get Trump's tax returns, calling it a workaround to a White House that continues to obstruct and stonewall the legitimate oversight work of Congress.

JORDAN: Yes. No, I mean, look, they never expected him to do this. One of the great moves the president made is actually release the call transcript. The transcript itself shows no quid pro quo. The two individuals on the call, President Trump and President Zelensky, have repeatedly said there was no pressure, no pushing, no linkage of any type of investigation to the security assistance dollars. Third point, there Ukrainians didn't even know at the time of the call that the aid was on hold, that the aid have been paused. They didn't learn until about a month later from the Politico article. And the most important fact -- and this is one that the Democrats can never get past -- the most important fact is, the Ukrainians took no action, i.e., no announcement, no promise to start, no investigation, no announcement whatsoever about doing an investigation into the Bidens or Burisma to get the aid released. The aid was released because, over that pause time, that 55 days when the aid was paused, the president became convinced that Zelensky was a genuine reformer, and he decided to go ahead and release the hard-earned tax dollars of the American people to Ukraine.

WILL BOTH SIDES RETURN TO THE BARGAINING TABLE? - Congress is set to return Monday for its first full week of work since Democrats assumed control of the House and neither President Trump nor Democratic lawmakers show signs of relenting in the battle over the border wall at the center of the partial government shutdown ... In an interview with FOX News Sunday host Chris Wallace, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., recommended that President Trump open the government for a period of time - perhaps three weeks - while resuming negotiations and trying to reach a deal with Democrats. If Democrats still refuse to compromise on a deal after three weeks, Graham said, Trump should resort to emergency options to get funding for the border wall.
In November, Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the Trump real estate project in Russia as part of Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates in the 2016 presidential election.
Trump's memo directed the State Department to extend this to all federal departments and agencies. According to a 2020 State Department report, only eight out of 1,340 prime awardees who received funding between May 2017 and September 2018 declined to adhere to the expanded policy.

NY Post: Hundreds of National Guard troops have been forced to sleep in the hallways of the Capitol — believed to be the first time troops have camped there since the Civil War. Images from Wednesday morning show the battle-ready guards sleeping in almost any spot they can find — many with their assault rifles propped up nearby. The troops had slept there overnight after getting the call at 6 p.m. Tuesday — with at least 20,000 National Guardsmen now expected in Washington, DC, amid an alarming surge in threats of violent revolts against next Wednesday's inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. They were still sprawled on floors — some using stairs for makeshift pillows — when the House convened just after 9 a.m. In surreal images, lawmakers were forced to step over the slumped bodies of their guardians as they arrived for the hearings on impeaching President Trump for the very riots that sparked the troops' presence.

Although the Green New Deal has received huge amounts of media attention in recent weeks – both positive and negative – the radical origins of the plan have not. Ocasio-Cortez has been labeled an innovative thinker for offering the allegedly visionary Green New Deal, but the truth is that most of these ideas have been floating around socialist circles since at least the early 2000s, and there is strong evidence to suggest that much of the draft text of Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal is merely a revised version of the Leap Manifesto, a socialist green-energy plan pushed by far-left environmentalists in Canada.

They can argue law and argue whatever they want. After that, the president and the White House, they get 24 hours spread over two days to present their case. Then we shift questions from senators. Senators get 16 hours. Our questions have to be in writing, and the chief justice asks them for us. All of that, I would anticipate, takes about a week -- a week to a week-and-a-half. At that point, what the scheduling order provides is, the Senate is going to vote on whether or not additional witnesses are necessary. That's a 51- vote threshold. I don't know how that vote is going to come out. I think all 47 Democrats will vote yes. The open question is whether there will be four Republicans to join with those 47 Democrats. And, look, I think some of that depends on what happens in the first week- and-a-half, what arguments the House managers put forward, what arguments the White House puts forward, what questions comes out.

JASON CHAFFETZ, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I wish I could have that magic ball to tell you exactly what it is, and I hope it's sooner rather than later. But I think the Democrats have really put themselves in a tough box because the president is on the side of national security, protecting our border and doing what the federal employees, the Border Patrol, wants to do. They had 60,000 people they apprehended in November coming across the border. And when the Border Patrol goes out and says, we have to have some sort of impediment, something that will slow them down, some sort of wall or barrier, where we've done it in the past it work, that's a compelling argument.

THE LEAD STORY – THE WALL BETWEEN TRUMP AND PELOSI: Newly empowered House Democrats late Thursday passed a bill to reopen the government without funding President Trump's border wall ... In a news conference Thursday night, newly-elected House Speaker Nancy Pelosi broadly discussed the ongoing partial government shutdown, which has dragged on since Dec. 22. Even as she said she would be willing to fund border security, Pelosi called a border wall a symptom of an old way of thinking and promised not to fund it. We're not doing a wall. Does anyone have any doubt that we're not doing a wall? Pelosi told reporters.

Biden's COVID-19 proposal also includes a provision to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, vaccine funding, money for schools and state and local governments -- priorities that may not fit into budget reconciliation rules. Democrats may be required to pick up GOP votes or compromise for a smaller package that has bipartisan support.
The first is, this has started big. You know, 30 executive orders in two and a half days, I mean that's not -- that's not sleepy Joe Biden.

We should have had 8 [percent] or 10 percent growth.
Could Cory Booker be getting wifed up? - Page Six: Cory Booker and Rosario Dawson seem to be moving fast. Just on Sunday, The Post's Richard Johnson reported that the New Jersey senator and the movie star had been spotted together catching a movie at the Regal Union Square on Thursday. Now Page Six is told that Dawson was heard saying — or, more specifically, singing — 'I love you' to Booker. Spies at Saturday's performance of Broadway hit 'Dear Evan Hanson' say they were left in no doubt that Booker and Dawson — who brought Dawson's daughter and Booker's niece to see the show — are a couple. And after meeting the cast post-show, Dawson — who was walking across the empty stage on her way to the exit — began fooling around and singing a made-up song to Booker that went, 'I love you; te amo [as in, the Spanish for 'I love you'].' … While the source said that they didn't kiss while they were there, they said it was clear that they're an item.

But it's even worse than just being slandered with lame sex jokes. Millions of Americans united in a belief that government is out of control and needs to scale back the spending, the corruption, the special interests and who are publicly demonstrating their frustration at health care town halls, on tax day and on 9/12, they aren't being mocked anymore. They are being completely ignored. You don't even exist.

The graph shows the average unemployment rate in the first 35 months of each president's first term going back five decades.
CHAFFETZ: I think that's the big threat. I think that's the mixed message.
In a December surprise, General James Mattis quit over the Syrian troop withdrawal. Not since President Harry Truman fired the revered General Douglas MacArthur has a president had to contend with a general opposing civilian rule in such a bold manner. But the decision to draw down 2,000 troops was hardly a momentous military decision in the leagues of sending hundreds of thousands of troops to Korea, the decision to start the Iraq war or to use the atomic bomb against Japan. It was more likely a pretext to leave the administration and surely there will be a multimillion-dollar book contract next. Military command moves on, and this is just another failed power play.

However, the problem with wrecking balls is that unless they are controlled by a skilled operator, they can swing backward and harm the person controlling them.

Need evidence? Look no further than the drama over the COVID-19 stimulus package wherein 78% of Americans support $2,000 stimulus checks and the GOP still blocked it.

In an address to the nation from the White House on Saturday, the president proposed a reasonable good-faith compromise to Democrats to protect 1 million immigrants from deportation for three years in exchange for $5.7 billion in funding for the border barrier needed for our national security.

It's also true that many of Donald Trump's populist promises have been delivered. The top of the list, of course, is jobs and the economy. The poverty rate is at its lowest point in a decade -- not by accident, but because of actual policy, like deregulation and tax cuts.
While there may appear to be storm clouds on the horizon that he will have to deal with in the coming months – namely a recent slowing of economic growth and a continually growing national deficit -- Trump is still expecting to have the economy rolling as he heads in the election year.

Liberal lawyers have scoured the country for the most anti-Trump judges, and thus far have succeeded in getting those judges to thwart President Trump's travel ban, his zero tolerance policy on illegal immigration, his revocation of President Obama's blatantly unconstitutional DACA order, and his Justice Department's refusal to give sanctuary cities money that Congress specifically withheld from them. Most recently, an activist judge even issued an injunction against something as basic as restoring a question on the U.S. census form.

Shutdown stories: Florida prison guards pay the price - NYT: A federal prison here in Florida's rural Panhandle lost much of its roof and fence during Hurricane Michael in October, forcing hundreds of inmates to relocate to a facility in Yazoo City, Miss., more than 400 miles away. Since then, corrections officers have had to commute there to work, a seven-hour drive, for two-week stints. As of this week, thanks to the partial federal government shutdown, they will be doing it without pay — no paychecks and no reimbursement for gas, meals and laundry, expenses that can run hundreds of dollars per trip. 'You add a hurricane, and it's just too much,' said Mike Vinzant, a 32-year-old guard and the president of the local prison officers' union.

And you're absolutely right, what this tells us is that we need to get more vaccine out there and that people really, when they have -- are offered the vaccine, have the opportunity to roll up their sleeves and take it. WALLACE: But -- but is that fair to call it a race against time? To -- to make sure that -- that you vaccinate people before we get a strain that the vaccine won't work on? WALENSKY: I would say we've been in a race all along. The more virus that is out there, the more virus that is replicating, the more likely that we are going to have mutations and variants. So not only do we need to vaccinate, but we need for people to wear masks, we need all of these other mitigation strategies so that we can decrease the amount of virus that is circulating and, therefore, decrease the amount of variants that are out there.

Trump expanded the definition of the deserving poor to include everyday working families whose wages had stagnated for years.

This is an entirely partisan and, therefore, illegitimate effort by House Democrats to remove a president from office. And the remedy for that is the United States Senate, as envisioned by the framers of the Constitution. In order to overturn the will of the electorate in the 2016 election, and particularly given the fact that we are now in the middle of a presidential campaign for 2020, ultimately, that will can only be overturned with a bipartisan effort and overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate, with a two-thirds majority, in order to remove a president and overturn the will of that electorate. It's very simple.

The Democratic investigations and impeachment mantras are starting up. Depending upon what is in his tax returns, Trump will release them and laugh or fight it all the way to the Supreme Court. Most of the Congressional subpoenas will be ignored and slow-walked. No doubt an impeachment would be a crowd pleaser for the Democratic base and Trump could face some manic days with the release of the Mueller report, just as Bill Clinton faced tough days after Ken Starr released his report.
