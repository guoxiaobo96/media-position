One of the most powerful Democratic City Council members in Chicago has been charged with extortion, accused of trying to shake down a fast-food restaurant seeking remodeling permits, said a federal complaint unsealed Thursday.\n\nAlderman Ed Burke, 75, is charged with one count of attempted extortion for conveying to company executives of a Burger King in 2017 that they'd get the permits if they signed on as clients at his private property tax law firm, the 37-page complaint said.\n\nA conviction carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBurke made an initial appearance on Thursday in U.S. District Court in Chicago. A preliminary hearing is set for the afternoon of Jan 18.\n\nThe Democrat's law firm, Klafter & Burke, represented the high-rise tower that bears President Trump's name. There's no indication the case is at all tied to his firm's work for Trump.\n\nKlafter & Burke specializes in property tax appeals, and its former clients included Trump's luxury tower in downtown Chicago.\n\nNewly elected Rep. Jesus Chuy Garcia and other Burke critics in Chicago's Hispanic community have drawn attention to that tax work in a bid to hurt Burke politically.\n\nBurke joins a long list of Chicago lawmakers charged criminally, including former Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who is serving a 14-year prison term on multiple federal corruption convictions.\n\nBurke has been on the council in Chicago for 50 years and has chaired its finance committee for the last three decades, Fox 32 reported.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune added that Mayor Rahm Emanuel has said it's unacceptable for Burke to continue in his role as chairman of the finance committee; a vote to force him out may take place at the City Council's next meeting Jan. 23.\n\nBurke's wife, Anne, is an Illinois Supreme Court justice. His father also was influential in Democratic circles in Chicago until his death in the 1960s. Other Burke relatives also have been involved in Illinois politics.\n\nSince the 1970s, nearly three dozen aldermen have been convicted. A common joke in Chicago is that so many aldermen had gone to prison that when they saw each other behind bars they'd holler, Quorum call!\n\nBurke is associated by Chicagoans with insider benefits long accorded alderman. A city inspectors report in 2016 found snow removal crews plowed the street where he lived far more often than other streets after a 2015 storm. They worked his street 46 times in five days, the report said.\n\nCHICAGO REDUCES MURDER RATE IN 2018 BUT STILL OUSTRIPS LOS ANGELES AND NEW YORK COMBINED\n\nBurke said after FBI raids on his offices at City Hall and in his Southwest Side ward in November that he was sure agents wouldn't find anything amiss.\n\nThe complaint, which did not identify the fast-food company or the executives allegedly squeezed, included excerpts from wiretaps of Burke's phone and emails seized in the raids.\n\nWhen the executives didn't give Burke's law firm the business he wanted, Burke spoke with one of his ward employees about how they would play hard ball with the company, the complaint said.\n\nFox News' Jim Murphy and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
House Democrats are working on legislation that would permanently expand the child tax credit to provide thousands per year per child to tens of millions of Americans in the form of monthly recurring payments.\n\nUnder the American Family Act, tax credits would be fully refundable and the IRS would send $300 monthly checks for families with a child under 6 and $250 payments for children between 6 and 17. That would amount to $3,600 per year for children under 6 and $3,000 for older children.\n\nReps. Suzanne Delbene, D-Wash., and Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., are working on introducing the bill, according to The Hill.\n\nSQUAD MEMBERS URGE BIDEN TO COMMUTE THE SENTENCES OF DEATH ROW INMATES\n\nThe bill was introduced in the last Congress and earned the support of 38 of 47 Democrats and 187 of 232 House Democrats. President Biden has since out in support of an expansion of the tax credit as part of a coronavirus relief package, but only for one year.\n\nA one-year expansion would cost about $120 billion, according to the nonpartisan fiscal watchdog Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Republicans are generally expected to oppose the measure due to its price tag.\n\nReps. DelBene and DeLauro are planning to reintroduce the American Family Act soon. We are currently working through technical changes to the bill, including discussions with the Biden administration on how this would be implemented to get benefits to families quickly and efficiently, Nick Martin, a DelBene spokesperson, said.\n\nOMAR CALLS ON BIDEN TO BACK 'RECURRING CASH PAYMENTS'\n\nThe president's support for this policy is a game-changer. The one-year expansion is important pandemic relief policy but permanently expanding the benefit could give millions of children the opportunity to succeed. The permanent expansion is estimated to lift 4 million children out of poverty and cut deep poverty among children in half, he added.\n\nThe current child tax credit is up to $2,000 per child 16 and under, and it reduces taxes on a dollar-for-dollar basis rather than in the form of a check. Up to $1,400 of the Child Tax Credit is refundable, meaning if taxes are reduced to zero for lower-income families they can get a refund on what is left over.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe credit phases out for single parents who make over $200,000 or couples who make over $400,000. The 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act increased the size of the credit for many families and the amount that is refundable. Such changes were pushed by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.
In just one day, the fate of the Senate -- and the nation -- will be decided by Georgia voters. While the ballots and votes cast will determine if Republican Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue deserve to be re-elected -- and it's undeniably clear that they do -- the Georgia runoff elections have far greater implications.\n\nIn the first two years of President Barack Obama's first term, we watched as a unified Congress controlled by Democrats rammed through ObamaCare and other liberal pieces of legislation, confirmed radical nominees to critical executive branch positions and promulgated progressive regulations that harmed our economy and our workers.\n\nRepublicans in Congress were powerless to stop this liberal assault on our values and institutions.\n\nIt wasn't until the 2010 elections — when I first ran for Senate — when Americans overwhelmingly rejected Obama's agenda and took back control of the House that Republicans in Congress could prevent further damage.\n\nSEN. DAVID PERDUE: GEORGIANS SHOULD VOTE FOR ME & SEN. LOEFFLER TO STOP DEMS' RADICAL SOCIALIST AGENDA\n\nIf Democratic Senate candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are elected on January 5th, the Democrats' impending socialist assault on our nation will make President Obama's first two years in office look moderate by comparison.\n\nIf Democrats are successful in the Georgia runoff elections on Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer will have the power to enact the radical left's socialist agenda that has become mainstream in today's Democratic Party. The Green New Deal, socialized medicine with care decided by unaccountable bureaucrats in Washington, European-style taxes on American industry and workers, radical regulations that will harm small businesses, and capitulation to the Chinese Communist Party will all be on the agenda.\n\nAnd make no mistake, the two Democratic candidates — Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff — have no business representing any state in Congress. Despite the legacy media's attempts to bury any negative evidence of their checkered pasts, it's clear that both Warnock and Ossoff are wholly unqualified to be U.S. senators. Georgia voters would be right to reject their candidacies outright even if the balance of the Senate wasn't on the ballot.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nSince President Trump's victory in the 2016 election, Republicans in Congress have worked with the administration to pass historic tax cuts for workers, families, and small businesses.\n\nWe have made progress in holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable for its continued assault on American workers and businesses. And we have confirmed a new generation of well-qualified nominees to our nation's judicial system who believe in the rule of law and the Constitution.\n\nOf course, the legacy media would have every American believe that the last four years have been a disaster. But no amount of hit pieces, negative articles, or tirades from cable news anchors can erase what our strong, conservative Republican majority has been able to accomplish.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGeorgia voters are quite literally our nation's last line of defense in protecting this legacy.\n\nOn January 5th, the entire nation will be watching. If Georgians believe in our democracy and our nation's institutions, they will reject Warnock and Ossoff. And in so doing, they will give Senate Republicans the power to prevent the socialist onslaught that the radical left is actively planning.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN. MARCO RUBIO
There are a lot of questions awaiting President Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, in his scheduled appearance Feb. 7 before the House Oversight and Reform Committee.\n\nHowever, the most immediate question will be whether Cohen's taking of the oath to testify will be followed by the usual comedic two drums and a cymbal riff. After a long and documented history as a liar and felon, Cohen's taking of any oath deserves proper musical accompaniment.\n\nNevertheless, Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., is right to call Cohen to testify. And to their credit, Republicans in the Senate are also considering calling Cohen before he goes off to prison.\n\nJONATHAN TURLEY: COHEN LIED, BROKE THE LAW AND USED TRUMP TO GET RICH --AND NOW BLAMES TRUMP FOR HIS TROUBLES\n\nCohen is not the first thoroughly discredited person to testify before Congress. The list ranges from mobster Frank Costello and quiz show fraud Charles Van Doren in the 1950s to drug gouger Martin Shkreli in 2016.\n\nHowever, even liars can supply details of criminal conduct. Now that Cohen has accused President Trump of involvement in criminal conduct, the American people deserve to hear Cohen's claims in greater detail. Moreover, the public has the right to see Cohen examined on those details and his own credibility in making these allegations.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty in federal court in August to tax fraud, making false statements to a bank and a campaign finance violation. He said the campaign finance violation involved a payment made during Trump's presidential campaign to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in return for her agreement not to publicize her allegation that she had an extramarital affair with Trump years earlier.\n\nCohen said he was directed by Trump to make the payment to Daniels. The president has denied he had an affair with Daniels and denied any wrongdoing regarding the payment.\n\nIn addition, Cohen pleaded guilty in November to lying to Congress about how long negotiations for a Trump Tower project in Moscow went on in 2016. No deal was reached on building the tower.\n\nNow that Cohen has accused President Trump of involvement in criminal conduct, the American people deserve to hear Cohen's claims in greater detail.\n\nCohen is heading to prison as a result of his guilty pleas – but not for as long as he deserves. U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III called Cohen's history a veritable smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct and said each of the crimes involved deception and each appears to have been motivated by personal greed and ambition.\n\nNew York federal prosecutors denounced Cohen as a manipulating liar with a long history of being a legal thug. Yet Pauley gave Cohen an extremely generous deal of just three years in prison. It was not half of what he deserved, but Cohen has lived his life from one scam to another.\n\nCohen is likely to try to portray himself now as a redemptive sinner – an act that is almost an affront to sin. For those who have long been critics of his infamous career (and the failure of the New York Bar to take action against him), the act will be as infuriating as it is unbelievable.\n\nCohen made himself rich victimizing more vulnerable people. In 2015, when Harvard Lampoon staffers played a prank on Trump by having him sit in the stolen president's chair from the Harvard Crimson for a photo and an endorsement, Cohen threatened the students with ruin.\n\nCohen was quoted by a student on the Harvard Lampoon staff as saying: I'm gonna come up to Harvard. You're all gonna get expelled. If this photo gets out, you'll be outta that school faster than you know it. I can be up there tomorrow.\n\nWhile some reporters are actively rehabilitating Cohen now that he is a foe to President Trump, Cohen previously lied to and threatened journalists on behalf of Trump. When former Daily Beast reporter Tim Mak wrote about a biography that included allegations from Trump's first wife, Ivana, that Trump raped her, Cohen did not hesitate to attack.\n\nIn a phone call recorded by Mak, Cohen told the reporter: You're talking about Donald Trump, you're talking about the frontrunner for the GOP, a presidential candidate, as well as private individual, who never raped anybody and, of course, understand that by the very definition you can't rape your spouse.\n\nAs a matter of law, it is a crime to rape anyone – including a spouse.\n\nCohen added in the recorded call: Mark my words for it, I will make sure that you and I meet ne day over in the courthouse and I will take you for every penny you still don't have, and I will come after your Daily Beast and everybody else.\n\nSo why would anyone want to hear anything from a guy who couldn't lie straight in bed? Because Trump selected Cohen to be his lawyer and employed him from 2006 until last year. Cohen served as a vice president of The Trump Organization and later as Trump's personal attorney.\n\nMore importantly, Cohen's allegations concerning the payoffs have some independent corroboration. Hush-money payments were made to Daniels and to another woman alleging an affair with Trump. Other people have reportedly supported the account that the payment to Daniels was made to suppress news that could have hurt Trump's chances of winning the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump picked not just Cohen but Paul Manafort – two of the deepest bottom feeders in the New York-Washington corridor. (Manafort served as chairman of the Trump presidential campaign and was convicted in August of eight charges of tax and bank fraud unrelated to his work on the Trump campaign. He also pleaded guilty in September to two conspiracy charges.)\n\nThis is the cost of such poor judgment by Trump regarding the people he has hired.\n\nThat does not make the payments a clear criminal act. As I have previously stated, there are strong defenses that Trump can raise over his motivations in the payments. Such a violation would ordinarily be handled as a civil matter with a fine rather than with a criminal charge.\n\nHowever, that does not mean that the allegations are not serious. Last year, I wrote columns saying that the payoffs represented the greatest threat to this White House and that Trump was facing an existential threat by keeping Cohen as his lawyer.\n\nObviously, anything Cohen says in his congressional testimony will have to be accepted with an asterisk denoting the sources as a serial liar. However, truth can sometimes be mined from a sinkhole of lies.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWill Cohen testify truthfully before Congress? It's impossible to say but it would be an exercise of hope over experience.\n\nWe need to have that truth. The cost is dealing with disreputable individuals like Cohen. In this case, we might want to proceed under President Reagan's famous pledge to trust but verify. With Cohen, however, I recommend dropping the trust part.
The Ford Mustang Mach-E California Route 1 is living up to its road trip-inspired name.\n\nThe mid-level model of the electric SUV has earned a 305-mile range from the EPA, which is more than any other Mach-E. Just.\n\nThe rear-wheel-drive vehicle comes with the largest battery pack available, a special set of aerodynamic wheels and a few other tweaks to help improve its efficiency over the Mach-E Premium, which is rated at 300 miles in the same configuration. The California Route 1 is more powerful, however, with a 290 hp motor to the Premium's 266 hp unit.\n\nThe California Route 1 starts at $50,900 and the Premium at $53,100, but both qualify for a $7,500 federal tax credit. Subtracting that brings the California Route 1 down to $43,400. The lowest-priced Tesla Model Y is currently the Rear-Wheel Drive Standard Range version, which delivers a 244-mile range for $43,190.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOf course, a cruise up the California coast can be a lot longer than that. A trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco on Route 1 running over 450 miles, which would require one stop for charging. According to Ford, the Mach-E's pack can be filled to 80 percent in about 45 minutes at a public DC fast charging station.
It is doubtful that the House and Senate could tackle the next COVID-19 package until the first week of March, Fox News has learned. But, the process to put a COVID relief measure on the floors of both the House and Senate begins next week.\n\nHere's the problem: How does the Senate move such a measure (still unwritten) and avoid a filibuster? That requires 60 yeas. Moreover, how do Democrats advance a plan in a 50/50 Senate? The answer is budget reconciliation. It is an arcane, one-year fiscal process that curbs debate in the Senate to only 20 hours. No filibusters allowed. And it only needs 51 votes to pass.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS ON DEMS GETTING LEGISLATION THROUGH WITH FILIBUSTER: 'DAMN RIGHT WE WILL'\n\nFox News has learned that the House Budget Committee will prepare a budget vehicle on Feb. 1. The measure would likely go to the House floor on Feb. 3. This vehicle is the essential first step. You can't do the substance of the coronavirus bill unless you have the reconciliation vehicle that allows the Senate to consider the actual package under these special rules.\n\nFox is told the Senate will likely move its budget reconciliation vehicle on Feb. 5.\n\nIn other words, this is the bus that will hold contents of the next COVID package -- and allow it to bypass filibusters.\n\nSANDERS THREATENS TO ADVANCE CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS WITH RECONCILIATION IF REPUBLICANS REFUSE SUPPORT\n\nFox News is told it will still take a couple of weeks to get the next coronavirus bill together, and that will likely hit the first week of March. But it could go earlier if the measure is ready.\n\nDemocrats used budget reconciliation to pass ObamaCare in 2010 because they couldn't get 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. Republicans unsuccessfully used reconciliation to try to do undo ObamaCare. And, Republicans also used reconciliation to approve tax reform.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeanwhile, many Americans have not yet received their $600 stimulus checks that were approved as part of the $900 billion relief package passed in December. Most Americans received $1,200 stimulus checks as part of the first relief bill back in April.\n\nFox News' Evie Fordham contributed to this report.
This is a rush transcript from The Ingraham Angle, February 13, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nSEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Malignant dictatorships we've hated in our foreign policy since WWII. Unfortunately you're insane Alec. We'll always seek the truth, we'll never be the media mob.\n\nPlease set your DVR every night. Let not your heart be troubled because Laura Ingraham's here. Hi.\n\nLAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Hannity, I'm always glad when that dry ice special effect comes up and I'm not the villain of the day. I'm always happy.\n\nHANNITY: Come on really?\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes.\n\nHANNITY: All right, so you really think that one day I'm going to choose you as the--\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes.\n\nHANNITY: You believe that.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes and then I'll make sure just let's cut corners, at least my staff will get to pitch fork and everything.\n\nHANNITY: If you do something that deserves it, that's it. You're going to be middle of the day but you're going to have to earn it. Alec Baldwin's tough to beat.\n\nINGRAHAM: But Hannity, I want to actually get real dry ice for your studio. I mean if you're going to do it, you got to do it right.\n\nHANNITY: You want like a concert.\n\nINGRAHAM: You got a fancy set up over there. I want the flames and the - I want the whole deal OK?\n\nHANNITY: You have the fanciest set up - you have as fancy a set up as I do. You have the same exact fancy.\n\nINGRAHAM: Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? I love our set. I'm not going to say anything else. We have a great set here. Tech people, you know the people when you ski, you go skiing, you don't ski but I'll just tell you the--\n\nHANNITY: These sets cost millions of dollars to build these things.\n\nINGRAHAM: Listen when someone goes skiing, right? And they have that $1000 pair of skis, it's fun to be on a pair of really old you know, old dogs on your feet and then you go whizzing right by because people are really nice studios. Then you have a rudimentary studio and you're number one. You're number one.\n\nHANNITY: Something like that. Whatever you say. I don't care.\n\nINGRAHAM: Hannity have a great night.\n\nHANNITY: Have a good show.\n\nINGRAHAM: All right, I'm Laura Ingraham. This is the Ingraham Angle from DC tonight. The Left is so overcome with their zeal to eject Trump from office that they're abandoning all their supposed principles to back perhaps a plutocrat like Mike Bloomberg. No. But will he sell out America to China?\n\nMy Angle explains how he might already have done it and speaking of Mini Mike, despite his old thoughts on stop and frisk resurfacing. We're hearing those tapes, the mayor made a pitch to black voters in Houston tonight. Did it work?\n\nWell, we sent a special guest inside and he went into the event. You know who it is. I'm not going to tell you who it is. Oh, you see him on the screen. Dinesh D'Souza. Already shock. I wanted you to have a little trick there. All right, the exclusive video that we got ahead.\n\nPlus, we were the only show to report on that deranged leftist who drove a van into a Trump voter registration tent in Florida and we have an important update on that story for you tonight.\n\nBut first, the big news today was Bill Barr defending decision to scale back Roger Stone's outrageous sentencing recommendation. Earlier today, the Attorney General told ABC news this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBILL BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: When I first saw the news reports, I said, gee, the news is spinning this. This is not what we were going to do.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you were surprised?\n\nBARR: I was very surprised. I said that night to my staff that we had to get ready because we had to do something in the morning to a man that can clarify what our position was. I had made a decision that I thought was fair and reasonable in this particular case.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Now Barr's right of course. Whatever your feelings about Roger Stone, he doesn't deserve nearly a decade in jail for lying about activity that's not even illegal. And on top of that Stone is 67 years old and has no criminal history.\n\nBut the media they're not interested in that part of the interview. No. Facts and details bore the chattering class. They unsurprisingly found this to be the big takeaway.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBARR: To have public statements and tweets made about the department, about people in the department, our men and women here, about cases pending in the department and about judges before whom we have cases, make it impossible for me to do my job.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Ah ha, a comment that almost everyone in Trump's orbit has said before is suddenly the new bomb shell.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nARI MELBER, MSNBC HOST: News here from what can only be described now as the besieged Attorney General of the United States.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: In his warped imagination, this is a terrible disloyal thing to do and these people must be punished.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Does Bill Barr have enough goodwill with the President and political capital that he can do something like this and get away with it.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He fired Sessions after almost two full years of simmering. We might get Barr leaving on his own.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: She always looks happy but like so many others, they misread what's really going on. The White House released a statement shortly after the interview reading in part, the President wasn't bothered by the comments at all and he has the right just like any other American citizen to publicly offer his opinions.\n\nThe president has full faith and confidence in AG Barr to do his job and uphold the law. The White House denial second matter to Democrat so they're going to still try to use the Stone case to make up for their embarrassing impeachment failure.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Something egregious like this demands that the Inspector General investigate.\n\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What Barr has done should mean that we are demanding a resignation. In effect, I won't resign from the House should start impeachment proceedings against him.\n\nSEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): Attorney General William Barr ought to be ashamed and be embarrassed and resign.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: And the media playing right along.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's almost every big decision that is coming through the Justice Department now has to be sent through the White House and checkout with the President and then do what the President - to the President bidding. We've never - we didn't see that in Watergate. This is why this is more sinister.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: It always goes back to being more sinister than Watergate. I mean they just have stock phrases. They just pull them off the shelf and spit him out on TV. Joining me now, John Eastman, Clairemont Institute Senior Fellow, constitutional scholar and Darrell Issa, former Chair of the House Oversight Committee that oversees the DOJ.\n\nAll right John, the media sees the sexy story of Trump versus Barr but they miss the fact that Barr was basically telling Trump, don't worry I got this.\n\nJOHN EASTMAN, SENIOR FELLOW, CLAREMONT INSTITUTE: I got this and you know, the Democrats to seem to overlook article two of the constitution. The executive powers vested in the President.\n\nThe top law enforcement officer is the Attorney General. If he wants to counteract decisions of the line prosecutor, that is their job. There's nothing wrong with this. And what was wrong with it is the egregious you know, pre-dawn raid on Roger Stone and throwing the book at this guy because they don't like his politics.\n\nINGRAHAM: And I have to say this Congressman Issa, that tweeting about a pending case, John and I know this, you know this, it is going to be a problematic thing because it's not - it's not going to necessarily affect any outcome nor should it.\n\nHowever, it does put the Attorney General in a bit of a pickle, does it not? Because then - wait a second - he's pressured. He wasn't pressured. He's doing what he thought was right but hence, the tweet hangs out over his shoulder and it makes it a little trickier for him.\n\nSo I do get that point.\n\nDARRELL ISSA (R-CA), FORMER CONGRESSMAN: Well, you know there's been no communicator in our history like Donald Trump and President Trump's need and desire and effectiveness to say what people are thinking including the unfair treatment of Roger Stone.\n\nTo be honest Trump's all these other things so yes, I understand how every member of the cabinet would prefer to have the Chief Executive just say, you've got this but in some cases like Eddie Gallagher who was unfairly treated, the navy seals or in the case of Roger Stone, the President having an opinion and if appropriate, the President using his ability to give clemency or pardoning, those are his rights.\n\nAnd so I don't think there's any question and I don't see a rift between the Attorney General and the President. Just the opposite. I see the Attorney General doing what he needs to do and not being afraid to say that the line attorneys and by the way, a very questionable federal judge in Amy Berman Jackson, you might remember, she's the one that gave Eric Holder, an extra two years to slow walk, fast and furious.\n\nI don't blame the President for doing what he's doing which is communicating to American people because they want to hear it now.\n\nINGRAHAM: Well, John again, it's just so you - remind everyone what happened here. Roger Stone, the jury foreman, Tomeka Hart who is in the Roger Stone jury called Roger Stone, racist, pre-trial. Called Trump supporters, racist. Likened Trump to the KKK. The foreperson on the jury praised the Mueller investigation and ran unsuccessfully for Congress as a Democrat.\n\nNow is there a reason the President should be unhappy about this?\n\nEASTMAN: Yes and in fact she lied in her - to the judge when she said she had no really - hadn't been following the Miller investigation. She had been tweeting about it the whole time. Look, there's another thing aspect of this and that's the gross double standard. President Obama gives a speech, exonerating Hillary Clinton before her Department of Justice lawyers do anything with Hillary Clinton and nobody's talking about that.\n\nTrump tweets out something on a decision that's already going to be made and all of a sudden, it's a new impeachable offense. I mean this is laughable.\n\nINGRAHAM: Now, I don't remember the media getting all bent out of shape when Obama weighed in on a myriad of legal cases.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The police acted stupidly.\n\nIf I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did you know about Hillary Clinton's use of private email server?\n\nOBAMA: No.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: While she was Secretary of State?\n\nOBAMA: No.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think it posed a national security problem?\n\nOBAMA: I don't think it posed a national security problem.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Remember that Congressman, you were in Congress when Obama was doing all this.\n\nEASTMAN: The double standards.\n\nISSA: Exactly, the double standard and by the way the double standard for Eric Holder. They clearly got away with this, you know Clapper and Comey and plenty of people have lied to Congress and have not been held accountable.\n\nYou know I'm on the campaign trail and everyday people ask me one thing, which is you know, you were effective chairman. You held these people accountable but nothing happened. The fact is under the last administration, they made sure that none of the people who lied to Congress, none of the people who did much worse things were actually prosecuted.\n\nEven Eric Holder who was referred for criminal contempt, the President bailed him out by claiming executive privilege only to later admit that those documents were never privileged documents but that's - that's forgotten by the so-called mainstream media and it's something that President Trump is not going to fail to say in real time because the American people need to hear it in real.\n\nINGRAHAM: All right, speaking of which I want to show everybody this. You were talking about Eric Holder, former AG for Obama. This is what he had to say about Barr in a tweet. He said, Do not underestimate the danger of the situation. The political appointees and the DOJ are involving themselves in an appropriate way in cases involving political allies of the President. This affects the rule of law and respect for it. Unprecedented. John.\n\nEASTMAN: Unprecedented except for what he did when he was head of the DOJ. He launched the most political efforts in the Department of Justice in our nation's history. He was cited for contempt of Congress, the first attorney General.\n\nINGRAHAM: Fast and furious.\n\nEASTMAN: Yes. Fast and furious for lying to Congress, for withholding documents without a bases and a privilege and he politicized every aspect of the Department of Justice.\n\nINGRAHAM: Remember when he did his first speech to the employees of the Department of Justice, let's see, a little quiz on the Ingraham Angle. You know what his first speech was to the employees?\n\nEASTMAN: I don't.\n\nINGRAHAM: We're a nation of cowards.\n\nEASTMAN: Oh, that's right.\n\nINGRAHAM: On the issue of race.\n\nEASTMAN: That's right.\n\nINGRAHAM: It was all about race and how the country's initiative - so that's how he introduced himself to the department.\n\nEASTMAN: Right and worse, they got a lot of those guys in his political appointees and then they converted them to career appointees who are still there in the deep state, working against the elected president.\n\nINGRAHAM: Congressman, how concerned are you that some of these same people are still burrowed in at DOJ and in agencies like the National Security Council.\n\nISSA: Well, I'm not just concerned that national security is - it's very clear that people see it. But the DOJ, I'm very concerned. You know, I talked to border patrol agents, rank and file, all the way up to their heads and they're frustrated that they're still being thwarted to do their job by those very people that were left embedded.\n\nYou know, one of the other things that Eric Holder should be remembered for, he came before Congress and asked about being the Chief Law Enforcement. He looked us in the eye and he said I wear two hats and in follow up, it became clear the two hats he wears, one is the chief law enforcement.\n\nThe other is a political appointee of President Obama.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes.\n\nISSA: That's something that Bill Barr never said and if he had said it, the Senate would have - the Democrats in the Senate would have had a hay day and yet openly, Eric Holder thought he was a political appointee and acted like one.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes, all right gentlemen, thank you so much. Great to see both of you tonight and the President today lambasted the lead juror in that case as I mentioned earlier. It looks like she did hide her anti-Trump bias during jury selection in the Roger Stone case.\n\nBut have no fear because the media quickly rode in to her defense.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was so struck by the President going after the foreperson on that jury today because you know, this is someone who has done their civic duty.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You see him interfering today, chastising the jurors in the Roger Stone case.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: His allies are waging a war against the jury itself who convicted Roger Stone.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trump has also attacked a Roger Stone juror, that's an American citizen, alleging without evidence, significant biased.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're seeing jury nullification at a presidential level.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Joining me now is former Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker. General Whitaker, was Trump justified in being outraged about this juror?\n\nMATT WHITAKER, FORMER ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL, UNITED STATES: Yes, this is an extraordinary moment and really, I remember when I was U.S. attorney and we'd have trials where there was allegations that jurors--\n\nINGRAHAM: U.S. attorney in Iowa for people who don't know your resume.\n\nWHITAKER: In Des Moines, Iowa. So well-qualified to talk about these issues. Both, have been the Attorney General plus have been a U.S. attorney and what I - what I know is that you know that once a juror is corrupt or has a bias that the whole system falls apart and this - and really you know, I think we should be concerned about jurors and especially here unfortunately in the district of Columbia, where they kind of game the system in and have biases that they aren't willing to admit.\n\nThis person clearly had maybe not prejudged the case but certainly, had a preferred outcome and opinions on the case.\n\nINGRAHAM: Is there any way to go back in and try to - I mean, you are saying it was jury nullification on the part of Trump. Is there any way to go back in and try to overturn this you know, this case at this point? Under just because of the juror?\n\nWHITAKER: Yes, so once the jury has rendered their decision, obviously there's all sorts of procedural things that attach and undoing a jury verdict is now is--\n\nINGRAHAM: No, very hard.\n\nWHITAKER: - is hard but not impossible.\n\nINGRAHAM: The DC circuit. You have to go to the DC circuit.\n\nWHITAKER: There's going to have to be a showing that it was bias and that you know, the outcome - it's harder. It's better to win a trial than to lose a trial and then try to appeal on various theories.\n\nBut - but there is - there is - the system will work and if this you know, person is demonstrated to have had these anti-Trump biases and anti-Stone biases, that can be undone.\n\nINGRAHAM: Just going back to the Bill Bar thing for a moment. I mean, you've known Bill Barr for a long time. I certainly have as well. Are you surprised by the way the media is playing this? I mean Barr - Barr is just like a - he's a no nonsense guy.\n\nHe wants to do the job and get his job done but he's been incredibly supportive of the President's agenda and incredibly phenomenal cabinet secretary over at justice but it's like they're trying to put a wedge in the relationship and President is like I have no problem with this.\n\nWHITAKER: There's no way. The president should and does have full confidence in Bill Barr. He's the perfect person to be Attorney General this time and let's - I mean, this idea that somehow the Attorney General is impotent to insert himself in the most important cases, highest profile cases facing the Department of Justice is just not true.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes, don't they work under him?\n\nWHITAKER: Absolutely. They - all of them are.\n\nINGRAHAM: These guys who quit in other words, were they justified - we're quitting because Bill Barr, were they political actors?\n\nWHITAKER: It's been clear from his interview that they had told him, they were going to do quite the opposite and then did exactly what he had said no, let's go another direction or decision had been made and they went the other direction anyway.\n\nThis seems to be a little bit of a - of a setup to cause this exact kerfuffle.\n\nINGRAHAM: Choreographed?\n\nWHITAKER: Yes, very much choreographed and you know, fundamentally, all of their powers derivative from the President and the Attorney General and if the Attorney General was led to believe and says, we should recommend - make this recommendation and they don't, you know, they shouldn't really resign, they should be concerned about being removed because that's a - that's an insubordinate act.\n\nINGRAHAM: I mean, this is article two. The President is the head of the executive branch. I mean this gets lost on a lot of people. It's like these runaway detailees from the CIA or from some other department or one prosecutor gets to run the show.\n\nWHITAKER: And just remember, career doesn't mean nonpartisan. We keep using that as inter-changeable terms and it just is not true.\n\nINGRAHAM: All right, Mr. Attorney General, great to see you.\n\nWHITAKER: Good to see you.\n\nINGRAHAM: Always great to see you. And coming up, the Democrat and media establishment seem to be warming to Mike Bloomberg but why won't they tell his full story? Up next, my Angle exposes how the former New York City Mayor has put China's interests perhaps ahead of ours.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nINGRAHAM: In Bloomberg's China cabinet. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. After I was counting chaos and slim wins for Pete and Bernie in the first two nominating contest and after Biden's campaign collapsed, you can kind of feel things changing in the Democratic Party.\n\nYou can feel it and you can hear it. I'm talking about the murmurs for Mike, the banter for Bloomy.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: A big winner last night could be Mayor Bloomberg.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bloomberg looks well-positioned now to swoop in.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He wasn't given his money like Donald Trump was. He earned it the old fashioned way.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's done more to reduce violence, not only in his own city but cities across America, more than any single living person.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mike Bloomberg can win this campaign. Donald Trump knows it. He's afraid.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Well, Bloomberg in a way is everything that they love. Where Trump is a proud nationalist, Bloomberg's a citizen of the world. He's a globalist from Manhattan who is phase by mass abortions but agonizes over the climate.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMICHAEL BLOOMBERG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: No matter what you think of climate change that it really has the potential to destroy our world. Which means stopping polluting and all those kinds of things.\n\nIf you want 32 ounces, take two cups to your seed, if you want 64 carry four but our hope is if you only take one, you won't go back.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Oh, this is going to be fun. What's not to like? Well, a lot actually and it's not just that he's bad on guns, bad on immigration, terrible on healthcare and our food choices. Bloomberg's really bad when it comes to our chief economic and military threat.\n\nI'm talking about China. In fact, he can't even bring himself to use the correct words to describe their government.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBLOOMBERG: The communist party wants to stay in power in China and they listen to the public. When the public says, I can't breathe the air, Xi Jinping is not a dictator, he has to satisfy his constituents or he's not going to survive.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's not a dictator?\n\nBLOOMBERG: No, he has to - he has a constituency to answer to. No government survives without the will of the majority of its people.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The idea that the Chinese government is responsive to sort of the democratic expression of fresh air, clean air.\n\nBLOOMBERG: Oh, come on, of course they are.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: That, in and of itself should tell us all, he should never be President. They're responsive, the Chinese government? Oh, not to the people. To the dictatorship, oh OK, that makes it OK.\n\nNow and he said this, remember China was in the midst of a brutal suppressing of the pro-democracy demonstration at Hong Kong and as we were just learning at the time, the true extent of China's vast array of concentration camps for those Uighur Muslims.\n\nBloomberg has been getting increasingly tight with the Chinese for years. He loves their massive market place and they love his money and influence in the United States.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBLOOMBERG: I first met him 15 years ago at a dinner in my house when he was the Mayor of Beijing. Today he is the most influential political figure in China and in the world. Please join me in welcoming the Vice President of China, Wang Qishan.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: He's gushing over China's Vice President. Took place at the New Economy Forum that Bloomberg's company holds every year. Now, guess where they hosted this 2019 conference?\n\nWhy Beijing, of course. Of course. I'm telling you, keep your eye on Bloomberg's business activities in China. They're actually increasing as he's running for President.\n\nDemocrats might not be asking any questions about this but Newt Gingrich sure is.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nNEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER SPEAKER OF HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: What percent of his fortune came from cutting deals with the dictatorship in China? What share of the money he's going to spend to try to buy the presidency actually came from China because of his willingness to be cozy with a dictatorship?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: While China was cheating at trades, stealing our intellectual property and putting American companies out of business, Bloomberg was helping Beijing get richer and more powerful.\n\nThe Washington Post is reporting, Bloomberg while showering praise on the Communist Party leaders whose goodwill is required to play a role in the fast-growing market, led efforts since 2015 to make it easier for U.S. companies to trade in Chinese currency and expanded one of his company's financial indexes which could steer $150 billion into China while earning his firm on undisclosed amount in fees.\n\nOh, my friends we're talking billions and billions of dollars in fees made in communist China and here's a fun little fact, Bloomberg's operations rake in more money each year from China and Hong Kong than all of the businesses of the Trump organization combined that they made in all of 2018.\n\nSo with all this, whom do you think China's rooting for in November? Do they want the current president who's forced them to make concessions on trade, the one who slapped tariffs on them or would they want the guy who will basically give them everything they want?\n\nFollow the tweets from the Mayor's media company for any length of time and you'll see it's constantly pushing a pro-China agenda. They've even been called out for spiking stories critical of Beijing over at Bloomberg. Look at this headline about the coronavirus from last week.\n\nChina sacrifices a province to save the world from coronavirus. And this one. The U.S. charges a leading nanoscientist with lying about his work with the Thousand Talents program. Will China's most brilliant minds balk at coming to America? So you get the idea.\n\nNow, it will be hilarious but not completely surprising if it ends up being Bloomberg versus Trump. Now think about it. Democrats, the self-anointed champions of human rights choosing a pro-China guy as their nominate. They're also supposedly pro-American worker.\n\nSo how would it look to pick a guy who will just end up making it easier for companies here to ship jobs over there? And my goodness, how will it make the squad feel if their party runs one New York billionaire against another billionaire? The answer. Now well.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): It's physically impossible. The whole thing is a joke.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You guys are crazy.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is simply a disruption and a distraction.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: You get the point. They're not going to be happy and that's the Angle. All right, joining me now, Richard Goodstein, Attorney, former adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton along with Charlie Hurt, Opinion Editor for The Washington Times and a Fox news contributor.\n\nAll right Richard, if it means beating Trump, will Democrats defend Bloomberg's remarks and business ties to China which are vast?\n\nRICHARD GOODSTEIN, FORMER ADVISER TO BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON: Yes, so the short answer is of course. That's you know, Democrats are so intent on beating Donald Trump, I think that they would be happy to have Michael Bloomberg and indeed, they're probably thrilled to see in this Quinnipiac poll that I've seen cited repeatedly over the past few days on Fox news, Michael Bloomberg beating Donald Trump by nine points today.\n\nThis is after these best few weeks of Donald Trump's political life.\n\nINGRAHAM: All right, stay on track. Stay on track what I'm focused on. The Democrat party has prided itself on being the party of human rights. Divestment in South Africa. They blast Israel with a boycott, divestment deal on college campuses and yet, there is a thought they may embrace this guy who can't even call the Chinese government, a Chinese dictatorship, a communist government system and is cosying up to the dictators over there and to the way that he is.\n\nI mean how does that work Richard? How do you square that?\n\nGOODSTEIN: So I actually agree with something that Newt Gingrich said on that tape that you ran, which is let's see how much business Mike Bloomberg made from China and there's a way to get to the bottom of it.\n\nSame with Donald Trump, release your tax returns. OK? That's how we'll actually know how much is talk and how much is nonsense. And incidentally, running $1 trillion deficits is not exactly the way to get leverage over the Chinese. That's actually helps --\n\nINGRAHAM: So, again, Charlie, I'm trying to just get my head wrapped around this. Michael Bloomberg, who makes billions of dollars in China, is going to be tougher on China than Donald Trump has been? Are you kidding me? These people hated tariffs. They hated his tariffs.\n\nCHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, WASHINGTON TIMES: And that is exactly the point. Whatever investment the Trump companies have had in China, Donald Trump has been tougher on China than any president we have had in three decades.\n\nAnd I'm so grateful to you, Laura, for running that package right there, because it is so important. Not only is it a wonderful precursor to what we are going to see in ads from the Trump against a candidate like Bloomberg, but it is also very important reminder -- and you were one of the few people in the media industry who caught onto this early. One of the most powerful platforms Donald Trump ran on was his opposition to China. He understood what people in regular America thought about China, what they had seen China doing to regular Americans' jobs over the past three decades that politicians in both parties had ignored for decades. And Donald Trump is the first one to call them on it. And we have seen in his first term he is willing to confront them on it. And that right there speaks --\n\nINGRAHAM: Bernie Sanders is pretty good on China. It goes from Marco Rubio to Bernie Sanders. Republicans and Democrats are now waking up to the China threat. This is not some minor issue. The 21st century is either going to be ours or it's going to be China's. No doubt about it. And yet Bloomberg, he can't bring himself to say communist dictatorship. I don't know what you do.\n\nGOODSTEIN: I love the fact that Donald Trump has imposed tens of billions of dollars of taxes, tariffs we'll call them, on American consumers. We know that. That is not disputable.\n\nHURT: By standing up to China?\n\nGOODSTEIN: And ostensibly that is opposing some hardship on China.\n\nHURT: By standing up to China?\n\nGOODSTEIN: And meanwhile, the bailout of our auto industry was a pittance compared to what we have now had to bail out our farmers because Donald Trump has basically imposed these tariffs to make their lives miserable.\n\nHURT: Tariffs for selling goods into our country? I don't think -- that is not a tax on American people. That is actually money coming into the government coffers.\n\nGOODSTEIN: But Chinese imports -- listen, goods coming from China into the United States are being tariffed.\n\nINGRAHAM: Hold on, let's do a little economics. Why aren't we having inflation now then? Where's our inflation? If what you are saying is true, where are all the inflationary pressures on buying in the United States? They're not there. The answer is there is no inflationary tendency in this market right now.\n\nGOODSTEIN: Yes. And the fact of the matter is if the public was so thrilled with the state of the economy, Donald Trump wouldn't be down nine points down to Michael Bloomberg, Republicans would not be minus eight in the generic ballot. Donald Trump would not be under water by --\n\nINGRAHAM: Hillary was up by, what, 15 points nationally?\n\nGOODSTEIN: I agree that polls can be off.\n\nINGRAHAM: Your people were up 15 points, Hillary was up 15 points, and that went down in flames. This will too, as well. But Michael Bloomberg is a crafty person. He's very smart obviously, but this is the quintessential struggle, America versus China. Gentlemen, great conversation.\n\nSpeaking of Mike Bloomberg, fresh off his stop and frisk controversy, he held an event in Houston tonight to woo African-American voters. So what did they think? We sent Dinesh D'Souza inside to find out, and he has the video next. And then Herman Cain responds.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nINGRAHAM: Mike Bloomberg is making his pitch to African-Americans in Houston, Texas, tonight, and this comes after years old videos resurfacing showing Bloomberg saying un-woke things about stop and frisk and redlining. Bloomberg repudiated these past remarks, but what people at his campaign event tonight, what do they think? We sent conservative author and filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza to find out, and he joins us now. Dinesh, here is a conversation you had with two ladies. Let's watch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE FILMMAKER: You've heard about Bloomberg and the stop and frisk program. Is that something that bothers you about Mike, or are you OK with Mike's position on stop and frisk?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Maybe with good intentions, but you can't implicate policies that are going to ostracize certain populations.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm a mother of a young black boy. I have an eight- year-old son. And ultimately, I don't want him to be judged just by what he has on or the color of his skin. So stop and frisk, do I agree with it? Absolutely not.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: So Dinesh, those ladies were not happy about stop and frisk, but he apologized for it. He went to a church and he did a big mea culpa. And was that the common response tonight?\n\nDINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE FILMMAKER: Yes, I think this was a crowd of Democratic activists. There was a kind of skeptical openness to Bloomberg, not real enthusiasm I don't think, but a willingness to hear him out. I think the issues that they are concerned about is hypocrisy, because Bloomberg saying one thing and doing another.\n\nAnd so my send, it was funny, because as I tried to interview people, I realized that half the people there worked for Bloomberg. So one after the other, I work for Bloomberg, I work for Bloomberg. I wouldn't be surprised if a fourth of the audience works for Bloomberg. I couldn't find people who were not on Bloomberg payroll to talk to. And the mood was open-minded, but a little doubtful.\n\nINGRAHAM: Dinesh, is that a Bloomberg pin you have on I'm noticing on your lapel? What is that all about? Is that how you got in there?\n\nD'SOUZA: I don't think I can keep it on much longer because I came here right from the event, but as I walked in, they slapped it on me. Everyone has to have one of these to get in. So this was the price of admission. I don't think it's good for my career for me to keep it on too long.\n\nINGRAHAM: One of the more troubling interactions tonight was about black unemployment numbers. I want to play that. Watch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't believe those numbers are reflective of what is actually happening with the employment situation.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: How does the president combat that disinformation? The economy has never been better for black America, and yet there are people in that audience saying I don't believe those numbers.\n\nD'SOUZA: I think it is just sheer cognitive dissonance, because these are people who have been bombarded with anti-Trump propaganda. And so then when they see Trump at the State of the Union recite this litany of great things one after the other -- a strong economy, an economy that is disproportionately benefiting the working class and African-Americans and other minorities, it's almost as if, how can that be? And so a certain kind of dissonance I think creeps in which you are forced to deny the facts in order to support the hypothesis that you have been force-fed over many, many years.\n\nINGRAHAM: Dinesh, the Quinnipiac poll that just came out, black support in the Democratic primary, Biden is at 27, he's fallen quite a bit, though, Bloomberg is at 22 percent, Sanders, 19, Buttigieg is at four. Poor little Amy is at zero, not sure what is going on there. But does that comport with what you saw tonight? This is after this tape was played, and Trump has been slamming him, but he seems pretty popular among African-Americans according to that poll.\n\nD'SOUZA: The crowd I saw was -- they were all these local -- Houston is a Democratic city. People think because it's Texas, it's got to be conservative. No. It's a Democratic city, and all the Democratic local officials were there. They had rustled up their local audiences. There were like 25 speakers before Bloomberg got to the podium. So this was one of those coming together moments. And Bloomberg has got the money. Maybe there is a feeling that the cash ultimately will deliver the goods with Bloomberg. and I think ultimately Bloomberg may just be the beneficiary of Biden's rapid political hemorrhaging, which seems to be occurring on all fronts.\n\nINGRAHAM: All right, Dinesh, thanks so much for going out tonight.\n\nAnd as Bloomberg pitches black voters in Houston, major African-American donors are airing their grievances about the 2020 field. Politico reporting that The Democratic Party's black donor class believes the candidates aren't doing enough to court the black community. I wonder why they are so worried.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There are things we can and should do right away that could deal with black money. I'm sorry, dark money.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: African-American money.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I'm always happy to take black money contributions.\n\nBLOOMBERG: I think we disproportionately stop whites too much and minorities too little.\n\nJOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Oh, my gosh, that is quite a montage.\n\nJoining me now is Herman Cain, former 2012 GOP presidential candidate, and Scott Bolden, attorney, former chair of the D.C. Democrat Party. Herman, is this an opening for President Trump to woo black voters given these various missteps, some of which you just saw.\n\nHERMAN CAIN (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't think it is an opening for president Trump to woo black voters because President Trump is trying to woo the United States of America. The results that this president has been able to achieve have helped all people. That is the difference. The Democrats and the liberals continue to think that there are specific things that they can say or do that's going to woo black voters. The only thing that black voters and brown voters have in common is that they are black and brown. They are not politically aligned. They are not ideologically aligned. They're no monolithic. So to try to put them in a homogeneous group as one group all the time is a mistake. And all you have to do is look at the reputable polls, and you will see that the support for President Trump from black people has grown and grown and grown.\n\nINGRAHAM: Scott, your response?\n\nSCOTT BOLDEN, FORMER D.C. DEMOCRATIC PARTY CHAIRMAN: I don't think the polls are very credible just based on not just anecdotal, but the mythology that somehow Donald Trump, because of the economy and because of black unemployment at its lowest level is going to translate into votes for Donald Trump. Every poll, Quinnipiac or otherwise, has him in the single digits, and that is not going to change.\n\nWhat's driving black support and black donors not giving isn't because they believe they've been taken for granted. We agree with Republicans that the Democrats take black people for granted and our money for granted. What the reason the money is being held right now is because the number one priority is beating Donald Trump, and none of the Democratic candidates at this point, given how early it is, no one is convinced as to who that nominee is going to be who is going to get Donald Trump one-on-one.\n\nAnd so you're going to have a lot of money held up. I'm a black donor. I sit on the Democratic Business Council. I haven't given to a Democratic presidential candidate yet because ultimately beating Donald Trump and who is that nominee going to be, we are way early on this.\n\nINGRAHAM: You've got to make a decision.\n\nI want to play something that Elizabeth Warren had said going back to this Bloomberg issue where he does this mea culpa for standing up for stop and frisk, and makes comments about disproportionate crime. Then he walks them back, and he's just throwing money into this race, $150 million already spent, going to spend half-a-billion, I guess, on this race. This is what she said about Bloomberg. Watch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Michael Bloomberg is saying, in effect, that the 2008 financial crash was caused because the banks weren't permitted to discriminate against black and brown people.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: It is getting ugly out there, Herman Cain. Warren doesn't have much of a chance at this point, but she is staying in it, and she is going to pick up Bloomberg quite a bit on this race run. Does he have enough money to overcome it?\n\nCAIN: No, he does not have enough money to overcome it. I have said this before and on your show -- many black people have left the Democrat plantation and they are not going back. They are not going to be swayed by Michael Bloomberg having a lot of money to go up against Donald Trump.\n\nAnd I agree with your guest on one thing. Beat Trump, that is not a strategy. The reason that Joe Biden is falling and falling and falling in favor with the base is because they don't have an alternative to the policies that have proven to work so well. And I happen to believe that some of the black people who don't believe these low black unemployment numbers are simply victims of brainwashing by the news and the cable outlets that they watch. So no, I don't buy it. And there are some credible polls out there. Emerson is a credible poll, and Gallup is a credible poll, and they both came up with the same results.\n\nINGRAHAM: We've got to roll, guys.\n\nBOLDEN: Maybe, maybe not. But the bottom line is that black people aren't voting for Donald Trump in numbers. And when we get a Democratic nominee, black people are not going to leave Bloomberg or any of the other potential nominees simply because there is no litmus test on race or stop and frisk. There are no perfect white candidates who address all the African-American issues. They are all flawed.\n\nINGRAHAM: They address the American issues, which is everybody's issues. Health, security, the border, and economic concerns.\n\nBOLDEN: That's true, and beating Trump is the Democratic number one priority.\n\nINGRAHAM: Herman and Scott, great to see you both tonight.\n\nAnd coming up, last weekend a radical leftist plowed his van into supporters for Trump tent registering to vote. And this was in Florida over the weekend, so why isn't the media talking about this? For what reason? We have an update on that story. Plus, yet another act of political violence against Trump supporters. Stay there.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nINGRAHAM: Now the latest on that disturbing van attack on a GOP voter registration tent in Jacksonville, Florida, over the weekend. As I predicted, the driver, a man named Gregory Timm, admitted he was motivated by his dislike, his hatred for President Trump.\n\nJoining me now is Dean Black, Duval County GOP chair. Dean, after it was confirmed this was politically motivated, there haven't been any media follow-ups on this story by the big three network, MSNBC and CNN as well. Why do you think that is?\n\nDEAN BLACK, DUVAL COUNTY GOP CHAIRMAN: We know exactly why that is, Laura. Dinesh D'Souza said it a few moments ago. We will call it cognitive dissonance. Clearly, they are biased. Clearly, the mainstream media isn't interested in doing the job of journalism in this country. They would rather point the finger at us when it's their own house that's on fire.\n\nAnd this violence is actually occurring all over the country. This is not just a Jacksonville thing, it's happened up in Maine, there was another incident down south of here. It happens all the time. And they refused to acknowledge it.\n\nINGRAHAM: There was actually another act of political violence in New Hampshire. I don't know if it's being tolerated, and then OK, I can do something and nothing is going to happen to me, or because the media doesn't cover it, but this is just going to keep happening.\n\nBLACK: That's right. And if they don't, like I said the other night, Laura, we are nine months away from the election. People are going to get more and more excited. And right now they have a duty to their profession and to the country to call this out, because this has no place in our electoral system. And no one, thankfully, was injured in Jacksonville.\n\nINGRAHAM: It could've been, Dean. We've got to roll.\n\nBLACK: It could've been.\n\nINGRAHAM: But unbelievable story. Media very dishonest about it.\n\nWhen we come back, the return of the Twitter smackdown.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The American Constitution is sexist by its very design. This country's laws have historically treated us like second class citizens. We still face tremendous barriers to our full participation in society.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: I had to bring back the Twitter smack down of the day after seeing that atrocity tweeted out by Pressley herself.

The White House announced Thursday morning that President Biden will sign an executive order rescinding a rule known as the Mexico City policy which prohibits foreign non-governmental organizations from receiving U.S. funding if they promote or perform abortion as a method of family planning.\n\nThe policy, first turned into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1985 and announced at a UN conference in Mexico City, has been repealed by Democratic presidents and reinstated by Republicans for decades. Biden's order will come almost four years to the day since former President Donald Trump signed an order that revived it.\n\nBIDEN TO SIGN EXECUTIVE ORDERS EXPANDING ACCESS, STRENGTHENING OBAMACARE THROUGH SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD\n\nAcross the country and around the world, people -- particularly women, Black, Indigenous and other people of color, LGBTQ+ people, and those with low incomes -- have been denied access to reproductive health care, the White House said in a statement announcing that Biden will protect and expand access to comprehensive reproductive health care through a presidential memorandum. The memorandum reflects the policy of the Biden-Harris Administration to support women's and girls' sexual and reproductive health and rights in the United States, as well as globally.\n\nTrump's 2017 memorandum had revived the policy under President George W. Bush, which prohibited the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) from giving money to foreign NGOs that performed or promoted abortion, with exceptions for rape, incest, or when needed to save a life.\n\nBIDEN SEES SHARP PARTISAN DIVIDE OVER PERFORMANCE ONE WEEK INTO PRESIDENCY: POLL\n\nTrump's memo directed the State Department to extend this to all federal departments and agencies. According to a 2020 State Department report, only eight out of 1,340 prime awardees who received funding between May 2017 and September 2018 declined to adhere to the expanded policy.\n\nA new poll from Marist and the Knights of Columbus showed that 58% of Americans oppose or strongly oppose using taxpayer dollars to support abortion. That included a 65% of Independents and 31% of Democrats.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe poll indicated some kind of opposition to overseas funding of abortion, asking more broadly: Do you strongly support, support, oppose, or strongly oppose using tax dollars to support abortion in other countries?\n\nA majority of Americans (77%) opposed or strongly opposed that proposition, including 64% who identified as pro-choice.\n\nFox News' Sam Dorman contributed to this report.
Former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick was among 70 people who had their prison sentences commuted by President Trump early Wednesday, just hours before the end of the president's term in office.\n\nThe commutation had been long sought by Kilpatrick, 50, who has served roughly seven years of a 28-year sentence for public corruption crimes on which he was convicted in 2013.\n\nAs a result of President Trump's decision, Kilpatrick will be released from prison early.\n\nSeventy-three other people, including former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, received pardons from the president.\n\nWhat was his road to commutation?\n\nKilpatrick, a Detroit native and Democrat, was a Michigan state representative from 1997 to 2002 before serving as the mayor of Detroit from 2002 to 2008.\n\nTRUMP PARDONS STEVE BANNON, LIL WAYNE, DOZENS OF OTHERS; ALSO COMMUTES SENTENCES\n\nThe former mayor's downfall began when the Detroit Free Press published text messages between him and his female chief of staff that appeared to show he lied during a police whistleblower trial while denying an affair between the pair. He resigned from office in 2008.\n\nKilpatrick was sentenced to 28 years in federal prison in 2013 after he was convicted of racketeering conspiracy, fraud, extortion, and tax crimes related to shaking down contractors and rewarding his allies. The government called the scheme the Kilpatrick enterprise.\n\nHe has maintained his innocence and been fighting his sentence ever since. However, all of his appeals have failed over the years.\n\nThe 6th Circuit Court of Appeals had denied his original appeal of his conviction and sentence in 2015, according to Detroit's WDIV-TV.\n\nHe filed another motion in 2017 to vacate his prison sentence, which was denied by a district court judge, the station reported.\n\nHe later asked Trump for a presidential pardon and clemency in a blog post back in 2018.\n\nBy God's grace, I have received a pardon from Him, through Christ Jesus. I pray that I will receive the opportunity for Pardon/Clemency from the President of the United States as well, he wrote on the Free Kwame Project website, according to FOX 2 of Detroit.\n\nEX-DETROIT MAYOR KWAME KILPATRICK WILL BE RELEASED FROM PRISON THIS WEEK, SISTER CLAIMS\n\nIn 2019, he was denied again by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, reports said. The U.S. Supreme Court even refused to hear his case, according to the Detroit Free Press.\n\nLast year, rumors spread that he was going to be freed early and allowed to live in home confinement in Georgia, the paper reported.\n\nIn November, Michigan state Rep. Karen Whitsett and family members said Kilpatrick would be released -- after claiming in May that he would be out due to the coronavirus. Both never happened.\n\nIn a February letter to President Trump, the Ebony Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to combating mass incarceration, argued that Kilpatrick's lengthy sentence was not appropriate for his crimes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKilpatrick has been incarcerated at a low-security prison in Louisiana and was originally scheduled to be released in January 2037 before Trump's commutation order was announced early Wednesday.\n\nFox News' Brie Stimson and Louis Casiano contributed to this report.
The Mega Millions lottery is still looking for a winner to claim the second-largest grand prize in the game's history.\n\nThe pot has grown to rarified territory, with the jackpot reaching an estimated $850 million after no winner was declared during Friday's drawing.\n\nMEGA MILLIONS $750M JACKPOT: HERE'S THE TAX HIT\n\nLottery winners can either opt for a cash option -- a one-time, lump-sum payment -- or an annuity paid out over the course of about 30 years.\n\nThe cash option is estimated at about $628.2 million.\n\nNot only does this mark the second-largest prize in the game's history, but it's also the third-largest prize in American lottery history.\n\nTo date, the world-record Powerball jackpot is still $1.586 billion, which was claimed in January 2016.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeanwhile, the Mega Millions record sits at $1.537 billion, which was claimed two years later in October of 2018.\n\nThe numbers that were drawn Friday night were 3, 11, 12, 38 and 43 as well as the gold Mega Ball of 15.\n\nAlthough no one hit the big jackpot, there were more than 4.6 million winning tickets at all prize levels, officials said. Eight tickets even matched the five white balls and won the game's second prize of $1 million.
Good morning and welcome to Fox News First. Here's what you need to know as you start your day ...\n\n\n\nMigrant caravan member cites Biden's pledge to suspend deportations for 100 days as reason for traveling to US\n\nA migrant traveling with a caravan that left Honduras on Friday told a reporter he was headed to the U.S. because soon-to-be President Joe Biden is giving us 100 days to get to the U.S.\n\nThe migrant, seen in an interview shared by The Hill, did not provide his name but said he was from Roatán, a tourist island off the northern coast of Honduras.\n\n\n\nHe appeared to be citing Biden's pledge to place a 100-day moratorium on deportations – one of several items on his agenda that will reverse some of President Donald Trump's signature policies.\n\n\n\nThe migrant told a reporter he was fleeing a bad situation that was made worse by the coronavirus pandemic, hurricanes, and a president who is not helping the people.\n\nWhen asked what he wanted, the migrant said it was to get to the U.S. because they're having a new president.\n\nHe's gonna help all of us, the migrant said of President-elect Joe Biden. He's giving us 100 days to get to the U.S. to get legal status and get a better life for our kids and family.\n\nBiden has promised a pathway to legal permanent residency for those in the country illegally and a suspension on deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

She said the president had other agendas while in the White House and hopes that one day it becomes known who exactly the president was beholden to and who pulls his strings.\n\n\n\nI would love to see his phone records to see if he was talking to Putin the day the insurgents invaded our Capitol, she said.

Yet California, despite being among the strictest in the nation when it comes to COVID lockdowns, has recorded nearly twice that figure since the start of the pandemic.\n\n\n\nThough Florida has a smaller population than California, both states have roughly the same number of cases per 100,000 residents.\n\n\n\nCalifornia Gov.

Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has accused White House senior adviser and President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner of a political hit job by engineering his ouster from Trump's transition team following the 2016 election.\n\nChristie writes in his forthcoming book, Let Me Finish (excerpts of which were published by The Guardian on Tuesday) that while future White House chief strategist Steve Bannon was tasked with informing Christie of his dismissal days after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton, Bannon made clear to me that one person and one person only was responsible for the faceless execution that Steve was now attempting to carry out. Jared Kushner, still apparently seething over events that had occurred a decade ago.\n\nThat's a reference to Christie's prosecution of Kushner's father, Charles, while Christie was U.S. attorney for New Jersey in 2005. The elder Kushner eventually pleaded guilty to illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion and witness tampering and served 14 months in federal prison. As part of the plea deal, Charles Kushner admitted recording a sexual encounter between his brother-in-law and a prostitute and sending the tape to his sister in retaliation for what he believed was their cooperation with prosecutors.\n\nHOUSE DEMS TO PROBE IVANKA TRUMP, JARED KUSHNER AND USE OF PERSONAL EMAIL ACCOUNTS\n\nThe kid's been taking an ax to your head with the boss [Trump] ever since I got here, Christie has Bannon telling him.\n\nChristie, a 2016 Republican presidential candidate who endorsed Trump after withdrawing from the race, claims that Kushner pleaded with Trump in Christie's presence not to make him head of the transition team in April 2016.\n\nHe implied I had acted unethically and inappropriately but didn't state one fact to back that up, writes Christie, who says Kushner's ire was based on very raw feelings that had been simmering for a dozen years.\n\nEX-TRUMP AIDE ADMITS HE MADE UP STORY ABOUT CHRIS CHRISTIE BEING SENT TO PICK UP MCDONALD'S\n\nChristie also describes being told by a high-ranking Trump staffer that the candidate's family was very upset about the possibility that Trump might pick Christie as his running mate, a role that ultimately went to then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. Christie was also passed over for the posts of attorney general (in favor of then-Sen. Jeff Sessions) and chair of the Republican National Committee (in favor of Ronna McDaniel). Christie is particularly critical of Sessions, whom he describes as not ready for prime time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHaving been denied his choice of administration posts, Christie writes that he turned down offers to be secretary of labor, secretary of homeland security, ambassador to Italy and ambassador to Vatican City. Christie also turned down the role of special assistant to the president in the White House, which he says Trump offered him personally.\n\nLet Me Finish: Trump, the Kushners, Bannon, New Jersey and the Power of In-Your-Face Politics is due out Jan. 29.\n\nClick for more from The Guardian.
Teachers in Los Angeles public schools went on strike last week, holding 500,000 kids and their parents hostage as they demand more money for the lousy job their system does at providing an education.\n\nThe Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) boasts of graduating about 80 percent of students. But only 60 percent of those who graduated actually completed the necessary coursework, reflecting an unfortunate practice of passing students who don't actually make the grade.\n\nIn 2017, only 40 percent of students in the school district met national standards for literacy. Only an abysmal 30 percent met math standards.\n\nIS THE LOS ANGELES TEACHER STRIKE REALLY ABOUT THE KIDS?\n\nWhile the public school system claimed it only spent $12,073 per pupil in 2017, this number excludes the cost of buildings and other depreciable assets. A study noted that were these expenses to be included, the per-pupil cost would more than double the official figure. In other words, the lousy education that Los Angeles public schools provides actually costs taxpayers more than sending students to most private schools. The problem isn't money; it's government incompetence.\n\nNow the teachers' union is demanding still more money even as the number of students instructors have to teach declines. The district has lost 245,000 students over the past fifteen years. As education researcher Lisa Snell of the Reason Foundation noted, even as it was losing students, the number of total LAUSD employees grew by 5 percent over the last five years, primarily thanks to a nearly 16 percent increase in administrators. Snell also found that employee benefit costs increased 110 percent in just the last four years, and the school district's long-term debt liability jumped from $8 billion in 2007 to a whopping $25 billion in 2017.\n\nThat's more government bloat for less education.\n\nThe lousy education that Los Angeles public schools provides actually costs taxpayers more than sending students to most private schools.\n\nTo the extent they are allowed, parents of LA's kids are voting with their feet, opting in ever-larger numbers to send their kids to charter schools. Some 138,000 Los Angeles students now attend charter schools, which deliver unambiguously better results. Naturally, the teachers' union hates this competition. In addition to seeking higher salaries as part of their strike demands, they also want more regulations to stifle the growth of charter schools.\n\nThis presents a conundrum for politicians in Los Angeles, a one-party town in a one-party state dominated by Democrats. Do they stand with parents and taxpayers or with government unions? If history is any guide, they'll side with the government unions.\n\nOverall, the crisis is par for the course in California. Government unions demand ever higher benefits, especially fat pensions that vastly exceed what is available to private sector workers. Politicians who depend on votes and donations from the government unions are all too eager to say yes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThat is one reason why California has ended up with government debt that is at least $1.3 trillion and may actually be closer $2.3 trillion. The state's pension liability alone is $1 trillion. Plus California is still racking up new liabilities for pet projects like former Governor Jerry Brown's $100 billion high-speed train to nowhere. The new governor, Gavin Newsome, has promised to provide health care for illegal immigrants, which won't be cheap. And yet with the nation's highest top income tax rate, there are few feasible new sources of revenue.\n\nThe best solution for Los Angeles in this strike would be to emulate New Orleans, which when its public school system failed, decided to convert all its schools to charters. Better still would be vouchers that allow students to attend private schools. Surely anyone who spends five minutes at the DMV or Post Office understands that the private sector does things better than government. Education is no exception. But don't expect common sense to prevail in California.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM CHRISTIAN WHITON
There's a health care reform idea making the rounds and garnering significant attention these days. It is the very plausible sounding Medicare-for-all. Who could argue with expanding a program that America's seniors generally like and indeed have come to rely on? After all, if it's good enough for the grandparents, isn't it good enough for everyone else?\n\nWell, just as not every shiny thing has value when you're panning, this idea truly is fool's gold.\n\nCensus data shows a majority of Americans obtain their health insurance from their employers (56 percent). This is followed by Medicaid (19.3 percent), Medicare (17.2 percent), direct-purchase coverage (16.0 percent), and military coverage (4.8 percent).\n\nTRUMP HAS BROKEN FREE OF OBAMACARE'S GRIP, BUT MORE REFORMS CAN AND MUST BE MADE\n\nIt's important to note that the current Medicare program is not self-sufficient. Payroll taxes collected from workers and employers and all of the premiums paid by those enrolled cover only about half of Medicare's costs. Taxpayers subsidize the rest.\n\nWhen it comes to those with employer-provided health plans, a 2018 survey released by America's Health Insurance Plans shows 71 percent are satisfied with their current coverage. Why then would anyone advocate expanding a program headed for insolvency in 2026 according to the Medicare Board of Trustees, while simultaneously upending the employer provided plans that Americans like?\n\nMedicare-for-all threatens to make the same exact mistake ObamaCare made – expanding health care coverage over controlling health care costs. But think for a moment. Why do millions of Americans, even after years of ObamaCare, still lack health insurance? The answer is simple: It is too expensive.\n\nNumerous experts have estimated the cost of Medicare-for-all, including former Medicare Board of Trustees member Charles Blahous. He estimates the cost to the federal budget at $32.6 trillion. The Urban Institute estimated $32 trillion over10 years as well. Medicare-for-all would double the size of federal government spending. Even a doubling of corporate and individual income taxes would fail to cover its costs.\n\nBut cost is just one issue. Medicare-for-all is mandatory, single-payer national health insurance. There is no opt-out provision, and there are no private health plans, as competition with the government would be illegal. It would replace the Medicare tailored exclusively for seniors with a one-size-fits-all plan that would even wipe out the current and popular Medicare Advantage plans, with enrollees responsible for 20 percent of the cost.\n\nBesides paying more for health care, patients would undoubtedly receive inferior care. Extensive wait times seen in countries like Canada and the U.K. would now be the norm in the U.S. Current wait times in Canada are 47 weeks for neurosurgery, 38 weeks for orthopedic surgery, and 29 weeks for ophthalmology, to name just three.\n\nAnd, with current Medicare payments already 40 percent below private payments, more hospitals would close if this payment scheme were thrust on the entire system. The current physician shortage would worsen as reimbursement rates and pay were capped to control costs. Anyone who ever lived through or read about war time rationing would see a return to the ugly side of an economy of shortages.\n\nMore incremental and market-based approaches are achievable at much less expense, and with the potential to truly control costs, which is the main problem in the U.S. health care system. The Association of Mature American Citizens (AMAC) supports expansion of health savings accounts (HSAs) with their triple tax advantages, more transparency with prescription and medical procedure pricing, and eliminating the middle men when it comes to drug pricing.\n\nAMAC has been a strong advocate of The Good Samaritan Charitable Services Act, which would allow doctors to treat up to 20 patients free of charge (pro bono) in exchange for a small tax deduction (capped at $50). Billions in annual Medicaid costs would be saved, and families would have a doctor/patient relationship rather than using expensive emergency rooms as their primary source of health care.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt's important to have all the facts. Some polls show support for Medicare-for-all. But when those polled are informed of the doubling of taxes required to fund such a scheme, support collapses. No wonder advocates choose not to discuss costs.\n\nJust remember, not everything that is shiny and superficially attractive has value. Or as William Shakespeare put it, All that glitters is not gold.\n\nJeff Szymanski works in political communications for The Association of Mature American Citizens.
On a day when New York's governor did an about-face and embraced mobile sports betting as a way to deal with financial losses stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, a company that tracks gambling legislation and performance predicted that revenue from legal sports betting could reach $3.1 billion in 2021 and as much as $10 billion within five years.\n\nVIXIO GamblingCompliance issued a report Wednesday projecting that at least six and as many as 14 additional states will legalize or expand sports betting in 2021. That fits with projections by numerous analysts that nearly half the country may have legalized sports betting by the end of this year.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nThe company estimated that revenue from sports betting would reach $2.6 billion to $3.1 billion this year, an increase of as much as 100% over the $1.55 billion it estimates will have been generated from sports betting in 2020 (December figures have not yet been reported from most states).\n\nBy 2025, that figure could hit $10 billion, the report said.\n\nSports betting revenue represents money remaining after sportsbooks pay off winning bets and other expenses. It is separate from — and much less than — the total amount wagered on sports, which is called handle. States collect taxes on the amount of money their sportsbooks retain from sports betting, not on the total amount wagered.\n\nThe report came as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo reversed his long-held opposition to mobile sports betting, opening the possibility of a lucrative new market in one of the nation's most populous states. It also could take a big bite out of New Jersey's leading position in the national sports betting market; about 20% of New Jersey's sports bets are placed by New Yorkers crossing the state line.\n\nAt a news conference, the Democratic governor proposed having New York run sports betting operations to maximize tax revenue.\n\nAt a time when New York faces a historic budget deficit due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the current online sports wagering structure incentivizes a large segment of New York residents to travel out of state to make online sports wagers or continue to patronize black markets, he said. New York has the potential to be the largest sports wagering market in the United States, and by legalizing online sports betting, we aim to keep millions of dollars in revenue here at home, which will only strengthen our ability to rebuild from the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nHe called on the New York State Gaming Commission to issue a request for proposals to select and license a sports operator or platform to offer mobile sports wagering in the state.\n\nYaniv Sherman, head of commercial development at 888 Holdings, a sports betting company, welcomed a possible full-scale entrance of New York to the national market.\n\nNew York has always been the critical, strategic and much-anticipated component of any U.S. online gambling agenda, and it represents one of the top three states in terms of economic potential, he said. It's no surprise that this is moving on the back of budget deficits in states like New York, and I think it's a great way of bringing tax dollars from offshore operations to the city and state coffers.\n\nLikewise, Adam Greenblatt, CEO of BetMGM, said his company is eager to enter New York's expanded market, saying Cuomo's move has the potential to bring leaking tax dollars back to New York from offshore books and nearby states.\n\nSara Slane, a gambling analyst and former official with the American Gaming Association, predicted New York quickly would become a top-tier state in the sports betting market.\n\nGov. Cuomo's embrace of mobile sports betting immediately positions New York to soon lead all other states and generate significant revenue for state coffers, she said. New York, with a population of nearly 20 million, dwarfs any other state with legal betting and should have no problem regularly topping $1 billion a month in wagers.\n\nNew York, like most states, expects to have a smoking crater where its budget used to be due to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. That is expected to play a large part in additional states considering or enacting sports betting legislation this year.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe report predicted an aggressive campaign to legalize online sports betting in Texas this year, with team owners allied with DraftKings, FanDuel and BetMGM to press for legalization. That would require a constitutional amendment and a stateside referendum.\n\nIt forecast renewed legislative efforts to enact sports betting in Massachusetts, Georgia, Ohio and North Carolina, among others, while noting that sports betting efforts in Florida and California remain complicated by the impact they would have on tribal gambling operations and rights.
In its common definition, the job of president of the United States is to deliver peace and prosperity. Donald Trump is doing well on both fronts, so let's impeach the bastard!\n\nAs insane as it sounds, that and only that is what many Democrats have in mind. Impeachment, or death by a thousand investigations, is the heart of their plan.\n\nFor proof, eliminate their desire to remove Trump from office and see if you can pinpoint anything else with broad Dem support. Some advocate for open borders, others for tax hikes or Medicare-for-all, but ending the Trump presidency ASAP is the glue holding the party together.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt unites the leadership with the rank and file, including many of the socialist-leaning newcomers. Its migration from the far-out fringe to a daily talking point among party faithful and their national media lapdogs represents a breathtaking development.\n\nThe implications are staggering — and a potential disaster for America.\n\nCLICK HERE TO CONTINUE READING MICHAEL GOODWIN ON THE NEW YORK POST.
A majority of voters support a proposal floated by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to dramatically increase the highest tax rate on the wealthiest Americans to as high as 70 percent.\n\nAround 59 percent of registered voters support the idea, according to a Hill-HarrisX survey, which was conducted Jan. 12-13 after the New York Democrat set off a nationwide debate with her comments on CBS's 60 Minutes that she would support the increase to fund her climate change plan.\n\nThe proposed tax hike would affect those making $10 million or more, she said.\n\nOCASIO-CORTEZ QUESTIONS TRUMP'S WEALTH AFTER PRESIDENTIAL SWIPE\n\nThat doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder you should be contributing more, Ocasio-Cortez said during the interview.\n\nHARRY REID SWIPES AT OCASIO-CORTEZ TAX HIKE PROPOSAL, SAYING AMERICANS WON'T ACCEPT 'RADICAL CHANGE QUICKLY'\n\nWomen supported the proposal by 62-38 percent and men favored it by 55-45 percent, according to the Hill. Southerners back the concept by a 57 to 43 percent margin and 45 percent of Republican voters also viewed it positively.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDuring the 60 Minutes interview, Ocasio-Cortez referenced tax rates returning to levels seen in the 1950s and 1960s, when the richest Americans were taxed at up to 90 percent.
For the first time in prime time since President Trump took office, all eyes are on the Oval Office.\n\nTrump is preparing to deliver his first-ever evening address from the storied room in the White House's West Wing at 9 p.m. ET, amid a protracted partial government shutdown over funding for his proposed southern border wall, Meanwhile, Democratic leaders have been prepping an immediate response, while top Republican senators made clear they don't know exactly what to expect.\n\nWith the nation's second-longest government shutdown in history entering its 17th day and rhetoric reaching an apparent inflection point, media prognosticators and political analysts on Tuesday raised a series of pivotal but unanswered questions. Will some networks choose not to air Trump's speech in full, or attempt to fact-check his statements live?\n\nAnd will Trump, as he has suggested repeatedly in recented days, announce that he will use his emergency powers to build the wall even without congressional funding?\n\nHow will Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi handle their unusual, nationally televised tandem response to Trump's remarks?\n\nThe White House requested eight minutes to make Trump's case on television. It invited representatives from cable news outlets to a White House lunch with Trump ahead of the address, a gesture that is typically reserved for the lead-up to State of the Union speeches.\n\nRegardless of what transpires, negotiations are slated to continue throughout the week to resolve the shutdown, which has furloughed 380,000 federal workers and forced an additional 420,000 to work without pay. On Wednesday, Fox News learned, Trump will head to Capitol Hill for a policy lunch with Senate Republicans. Congressional leaders from both parties have been invited to the White House for a 3 p.m. ET sit-down afterward.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump plans a personal visit to the Mexican border, where his administration says an illegal immigration crisis is worsening by the day.\n\nThe number of illegal border crossings is down from 1.6 million in 2000 to less than 400,000 last year. But the number of families coming over the border has risen sharply, putting a strain on health care and immigration services that came into sharp focus with the deaths of two migrant children in December. Administration figures show that 161,000 family units crossed the border in fiscal 2018, a remarkable 50 percent increase from the year before. Homeland Security officials have also said 60,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border last year, a 25 percent increase.\n\nBORDER CRISIS INTENSIFIES AMID SHUTDOWN: MASSIVE INCREASE IN FAMILY UNITS CROSSED BORDER ILLEGALLY IN 2018\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told Fox News that he doesn't know what Trump will say during his prime-time address. But Graham added that Trump ideally will not use his presidential emergency powers to order the military to construct a border wall, saying that passing a spending bill in Congress is the better way to tackle the issue.\n\nSouth Dakota GOP Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the GOP whip, said he doesn't think the emergency declaration is the right move and that I prefer that we get this resolved the old-fashioned way.\n\nAnd Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-.Ky., who met with Vice President Mike Pencc on Capitol Hill earlier in the day, did not answer when asked by Fox News on Tuesday whether he thought declaring a national emergency would be a good idea. But in a statement and remarks on the Senate floor, McConnell emphasized his support for the White House's aggressive tack.\n\nCAN TRUMP USE EMERGENCY POWERS TO BUILD A BORDER WALL?\n\nIn light of the urgent humanitarian and security crisis on our border, the president is requesting $5.7 billion for physical barriers and border security, McConnell said. For some context, that is just about one tenth of one percent of federal spending. One tenth of one percent -- for physical barriers like the fences and barriers which already exist, which Democrats have previously voted for with enthusiasm.\n\nHouse GOP leaders, after speaking with Pence, Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Tuesday, seemed similarly aligned.\n\nGOP Texas Rep. Mac Thornberry, the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, reiterated to Fox News that he thinks a congressional compromise -- rather than emergency military spending -- is the best way to build the wall.\n\nAnd House Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said the president may take whatever action he needs to fund the wall.\n\nWhite House adviser Kellyanne Conway seemed optimistic, giving a thumbs-up sign to reporters after the meeting.\n\nAfter a sit-down with Democrats over the weekend, the White House issued a series of budget demands, including a new request for $800,000 for humanitarian needs. But mostly Trump still wants his wall, which Democrats describe as immoral as well as no solution to illegal immigration.\n\nIn a pre-emptive move, the White House said Monday that tax refunds would be paid despite the shutdown. That shutdown exemption would break from past practice and could be challenged.\n\nEmphasizing that he's not abandoning his security argument, Trump said in a fundraising email Tuesday: I want to make one thing clear to Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi: Your safety is not a political game or a negotiation tactic!\n\nPelosi, for her part, has also sparred openly with the White House. She reportedly engaged in a tense confrontation with Nielsen on Wednesday in the Situation Room, with the California Democrat interrupting Nielsen's presentation on border security and illegal immigration, telling her I reject your facts.\n\nLeaning on Senate Republicans, some of whom are growing anxious about the impact of the shutdown, Pelosi said the House would begin passing individual bills this week to reopen shuttered federal agencies, starting with the Treasury Department to ensure Americans receive their tax refunds.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile Tuesday night promised to be a historic night and a kind of political prime-time prizefight, television viewers who were hoping to have a less political evening still have options.\n\nIf you're looking for anything even remotely worth watching tonight at 9pm EST, I will be folding laundry in my underwear for 8 minutes on Instagram live, porn star Stormy Daniels, whose protracted legal battle with the president has dominated national headlines, wrote Tuesday afternooon on Twitter.\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram, Alex Pappas, Jason Donner, and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
In these last hours before the Jan. 5 runoff for the U.S. Senate seats in Georgia, I have only one message.\n\nVote as if America depends on it – because it does.\n\nJan. 5 is the most consequential runoff election in American history.\n\nNEWT GINGRICH: MY PREDICTIONS FOR NEXT 10 YEARS — I EXPECT THESE BIG CHANGES\n\nIf Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler win, the Republican majority in the Senate will be empowered to moderate the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris administration. It will be able to stop virtually every radical appointment to government and proposal for legislation.\n\nIf the two radicals, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, win, then Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., will be able, with the help of Vice President Harris (who will serve as president of the Senate), to push through radical appointments and legislation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nFurthermore, the difference in service to Georgia communities between Perdue-Loeffler and Warnock-Ossoff is enormous.\n\nWarnock has already proven he will be attentive to radicals and those in the Black community who agree with him (but not those who disagree with him). However, since Warnock describes people who want to cut taxes as baby killers in the tradition of King Herod, it is difficult to see how he can serve the majority of Georgians, who prefer lower taxes to higher taxes.\n\nSimilarly, Warnock is openly, proudly and noisily for abortion on-demand – even in the ninth month – and for tax-paid abortions. It is hard to see how he is going to reach out and work with the millions of Georgians who are pro-life.\n\nOssoff will clearly be focused more on the San Francisco values of Harris and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., than on the issues that matter to Georgia. Ossoff raises far more money in California than in Georgia. It was no accident that he and Warnock had their first joint fundraiser in a restaurant in San Francisco.\n\nIn fact, both Ossoff and Warnock raise the overwhelming bulk of their money from non-Georgians, and they are clearly the candidates of liberals and radicals across the country.\n\nSymbolically, it was revealing when New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said at his press conference just before Christmas that he could not finalize his city budget (which is more than $3 billion in deficit for this year alone) until the Georgia Senate races were decided. The mayor is hoping an Ossoff-Warnock victory will open the way for New York City to reach into Georgians' wallets to bail out his bankrupt administration.\n\nMake sure every person you know votes on Jan. 5. To boycott the election is to surrender America's future.\n\nBy contrast, we know from six years of Perdue's hard work that he has helped Georgians across the state. In town after town, there are people, companies and causes that Perdue has helped. He fought to cut taxes for every Georgia family. He voted to strengthen and train – not defund – our police officers. He worked to roll back unnecessary and expensive regulations on Georgia's farmers. And he supported the CARES Act to help Georgia fight the COVID-19 epidemic.\n\nSimilarly, it is clear from her first year in office that Loeffler has a clear focus on Georgia. She has been crisscrossing the state helping solve problems and cutting red tape in the federal government to get aid to Georgia communities and businesses. In the Senate, she fought for the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which helped return agriculture and manufacturing jobs to Georgia. She has fought against radical pro-abortion proposals. And her work on the Veterans Affairs Committee has helped ensure Georgia's veterans get the health care they deserve – and the training and education they need to succeed after their military service.\n\nBoth Sens. Perdue and Loeffler have clear records of voting conservative and standing firm for the values of more freedom, more jobs, lower taxes and less bureaucracy. Their records are a clear contrast with the Warnock-Ossuf record of radicalism.\n\nThe choice is clear.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMake sure every person you know votes on Jan. 5. To boycott the election is to surrender America's future.\n\nThe fate of America will be affected by the outcome of this runoff.\n\nYou can – and you must – make a difference.\n\nTo read, hear and watch more of Newt's commentary, visit Gingrich360.com.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM NEWT GINGRICH
Embattled New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio took aim at the city's wealthiest residents on Thursday, calling for taxes that will redistribute the wealth and fund recovery efforts following the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDe Blasio outlined his revitalization plans during his final State of the City address. The mayor argued that higher taxes on the rich would generate revenue to aid an overhaul of a local economy reeling from the pandemic.\n\nWe're going to work constantly for a fairer economy, and that means we must tax the wealthy and we must redistribute the wealth of this city to those who do the work, de Blasio said in the address. Even during the height of the pandemic, we saw the stock market boom. We saw 120 New York billionaires grow their net worth by $77 billion.\n\nDe Blasio called for wealth distribution even as he faces criticism from local business leaders over his handling of the pandemic. Advocates for New York City's restaurant industry and local small businesses have argued that Democratic leaders imposed strict lockdowns and failed to provide adequate support, contributing to hundreds of closures.\n\nProgressive New York lawmakers, including de Blasio and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have repeatedly called for increased taxes on the rich as a means to aid struggling Americans.\n\nEarlier this month, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned the state could raise taxes to address a historic budget crunch without additional federal aid. An estimated 70,000 net residents left New York City from the start of the pandemic in March until last December, costing an estimated $34 billion in lost income, according to a study from analytics firm Unacast.\n\nDe Blasio said his administration would join the fight for higher taxes for the wealthy and a new billionaire's tax, adding that initiatives would give us the resources that can build a recovery for all of us.\n\nAside from his call for higher taxes on the wealthy, de Blasio detailed the launch of a recovery tax credit for small businesses as well as a loan program for entrepreneurs attempting to recover from the pandemic.\n\nHe touted the success of his Open Restaurants program for outdoor dining, which he said allowed the city to bring those restaurants back and save 100,000 jobs. Indoor dining is currently banned in New York City, though it is expected to restart soon.\n\nThe mayor spoke at length about his plans to combat climate change, arguing that New York City has to lead the way in ending the use of fossil fuels. De Blasio pledged to commit $50 billion in city pension resources toward renewable energy investments over the next 15 years while pulling any remaining funding for fossil fuel companies.\n\nNew York City will add two-way bike lanes to the Brooklyn and Queensboro Bridges, add bike boulevards throughout the five boroughs and open more streets to pedestrians and cyclists.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThese are the kinds of changes that allow us to move out of the era of fossil fuels and the era of the automobile and into a green future as part of our commitment to the New York City Green New Deal, de Blasio said.\n\nDe Blasio said New York has set a goal of vaccinating five million city residents by June and of fully reopening schools by September. Additionally, City Hall plans to use federal stimulus funds to create a City Cleanup Corps, which de Blasio likened to a program from former President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program during the Great Depression.\n\nDe Blasio will exit the mayor's office at the end of 2021 due to term limits.
PHILADELPHIA -- Kevin Walter and his wife, Melissa, opened their dream brewhouse in the Callowhill section of Philadelphia less than a year ago. But for the past month they, like other craft brewery owners, have been on edge as the federal government shutdown has turned off the tap for many breweries across the nation.\n\nWithout having our labels approved we can't produce new beer, which means we can't sell new beer, Walter said. And selling new beer is sort of a craft brewers niche, it's what our customers want.\n\nThe shutdown affecting more than 800,000 federal workers has frozen activity for the Treasury Department's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, the government entity that regulates alcoholic beverages.\n\nSENATE PANEL RELEASES TEXT OF BILL TO REOPEN GOVERNMENT, INCLUDED WALL MONEY\n\nSo for more than 30 days, Love City Brewing and roughly 7,000 local and independently owned breweries nationwide have been squeezed – new releases have been placed on hold, interstate shipments have been halted and grand openings pushed back.\n\nNew, now, next is what keeps us going, Walter said.\n\nBob Pease, president of the Colorado-based Brewers Association, a not-for-profit trade association, said the industry cannot afford the squeeze.\n\nThe margin of error is so small for these entrepreneurs that the prospect for economic hardship is likely and may be significant during this shutdown, Pease said.\n\nBrewers are increasingly nervous that they will lose money if brewery openings and seasonal beers are delayed much longer in the dispute over President Donald Trump's demand for a taxpayer-funded wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe shutdown that began Dec. 22 pinches primarily craft brewers, which offer wider varieties of beer and selections that change constantly. The biggest brewers are largely unaffected because they already have government approval for their top national brands.\n\nSMALL BUSINESS BEER DISTRIBUTOR LOSES UPWARDS OF $2K/ DAY OVER GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\nUncertainty is going to cause small and independent breweries to not hire people, cancel seasonal releases, or – even more frightening – lay off workers, said Pease.\n\nAccording to a report by the Brewers Association, small and independent craft brewers account for more than 135,000 jobs in 2017, which is an increase of 6,000 from the previous year. Small and independently owned craft breweries account for 98 percent of all U.S. operating breweries.\n\nPlacing owners like Walter in a bind.\n\nWithout label approval from the treasury department, Love City Brewing can't release new canned beers—a function he said is essential to the business' growth.\n\nIf we can't have a portion of our seasonal product in cans, then it's going to be very difficult for us to compete, Walter said.\n\nThe pain is also being felt across town at Dock Street Brewery in West Philadelphia. A veteran brewhouse known for its outlandish beer formulas, like goat brain-brewed beer that is an ode to the Walking Dead series, has already missed two new launches and may have to reschedule or scrap its entire winter product lineup.\n\nIt's just a shame because it's January and people would maybe like some entertainment to get through the winter, said Marilyn Candeloro, manager of Dock Street Brewery.\n\nCandelora said the formulas have to be approved by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau before the brewhouse can move forward with new labels.\n\nIt's the artist and the printer who would have made the label, the distributor who would have sold the beer and the consumer who would like to drink it, said Candeloro.\n\nBrewers said that even after the shutdown ends, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau could be saddled with a months-long backlog in approval requests.\n\nSmall business is the backbone of America's economy, and brewers are a part of that backbone, Pease said. So for owners not to be able to innovate and live out their dream due to due to difficulties at the federal level – that is just incredibly frustrating.
Mike The Situation Sorrentino has apparently received quite the bit of fan mail after reporting to prison earlier this week.\n\nThe Jersey Shore alum's wife, Lauren Pesce, reached out to her husband's Twitter followers Thursday, thanking them for their show of support.\n\nAnd part of that support has come through the mail as Sorrentino has received thousands of letters, she tweeted.\n\n'JERSEY SHORE' STAR MIKE 'THE SITUATION' SORRENTINO CELEBRATES CHRISTMAS WITH WIFE BEFORE PRISON\n\nMike would like to thank all of his fans worldwide for the unbelievable outpouring of love & support. We speak everyday & he's doing great, Pesce wrote. He's received thousands of letters, he won't be able to respond to everyone but wanted to express his gratitude to each and everyone of you.

We are live from Georgia International Plaza for the battle for\n\nthe Senate.\n\n\n\nTwo runoff races two days from now that will determine the balance of power\n\nin Washington. If both Democrats, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, win,\n\ntheir party will control the House, the Senate, and the White House. If\n\neither Republican Kelly Loeffler or David Perdue is reelected, Mitch\n\nMcConnell would retain control and be able to block much of the Biden\n\nadministration's agenda. A record 3 million Georgians have already cast\n\ntheir votes in these crucial races.\n\n\n\nMeantime, President Trump continues to cast doubt on the legitimacy of\n\nGeorgia's election system after losing the state to Joe Biden. In a moment,\n\nwe'll speak with one of the Republican candidates, incumbent Senator Kelly\n\nLoeffler.\n\n\n\nBut first, to Peter Doocy in Savannah with the closing arguments on the\n\ncampaign trail -- Peter.\n\n\n\nPETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Bret, early voting data shows\n\nRepublicans will need a strong showing north of Atlanta, so that's where\n\nPresident Trump is going tomorrow and Democrats are going to try to run up\n\nthe score in Atlanta, so that's where Joe Biden is going, but first, a\n\nvisit by Kamala Harris here in Savannah.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nOSSOFF: But see, now Georgia has the opportunity to define the next\n\nchapter in American history.\n\n\n\nDOOCY (voice-over): Republican candidates agree, but for different\n\nreasons.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: We're going to show America that Georgia is a red state, we're\n\ngoing to stop socialism and we're going to save this country.\n\n\n\nDOOCY: In one runoff, Republican Kelly Loeffler faces Democrat Raphael\n\nWarnock.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Dangerous, radical Raphael Warnock has not answered for\n\ninvestigations into child abuse, domestic abuse.\n\n\n\nDOOCY: Warnock argues recent allegations are irrelevant.\n\n\n\nWARNOCK: Kelly Loeffler doesn't have a case to make for why she should be\n\nsitting in that seat.\n\n\n\nDOOCY: And the other runoff, the Republican David Perdue, is quarantining\n\nafter her close contact with a COVID-19-infected staffer but still accusing\n\nDemocrat Jon Ossoff of hiding transactions with a business linked to China.\n\n\n\nPERDUE: This is a ripening scandal, as we now know. He -- he is involved\n\nwith the communist Chinese party during his primary.\n\n\n\nDOOCY: Ossoff claims David Perdue is the corrupt one.\n\n\n\nOSSOFF: We have two United States senators who, when they learned about\n\nthe threat that COVID-19 posed to their own constituents, their first call\n\nwas to their broker.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nDOOCY (on camera): Campaigns are trying hard to stick with people that\n\nthey come across. For example, yesterday at a campus launch, organizers\n\nsent volunteers away with this chant. Door knock for Warnock, vote your\n\nOss-off -- Bret.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nBAIER: All right. Peter Doocy reporting from Savannah -- Peter, thanks.\n\n\n\nJoining me here now, Senator Kelly Loeffler.\n\n\n\nGood morning, Senator. Welcome to FOX News Sunday.\n\n\n\nSEN. KELLY LOEFFLER (R-GA): Good morning. Great to be with you, Bret.\n\n\n\nBAIER: We should point out. We invited your opponent, Raphael Warnock, on\n\nas well. He declined.\n\n\n\nThank you for being here.\n\n\n\nIt's a little cold for Atlanta.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: That's okay, it's going to warm up.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yeah, that's right.\n\n\n\nSenator, you've been all over the state since November 3rd. And, you -- we\n\nare now two days from this runoff. As we mentioned, more than 3 million\n\nGeorgians have already voted.\n\n\n\nWhere did you and your team see this race right now?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, Bret, Georgians are fired up. They are ready to get\n\nout and vote on Tuesday because they know the future of the country is on\n\nthe ballot here in Georgia. It's a choice. It's a stark contrast between\n\nthe freedoms, our way of life here in Georgia, or socialism, government\n\ncontrol.\n\n\n\nWe know the agenda of the left because Chuck Schumer told us he was going\n\nto take Georgia and then change America. And we know that radical agenda is\n\nnot just high taxes, open borders, defunding the police, government-run\n\nhealth care. But he has radical candidates in this race, his agents of\n\nchange.\n\n\n\nRadical liberal Raphael Warnock is my opponent. He is someone that would\n\nfundamentally change this country. His values are out of step with Georgia.\n\n\n\nBAIER: We are going to talk about that in a minute.\n\n\n\nAre you worried about Republican turnout because of the current ongoing\n\nchallenge to the election?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, Republicans, Democrats, everyone, they need to know\n\nthat we can trust this process that we are working hard to make sure that\n\nthis is a fair, trusted election. We have 8,000 poll watchers.\n\n\n\nBut from what I've seen as I've crisscrossed the state nonstop over the\n\nlast nine weeks, Georgians are fired up to vote and we've seen that in\n\nearly voting. Three million votes shattering records for previous runoffs\n\nand we know that on Tuesday, just two days away here, we are going to see a\n\nrecord turnout for this runoff election and I'm confident that we will win\n\nif our voters turnout.\n\n\n\nBAIER: This weekend, Senator Ted Cruz campaigned for you. He and ten other\n\nRepublican senators and senators-elect say they will join Senator Josh\n\nHawley in a vote against certifying Electoral College votes if there isn't\n\nan audit of disputed states votes, including this one. Now, you are not on\n\nthat list.\n\n\n\nWhy not?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, I've said from the start, everything is on the table here,\n\nand I'm seriously looking at that. We have to make sure that Georgia and\n\nall of Americans trust our voting process. But my number one objective\n\nright now has to be winning on January 5th so that we can get to the bottom\n\nof what happened in these elections.\n\n\n\nWe know that Democrats will never get to the bottom of it. That's what\n\nwe're fighting here for, and I'm continuing to fight for this president.\n\nHe's fought for us and so we're going to stay on top of that.\n\n\n\nBAIER: So, the president says this election was stolen. In fact, he\n\ntweeted this weekend that because of how the process was done here in\n\nGeorgia, the election, including the Senate run, was, quote, illegal and\n\ninvalid.\n\n\n\nDo you agree with that?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, the president has been very consistent. He came down\n\nto Georgia in December and said you have to get out and vote for David\n\nPerdue and Kelly Loeffler. You have to exercise your right to vote.\n\n\n\nHe's coming back here tomorrow night, to Dalton, Georgia, and he's going to\n\ntell voters the same thing, you have to get out and vote, Georgia, because\n\nthis is too important. The country is on the line. They are counting on us.\n\n\n\nWe won't get a second chance. If we lose this election, we could lose the\n\nfuture of the country because we know Chuck Schumer wants to abolish the\n\nfilibuster, get rid of the Electoral College, have D.C. statehood, raise\n\nour taxes, and the list goes on.\n\n\n\nGeorgians -- that's out of step with Georgia.\n\n\n\nBAIER: But I guess -- and I know you're focused on January 5th, but\n\nJanuary 6th, you have to make that decision. And so, today, can you say\n\nwhether you will certify the Electoral College votes or not, maybe\n\nspecifically from Georgia?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, I'm looking very, very closely at it, and I've been one of\n\nthe first to say, everything is on the table. I'm fighting for this\n\npresident because he's fought for us. He's our president and we are going\n\nto keep making sure that this is a fair election and I'm looking very\n\nclosely at it. But again, none of it matters if I can't win on January 5th.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Right. Well, some of your other Republican colleagues have called\n\nthese overturned election efforts bad for your party, bad for the country.\n\nSenators Romney, Toomey have talked out about it. Senator Toomey releasing\n\na statement about the senator's efforts, Senators Cruz and Hawley.\n\n\n\nThey failed to acknowledge that these allegations have been adjudicated in\n\ncourtrooms across America and were found to be unsupported by evidence. I\n\nacknowledge that this past election, like all elections, had\n\nirregularities, but the evidence is overwhelming that Joe Biden won this\n\nelection.\n\n\n\nIs he right?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, we have every right to take these votes in a way\n\nthat we believe reflects our constituency and our state, and that's what\n\nI'm going to do. I'm going to speak for the people of Georgia.\n\n\n\nBut the worst thing for a party is if David Perdue and I don't win on\n\nTuesday. We have to win because we have to be able to get to that next\n\nstep, to be able to vote our conscience and what is right on January 6th,\n\nand then we have to be able to pursue holding people accountable for how\n\nthese elections were handled.\n\n\n\nBAIER: But have you seen evidence, enough evidence of fraud to overturn\n\nany state's election, as a senator and what you've seen so far?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, certainly, here in Georgia, we have upwards of 200 open\n\ninvestigations. We're in the courts right now. We have heard and seen too\n\nmuch. We need to get to the bottom of it.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBAIER: And, Senator, you know there have been 60-plus court cases that\n\nhave been -- gone before judges, some of them Trump-appointed judges, where\n\nthey haven't found that evidence.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, these cases haven't been heard. They deserve to be heard.\n\nWe need to make sure that we get to the bottom of this because the\n\nintegrity of voting is at the core of our democracy. We have to protect\n\nthat. We have to have people who are willing to fight for it and defend it,\n\nand that's what I'm looking at right now.\n\n\n\nThis is a big decision for the 6th, but I have to stay laser focused on the\n\n5th because if we don't win the 5fth, we will lose the country.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Let's talk about this race, specifically our opponent. On the\n\ncampaign trail when he's pressed about anything that he's -- you know\n\nyou're charging him with, he comes back with pretty much the same attack on\n\nyou. It's very consistent. Take a listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nRAPHALE WARNOCK (D), GEORGIA SENATE CANDIDATE: When she heard about the\n\ncoronavirus pandemic, she got busy making sure that she protected her own\n\nwealth. She is the wealthiest member of Congress. She dumped $3 million\n\nworth of stock, meanwhile telling you there was nothing to worry about.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBAIER: All right, so your response to that? The direct charge that he says\n\nover and over again on the trail?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, this is a political attack that has been completely\n\ndebunked. It's a left-wing media attack, totally debunked and it's a lie.\n\nThe mainstream media continued to carry it and now they've been embarrassed\n\nbecause it's completely debunked.\n\n\n\nBAIER: So it didn't happen?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Absolutely not, and I've proven that over and over. And, look,\n\nthis is a distraction. This is -- the Democrats don't want to answer for\n\ntheir radical policies to change America.\n\n\n\nThe radical agenda of Raphael Warnock and his own -- his own facts are that\n\nhe's been involved in a child abuse investigation that he obstructed. He\n\nwas arrested for obstructing it. He's been involved in a domestic abuse. He\n\nwon't answer those questions.\n\n\n\nThat's what the mainstream media has refused to focus on. That's why I'm\n\nhaving to raise those types of questions and why has he refused to denounce\n\nMarxism and socialism? He refused to do that in our debate. He's attacked\n\nour police officers, calling them gangsters, thugs, and bullies.\n\n\n\nHe said that you can't serve God and the military. He's praised Fidel\n\nCastro, Karl Marx. And Georgians need to know who he is, because he is out\n\nof step with Georgia's values.\n\n\n\nBAIER: A lot of people look at this race and think President Trump may\n\nhave put you in Senator Perdue in a box first when he threatened to not\n\nsign the COVID stimulus and government funding and then he signed it. Then\n\nby after that demanding or calling for additional direct payments, which he\n\nthen supported, and then by vetoing the national defense bill, which you\n\noriginally supported and voted for.\n\n\n\nWhy didn't you vote on the veto override Friday in the Senate?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, I stood with the president 100 percent of the time.\n\nHe's putting America first. He's fought for our men and women in the\n\nmilitary. He restored our strength in our Department of Defense and our\n\nnational security.\n\n\n\nBut, look, I have to be out across the state campaigning to make sure that\n\nGeorgians turn out and vote on January 5th because none of this will matter\n\nif we don't win on the 5th.\n\n\n\nLook, Chuck Schumer has said is going to defund our military by 25 percent.\n\nRaphael Warnock, Jon Ossoff, they would be rubber-stamps for defunding the\n\nmilitary, the police, raising taxes, ushering in government-run health\n\ncare, weakening our Second Amendment rights, opposing or religious freedom.\n\n\n\nThat's all on the ballot here in Georgia, January 5th. That's what I'm\n\nfighting for, is to preserve the future of our country.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Understanding the campaigning is important, if you're saying how\n\nimportant this election is on January 5th, but obviously, Georgia is a big\n\ndefense state, current and former military here, defense business here.\n\n\n\nHow would you have voted had you voted on that veto override?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, I voted to support the NDAA. The bill that came out\n\nof conference was very different from what we've been promised. So, I don't\n\nknow. I was here in Georgia working across the state and I will continue to\n\nstand with our men and women in the military.\n\n\n\nRaphael Warnock will not stand for our military. He's attacked them. He\n\nsaid you can't serve God and serve in the military.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Right, but you would have sustained the veto, the president's veto\n\non the NDAA?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Look, what's at stake here is our military and our freedoms.\n\nThose are what's on the ballot right now.\n\n\n\nI'm the daughter and granddaughter of veterans. We're the fifth largest\n\nstate for veterans and active-duty military here in Georgia. I have fought\n\nfor our military and made sure that we get the funding we need and we are\n\ngoing to continue to do that.\n\n\n\nBut if we don't win on January 5th, our military will be defunded and\n\nworse.\n\n\n\nBAIER: I won't belabor it but that's not a yes or no whether you would\n\nsustain the veto or not.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: That's right.\n\n\n\nBAIER: OK, you're not answering that.\n\n\n\nListen, Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat from West Virginia, has said voters\n\nin this runoff should not be scared that Chuck Schumer will get unlimited\n\npower because Manchin, according to him and maybe others, will not vote to\n\nkill the filibuster.\n\n\n\nWhat do you say to Senator Manchin and others who are saying that?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, we know what Chuck Schumer said. He's going to take\n\nGeorgia and change America. He's told us exactly what he's going to do.\n\nHe's going to make D.C. a state, would have to go Democrat senators, it\n\nwould be impossible for Republicans to win the majority again, he would\n\nabolish the filibuster and the Electoral College. He'd structurally change\n\nthis country, pack the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nMy opponent, radical liberal Raphael Warnock, refused to answer questions\n\nabout court packing because we know that he would pack the court with\n\nliberal justices. So it would overturn the Constitution and the rule of\n\nlaw. It would eliminate our religious freedom, free speech, everything\n\nthat's under attack right now by the left.\n\n\n\nSo we know what's at stake here in Georgia. If we lose this election, we\n\nwon't get a second chance.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Senator, as a senator, you deal with a lot of different things.\n\nThis is an issue that's today. Today is the one-year anniversary of the\n\nU.S. killing Iran's most powerful general, the head of Iran's militias\n\ninside Iraq. It appears according to intelligence that Iran proxy forces\n\nare preparing to carry out more attacks on Americans.\n\n\n\nWhat should the response be if that happens?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, I have stood with this president, the decisions he's\n\nmade to keep America safe, have done that. He's led peace deals for the\n\nfirst time in decades. He stood with Israel, stood against the dangerous\n\nJCPOA, the Iran deal, that shipped pallets of cash to Iran.\n\n\n\nSo we have to continue to be tough, secure our national defense. That's our\n\nfocus and Americans have seen that. We have been kept safe, thanks to this\n\npresident, and I'll continue to support his actions there.\n\n\n\nBAIER: And again, the president in North Georgia tomorrow.\n\n\n\nSenator, you'll be campaigning and we will be her covering it. Thank you\n\nvery much for your time.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Thank you, Bret.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Well, we will have complete coverage Tuesday night.\n\n\n\nUp next, we'll bring in the Sunday panel to discuss what's at stake in\n\nthese runoffs.\n\n\n\nPlus, as we mentioned, a growing number of Trump allies signing on to\n\ncontest the election results -- as FOX News Sunday continues from the\n\nGeorgia International Plaza in downtown Atlanta.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): You've got 74 million people that feel that, A,\n\nmany of them feel they've been disenfranchised, they feel they've not been\n\nheard, and January 6th is the only opportunity that I've got to speak up\n\nfor my constituents in this process.\n\n\n\nSEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): This is just grossly responsible by Senator\n\nHawley, going and undermining even more about public confidence in our\n\ndemocratic process.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBAIER: Republican Senator Josh Hawley on his plans to object to\n\ncertification of the Electoral College votes for Joe Biden on Wednesday and\n\nthen Democrat Senator Chris Van Hollen's slamming those plans.\n\n\n\nIt's time now for our Sunday group. Former Republican Congressman Jason\n\nChaffetz. Catherine Lucey, who covers the White House for The Wall Street\n\nJournal, and FOX News political analyst Juan Williams.\n\n\n\nJason, let me start with you. This is the joint statement from these GOP\n\nsenators and senators-elect. It says Congress should immediately point and\n\nelectoral commission with full investigatory and fact-finding authority to\n\nconduct an emergency ten-day audit of the election returns in the disputed\n\nstates. Once completed, individual states would evaluate the commission\n\n'his findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a\n\nchange in their vote if needed.\n\n\n\nYour thoughts on this move?\n\n\n\nJASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Look, if they're going to ask\n\nCongress whether or not they're going to certify the results, there's no\n\nreason why members can't go out and express their own personal views on it.\n\nThat's the way we do it in this country. We have these types of debates and\n\nI think there are a lot of people in both the Senate and in the House who\n\nare concerned about it.\n\n\n\nNow, I think it's a futile attempt. I don't think it's going to pass, but I\n\ndon't think we should be afraid of the debate in the discussion, because\n\nthere are anomalies and there are things that need to be investigated and\n\nlooked at. And I have respect what these senators and members in the House\n\nare doing.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yeah, Juan, you know, you heard Senator Loeffler not really answer\n\nwhat side she'll be on as far as that vote comes down. But obviously,\n\nAttorney General Bill Barr before he left his position said he did not see\n\nenough widespread fraud to overturn any vote in any state. But the pressure\n\nis still on Trump allies.\n\n\n\nJUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Look, let's just take the\n\nvarnish off this, Bret. This is an effort to overturn an election and as\n\nsuch, it is doing tremendous damage to democracy. Senator Pat Toomey, the\n\nRepublican of Pennsylvania, said the essence of democracy is the people\n\nchoosing their leaders and this is an effort to undermine the people's\n\nright to choose their leadership, and they elected Joe Biden.\n\n\n\nThis is, to me, and effort that really comes down -- you know, it's\n\nshocking. You know, Jason Chaffetz says let's put the evidence out there.\n\nWhy not let people express their opinions and investigate? Well, as you\n\npointed out in your interview with Senator Loeffler, 60 courts, more than\n\n90 judges, many of them Trump-appointed judges, have looked at this and\n\nfound that there is no basis for, in fact, challenging any of these\n\nelection results no matter what small anomalies or irregularities might\n\nhave existed.\n\n\n\nNothing that would change the results of the election, but it does\n\nundermine the incoming Biden administration and it does do damage to the\n\ncredibility of our democracy. This is very serious business. If the\n\nDemocrats were doing this, the Republicans would yell treason.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Catherine, thoughts on this and the politics of this?\n\n\n\nCATHERINE LUCEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, Bret. I think you're\n\nabsolutely right that for a lot of senators, this really has -- and House\n\nmembers -- this has become a political moment as much as anything else.\n\nWhat we are hearing from sources on the Hill is that a lot of these members\n\nare feeling tremendous pressure from their districts, from their\n\nconstituents, from local elected officials that they need to be, you know,\n\ntaking a stand and defending the president and we know the president has\n\nbeen very vocal about his frustration with the outcome, about wanting\n\npeople to challenge it publicly, his frustration with the outcomes in the\n\ncourts.\n\n\n\nAnd so, they are feeling like they need to -- and this is -- this is sort\n\nof turning into a litmus test for your defense for the president and you're\n\nseeing people make calculations around their midterm elections if they are\n\nup then and well as people who are looking ahead to potential runs in 2024\n\nand how this might play for them then.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Jason, you said it's going to be futile and, you know, the votes\n\neventually, they could have a long debate on the floor, but January 6th\n\neventually is going to lead to inauguration on January 20th. As it's\n\nwritten right now, the president doesn't seem to be tweeting that.\n\n\n\nCHAFFETZ: Well, again, I do believe it's futile. I don't think it will go\n\nthere, but I think the nation, having a debate -- because there are\n\nmillions of people who do not believe that the process ultimately was fair\n\nand honorable in the way it was discharged, and so why can't they express\n\nthat? Why can't we have that debate in this country?\n\n\n\nI don't like the idea that they want to just shut down the debate and say,\n\nyou know, just go exactly the way you're supposed to go. It's okay for us\n\nas a nation for a few hours to have this debate. Ultimately I don't think\n\nit will pass.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Well -- here's what Senators Romney and Toomey and others are\n\nsaying and you just heard it from Juan, is that the way to debate this is\n\nin court and the Trump campaign tried in more than 60 courts to do this and\n\nthe substance of it even in front of Trump judges never lead to any one\n\njudge saying there was enough evidence to overturn that state's votes.\n\n\n\nCHAFFETZ: But there is a reason why -- this question goes before Congress\n\nand that's part of the -- this is what's amazing about the United States of\n\nAmerica. It's what separates him from all the other nations on the Earth.\n\nThey actually posed this question to Congress.\n\n\n\nAnd so, each member gets to vote how they want to vote and if they want to\n\nobject, they can object. That's how we do things in this country. It's not\n\njust the courts that decide this. Congress has a role in this as well.\n\n\n\nBAIER: All right. So, Juan, for Trump supporter's who say, listen, we do\n\nthink that there is something fishy here, how politically are Republicans\n\ngoing to keep all of them ahead of this Georgia runoff on the 5th and to\n\ncome out and vote and what they consider really a crucial moment for the\n\nparty?\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: I guess it's just got to be loyalty to President Trump at this\n\njuncture and it's ironic that the president over the weekend as you\n\nmentioned earlier has said he considers this election illegal and invalid.\n\n\n\nWell, if that's the case, why bother to vote? Why support, you know, sort\n\nof an extra-legal corrupt exercise? Why would anybody go out and vote? I\n\ndon't get it.\n\n\n\nBut he's going there tomorrow to campaign and I guess you just have to say\n\nas we heard in your interview with Senator Loeffler, she is just loyal to\n\nPresident Trump. She doesn't have her own agenda. She didn't lay out any\n\nagenda with regard to any issue. Back and forth with regard to the stimulus\n\nspending, not willing to answer with regard to supporting the president's\n\nveto of the defense appropriation, which was overridden by her fellow\n\nRepublicans.\n\n\n\nSo, it's just about Trump at this juncture and I think that when we look at\n\nthe effort that's going to take place in the Senate, again, it's about\n\nRepublicans who are early entries into the 2024 GOP primary. I don't think\n\nthose people are loyal to Trump, obviously, because they are preparing to\n\nchallenge him in 2024, but they are making a play for the base that you're\n\ntalking about, Bret, and saying to that base I'll buy into the conspiracy\n\ntheories, I'll support your doubts and your cynicism about American\n\npolitics when it doesn't go our way.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yeah, Senators Loeffler and Perdue are hoping the president can\n\ntake those supporters across the finish line for the 5th.\n\n\n\nPanel, stand by if you would. We'll see a little bit later in the show.\n\n\n\nComing up, we talked to Hakeem Jeffries with the Democratic caucus about\n\nwhat the next Congress will look like and Speaker Pelosi's chances.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBAIER: Coming up, debate over increased stimulus checks makes for strange\n\nbedfellows.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Trump is right in saying that's not enough. We\n\nneed to go to $2,000. I didn't say he was visionary. He's right on this\n\nissue.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBAIER: We'll ask Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries where the relief\n\nchecks stand next.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: We're back now in Atlanta.\n\n\n\nThis afternoon in Washington, the 117th Congress gets sworn in and\n\nlawmakers in the House will elect their new speaker. Nancy Pelosi, who has\n\nserved 17 years as the Democrat's leader, is running unopposed, but her\n\npath to victory is a narrow one.\n\n\n\nJoining us now from D.C., one of the top Democrats in the house, Hakeem\n\nJeffries.\n\n\n\nCongressman, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.\n\n\n\nREP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY) Good morning. Happy New Year.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yes, Happy New Year to you.\n\n\n\nWhat do you say to voters here in Georgia who say, listen, we think divided\n\ngovernment works better. And, frankly, they say they're scared of a senator\n\n-- Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, your party controlling all the\n\nHouse, Senate, and the White House, and progressives having control of the\n\nlegislative agenda? What do you say to those voters?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Well, those very same Georgia voters saw fit to elect Joe Biden\n\nis the next president of the United States of America, believing that he\n\nhas the heart and the experience and the compassion and the empathy to\n\naddress the challenges that are facing everyday Americans.\n\n\n\nJoe Biden will be the leader of the Democratic Party. More importantly, as\n\nthe next president of the United States, Joe Biden, as he has indicated, is\n\ngoing to be the president for all Americans, both those who voted for him\n\nand those who didn't.\n\n\n\nAnd here in the House, we look forward to working closely with him, as well\n\nas Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans to get things done on behalf of\n\nthe American people.\n\n\n\nBAIER: As I mentioned at the top, Speaker Pelosi is running unopposed for\n\nthat speakership, but how many votes in the House do you think Nancy Pelosi\n\nwill lose?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Well, Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the United States\n\nHouse of Representatives and I look forward to placing her name into\n\nnomination as part of my responsibilities as chair of the House Democratic\n\nCaucus. There is incredible enthusiasm for Speaker Pelosi because she's\n\ndone the work and she's been an historic, legendary legislative leader\n\nthrough incredibly turbulent times. We've been through a lot of trials and\n\ntribulations as Americans. Nancy Pelosi, as speaker of the House, has\n\nhelped to guide us through that and we look forward to her continuing in\n\nthat capacity.\n\n\n\nBAIER: You said Joe Biden is going to be the leader of the party, but how\n\ndoes Nancy Pelosi control the left part of your caucus, the progressives,\n\nand steer legislation through the House with a much more narrow path\n\nbecause of the votes that you have?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Well, we are a very big family in terms of the House Democratic\n\nCaucus. We are a diverse family. We're an enthusiastic family. We believe\n\nin the House that our charge is to reflect the hopes, the dreams, the\n\naspirations, the passions of the American people that's consistent with the\n\nUnited States Constitution. And Speaker Pelosi understands that a big tent\n\napproach to getting things done on behalf of the American people is\n\nincredibly important.\n\n\n\nWe've taken that approach, not just internally, but externally over the\n\nlast several years. We've worked closely with President Trump on issues\n\nlike criminal justice reform, with the passage of the historic First Step\n\nAct. We worked closely with President Trump with respect to the United\n\nStates Mexico Canada trade agreement, which was an historic trade agreement\n\nthat protected good paying American jobs. We worked closely with President\n\nTrump to end the practice of surprise billing on behalf of the American\n\npeople and we continue to stand with President Trump, for instance, as he\n\npushes for $2,000 direct stimulus payments.\n\n\n\nAnd so we're always going to govern, not in a partisan way, but in a\n\npractical way that gets things done on behalf of the American people. That\n\napplies to the House Democratic Caucus. That applies to the House. That\n\napplies to the Senate. That applies to the presidency, whether it's a\n\nRepublican or a Democrat.\n\n\n\nBAIER: It's interesting that you point out all of the things that you --\n\nthe House worked with President Trump. There is also a new rules package\n\nfor the new Congress and in it Democrats widen their subpoena and\n\ninvestigative powers, essentially forecasting that this is going to lead to\n\n-- there's also a rules change about gender-neutral terms, he or she\n\nwould become member or delegate or resident commissioner. Father\n\nand mother would become parent, while brother and sister would\n\nbecome sibling.\n\n\n\nAre these the things that are the priority going after the Trump\n\nadministration in investigations and changing the way people talk about\n\ngender-neutral terms?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Well, the top priority of House Democrats is going to be to crush\n\nthe virus, continue to provide direct assistance to everyday Americans who\n\nare struggling and ultimately supercharge our economy for the good of\n\neveryone. I know that will be a priority of President Biden in his first\n\n100 days. That will continue to be our focus.\n\n\n\nThis is a once in a century pandemic. It requires a once in a century\n\ncontinuing, comprehensive and compassionate congressional response. And so\n\nthat's going to be our focus as we move forward. That has been our focus\n\nover the last year, and that continues until we can put this deadly\n\npandemic behind us.\n\n\n\nBAIER: OK. Then why expand the subpoena investigative powers?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Well, the House is a separate and co-equal branch of government\n\nat the end of the day. We don't work for any president, whether that's a\n\nDemocrat or a Republican, whether it's Donald Trump or Joe Biden. And we\n\nhave a constitutional responsibility to serve as a check and balance on any\n\nexecutive branch.\n\n\n\nI wouldn't interpret any change in rules as an effort to look backward with\n\nrespect to Donald Trump's presidency.\n\n\n\nWhen we felt it was the right thing to do, consistent with our\n\nconstitutional responsibilities to hold this president accountable, we took\n\nthat step. But as we move forward, I think our concern is going to be\n\nfocused on kitchen table, pocketbook issues, dealing with the health care\n\nchallenges of the American people, making sure that we can bring good\n\npaying jobs, prosperity in every single zip code I think should be our\n\nguiding principle. And, of course, working closely with Joe Biden and\n\nKamala Harris to build back better for the people.\n\n\n\nBAIER: And then the rule about changing -- imposing more gender-neutral\n\nlanguage, I guess critics would say that this is not the message from the\n\nelection. Democrats lost a number of seats that they were thinking they\n\nwere going to win. Traditionally, you know, there would be critics that say\n\nthey're -- Democrats are too focused on political correctness and that this\n\nis an example of that. How would you respond to that?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: This is just an example of making sure that we are as inclusive\n\nas possible. You know, the framers of the Constitution envisioned the House\n\nat the institution that was the closest to the people and, in their words,\n\nthat would reflect the passions of the American people. It's the reason why\n\nwe have two-year terms as opposed to four years of the presidency, six\n\nyears in the Senate, life tenure for the Supreme Court. And so I think that\n\nthe rules should reflect our values as an institution that is the most\n\ninclusive as possible, that reflects the gorgeous mosaic in every possible\n\nway of the American people.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Speaker Pelosi, you mentioned the stimulus checks and the direct\n\npayment. She has characterized direct payments to Americans different ways,\n\nbeginning with the direct payments from the Trump tax cuts, then the\n\nnegotiated stimulus deal that she negotiated at first and then this new\n\neffort to get more direct payments.\n\n\n\nTake a listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nREP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): In terms of the bonus that corporate America\n\nreceived versus the crumbs that they are giving to workers to kind of put\n\nthe schmooze on is so pathetic.\n\n\n\nI would like them to have been bigger, but they are significant and they\n\nwill be going out soon.\n\n\n\nWho is holding up that distribution to the American people? Mitch McConnell\n\nand the Senate Republicans.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBAIER: Congressman, there's a lot to digest there. The $1,000 direct\n\npayment was crumbs. $600 was significant. And then the $2,000 was being\n\nheld up by the Senate. But she negotiated with Secretary Mnuchin and\n\nSenator McConnell for that original stimulus deal.\n\n\n\nSo people looking at that scratch their heads.\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: The most important thing that Speaker Pelosi indicated is that\n\nMitch McConnell is holding up direct payment checks that are more robust to\n\nthe American people. We agree with President Trump. Republicans in the\n\nHouse of Representatives agree that we should increase those direct\n\npayments to $2,000 per American because the American people are hurting in\n\na tremendous way.\n\n\n\nNow, when it comes to the tax cuts from 2017, we all, on the Democratic\n\nside, had a big problem with that because we went into $2 trillion worth of\n\ndebt for tax cuts were 83 percent of the benefits went to the wealthiest 1\n\npercent, to the wealthy, the well-off and the well-connected. That was not\n\ngood public policy in my humble opinion.\n\n\n\nI think, at the current moment, what we need to do is make sure that we're\n\nproviding relief to middle-class Americans, to those who aspire to be part\n\nof the middle class, to working families, to the poor and the sick and the\n\nafflicted, those who have been impacted the most by this pandemic. That's\n\nwhat we're trying to do. And we're asking Mitch McConnell to join the\n\nAmerican people, join President Trump, join House Democrats and many House\n\nRepublicans in getting this done.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Congressman, thank you for your time. Thanks for joining us on this\n\nholiday weekend. Happy New Year.\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Thank you. Happy New Year, again, to you and your viewers.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Up next, we'll discuss how the incoming Congress will work with the\n\nBiden administration when the panel returns as we count down to the\n\ncritical Georgia runoffs from Atlanta.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. JIM INHOFE (R-OK): People are talking about the Democrats and\n\nRepublicans don't do things together. This has been an example of what can\n\nhappen in government.\n\n\n\nSEN. JACK REED (D-RI): We provide for the support of our service men and\n\nwomen and their families. Think about them and their families and you'll\n\nappreciate, I think, more of what they do every day.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBAIER: Senate Armed Services Chair James Inhofe and Ranking Member Jack\n\nReed on the New Year's Day override of President Trump's veto of the\n\ndefense spending bill.\n\n\n\nAnd we're back with our panel.\n\n\n\nCatherine, that veto override was a moment of bipartisanship. We heard\n\nSenator Loeffler not really answer that question, what she would do about\n\nthat vote. Neither Loeffler or Perdue voted for that veto override.\n\n\n\nAs you look to Georgia, how significant is that, or is it more about\n\ncontrol of the U.S. Senate and how that plays here?\n\n\n\nCATHERINE LUCEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, it was interesting, Bret,\n\nhow senator Loeffler was very careful to avoid that question. She,\n\nobviously, is focused on the runoff and the fact that they need President\n\nTrump to come and help them get voters out for Election Day. Republicans\n\nknow that they're at a deficit in early voting and they really need a huge\n\nturnout for Election Day.\n\n\n\nI think a thing to think about also with that override is obviously it was\n\na notable moment in President Trump's tenure. It's the first time we've\n\nseen that. And it does speak to the fact that even as, you know, a lot of\n\nsenators are lining up to support his efforts to, you know, contest the\n\nelection results and are, you know, a growing number are looking to do\n\nthat, that there are still moments in which his party is prepared to buck\n\nhim. And this -- obviously, this is a long-standing, you know, bipartisan\n\npiece of legislation. They take a lot of pride in. They're very concerned\n\nabout support for the military and this was one of those moments.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Jason, depending on how Tuesday comes out here and control of the\n\nSenate, either way we're going to see Washington operate differently after\n\nJanuary 20th.\n\n\n\nJASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER CONGRESSMAN (R-UT) AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes,\n\nthe margins are so razor-thin, both in the Senate -- you have one or two\n\nsenators going one direction or another. That changes the equation. And\n\neven in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi has the run of her life\n\nto run the gauntlet today. I don't know that she can actually get there,\n\nbut she probably will. History shows that she pulls that off. But every\n\nsingle vote is going to come down to four or five people to sway that and\n\nreally be in a power position to try to negotiate something else.\n\n\n\nI think Washington's going to have a very difficult time moving legislation\n\nif the Senate goes to the Republicans' hands. That's the best conservative\n\nmove we can have is to elect the two Republican senators in Georgia.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Does that suggest, Jason, that if you were still in Congress, that\n\nthere would be -- you would try to make an effort to work with moderates to\n\nget legislation through if you're dealing with the Biden administration? I\n\nmean is -- is that what we're going to see, a kind of a rise of the\n\nmoderates?\n\n\n\nCHAFFETZ: If there were any moderates left. I think most of the moderates\n\nactually lost. I think the progressive far radical left side of the party\n\nhas taken that over. I think the AOCs, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the\n\nsquad, and more left-leaning members have really got Nancy Pelosi over the\n\nbarrel. I think you're going to see the House of Representatives, under\n\nNancy Pelosi, further to the left than we've ever seen.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Juan, paint the picture of the two different results of Tuesday and\n\nhow Washington operates if the Republicans hold on and win one of the two\n\nand McConnell stays Senate majority leader or if Democrats pick up two and\n\nits Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n\n\nJUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think that Mitch\n\nMcConnell is a shrewd tactician, Bret, and his goal will be to block much\n\nof what Joe Biden and the Democrats, especially as they paint it, you know,\n\nthese radical Democrats want to do. So if -- if McConnell maintains hold of\n\nthe gavel as the Senate majority leader, look for that. I think he may have\n\nto make some concessions, as you were suggesting, dealing with moderates\n\nbecause his margins are smaller.\n\n\n\nOn the House side, I think that's also the case.\n\n\n\nNow, you know, Nancy Pelosi, we were talking earlier about whether or not\n\nshe'll be the next speaker. I think the only question today is whether or\n\nnot enough Democrats are able to come in a day early to vote for her. But\n\nshe has proven to be very tough, able to go toe-to-toe with McConnell, even\n\nwith Trump, and I think hold that caucus together, which also will be a\n\nvery slim Democratic majority, much as McConnell will have a slimmer\n\nRepublican majority in the Senate.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yes, Catherine, I mean that's a key point. In the House it's going\n\nto be tight for any -- really any piece of legislation. Four members\n\nshifting could change the dynamic for the majority.\n\n\n\nLUCEY: That's right. It's very tight. And I think a look to, as we move\n\nforward is, you know, for the president-elect, Joe Biden really ran on the\n\nidea that he's someone who understands The Hill, he can work there, he has\n\nrelationships, you know, on both sides of the aisle. He and Pelosi go back\n\na very long way.\n\n\n\nBut he's also laid out an ambitious agenda of things he would like to do,\n\nyou know, around climate change, around immigration, around tax cuts -- you\n\nknow, taxes. So how he's going to do that with these narrow majorities and\n\nparticularly if they do not win back the majority in the Senate, it remains\n\nto be seen.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yes,\n\n\n\nAnd, finally, Jason, what do you think Tuesday comes down to here?\n\n\n\nCHAFFETZ: Turn out. I don't think there's anybody that's undecided. I think\n\nRepublicans have given a mixed message. Hey, the system is corrupt, but get\n\nout and vote. Donald Trump has got to deliver on Monday night. Republicans\n\nhave to show up. If Republicans show up, I think they will win and the --\n\nthe wildcard in all this are the libertarians. One hundred thousand\n\nlibertarians in the presidential election, which direction do they go? Do\n\nthey show up and vote? Voter turnout is everything.\n\n\n\nBAIER: But does the disaffected election challenge voter not show up\n\nbecause they're angry?\n\n\n\nCHAFFETZ: I think that's the big threat. I think that's the mixed message.\n\nI think that's been the unfortunate part of the message coming out. You've\n\neven had key Trump supporter is going out there and saying don't vote. But\n\nthat's the exact opposite of what needs to happen. It's one of the big\n\nconcerns. It has been a mixed message, but people need to get out and vote.\n\nEvery vote will count. It's going to be a razor-thin margin one way or the\n\nother.\n\n\n\nBAIER: All right, panel, thank you. We'll cover it all. We'll see you next\n\nSunday.\n\n\n\nUp next, our Power Player of the Week. Alan Alda played a wise guy on the\n\nTV series M*A*S*H. Now he's sharing some wisdom in a fascinating second\n\nact.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBAIER: Well, he brought laughter to generations as Hawkeye Pierce on the TV\n\nclassic M*A*S*H. Now he's bringing his lifelong passions for science and\n\ncommunication to his hit podcast.\n\n\n\nHere's Chris Wallace with his Power Player of the Week.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nALAN ALDA, ACTOR AND PODCASTER: What we really need now, more effective\n\ncommunication, not only about COVID, but we need to communicate with each\n\nother better about the things we value.\n\n\n\nI have no idea what I'm doing, I'm just a TV doctor.\n\n\n\nI like to think of you as (ph) people.\n\n\n\nCHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (voice over): Alan Alda has been\n\ncommunicating brilliantly for 84 years now.\n\n\n\nALDA: Please, please, you're too kind.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: As Hawkeye Pierce on the legendary TV show M*A*S*H, he gave\n\nvoice to a generation questioning authority.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not through here.\n\n\n\nALDA: Then we'll disregard the rumor.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Now he's teaching scientists how to share their discoveries with\n\nthe rest of us.\n\n\n\nALDA: I think to a great extent our lives depend on whether or not we\n\nunderstand the science that's being delivered to us and whether we trust\n\nthe people who are talking with us.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: A decade ago he founded the Alda Center for Communicating Science\n\nat Stony Brook University and he found his improv skills as an actor\n\ntranslate to this very different stage.\n\n\n\nALDA: You're not just reciting a lecture at somebody, you're actually\n\ntalking to them. You're -- you're -- you're speaking to them the way you\n\nwould to a -- to a friend.\n\n\n\nI hope you get a chance to listen to my new podcast.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: This passion for communicating also led Alda to start a hit\n\npodcast, now in its ninth season.\n\n\n\nALDA: I have conversations with people who are, many of them, icons in the\n\nculture, but it's all conversation.\n\n\n\nWALLACE (on camera): What is the secret to communicating?\n\n\n\nALDA: You know, ironically, I think the secret to good communication is\n\nlistening.\n\n\n\nWALLACE (voice over): Alda has embraced tech and social media and talks\n\nopenly about how he's now dealing with Parkinson's disease.\n\n\n\nWALLACE (on camera): I understand that your staff has a nickname for you.\n\n\n\nALDA: They call me the world's oldest millennial.\n\n\n\nWALLACE (voice over): Of course for most of us, Alan Alda will always be\n\npart of that unruly gang on M*A*S*H. One hundred and six million people\n\nwatched the 1983 finale, still a record for a scripted show.\n\n\n\nALDA: I look back with amazement, people who we way not born yet when we\n\nwent off the air, are writing to me and telling me that -- how much it\n\nmeans to them.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Almost 50 years later, the bonds among the cast remains strong.\n\n\n\nALDA: There's a kind of funny video that I posted of me showing Mike\n\nFarrell, who I acted with on M*A*S*H, how to download the podcast.\n\n\n\nALDA: There it is. There it is.\n\n\n\nMIKE FARRELL, ACTOR: Alan Alda.\n\n\n\nALDA: And he slowly gets it.\n\n\n\nALDA: Now I'm subscribing to Clear and Vivid.\n\n\n\nFARRELL: I'm subscribed.\n\n\n\nALDA: I'm so excited.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Last year, Alda posted an old video that went viral, of him tap\n\ndancing with his granddaughter.\n\n\n\nWALLACE (on camera): How do you feel about your life these days and what's\n\nyour attitude going forward?\n\n\n\nALDA: I plan to keep figuring out what's -- what's worth doing and having\n\nfun and laughing right up until the last. This just occurred to me, you'll\n\nnever be able to quote my last words because I hope it will be a laugh.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nBAIER: I hope so.\n\n\n\nIn October, Alda launched a spin-off of his popular podcast called Science\n\nClear and Vivid.\n\n\n\nNow a program note.\n\n\n\nBe sure to tune into our coverage of the Georgia election runoffs.

It's past time for the media to begin asking President Obama tough questions about the IRS conservative targeting scandal. After all he was involved, publicly, from the beginning.\n\nLast Friday, the American Center for Law and Justice (where I serve as Chief Counsel) filed its Second Amended Complaint against the United States, the IRS, and a legion of IRS officials. This Complaint, in which we represent 41 organizations in 22 states, presents perhaps the most complete story yet of the IRS conservative targeting scandal.\n\nAnd it is an ugly story indeed.\n\nWhat was sold to the American public as a low-level scandal perpetrated by a few rogue employees – a scandal stopped after senior officials became aware and asserted control – is now (to borrow a Watergate phrase) no longer operative.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nInstead, we detail a long-running assault on the Tea Party, beginning shortly after its emergence in 2009, that is empowered, encouraged, and orchestrated not only by senior IRS officials in Washington, but also through outright targeting by the White House, Congressional Democrats, and the mainstream media.\n\nIn fact, the IRS was doing little more than focusing its attention exactly where the president of the United States told it to focus – on the groups the president himself identified as a threat to democracy.\n\nConsider President Obama's aggressive public statements – made just as we now know senior IRS officials were intentionally and aggressively scrutinizing conservative groups' applications for tax exemption.\n\nOn August 9, 2010 the president warned of attack ads run by shadowy groups with harmless-sounding names during his weekly radio address. The President said: We don't know who's behind these ads and we don't know who's paying for them . . . you don't know if it's a foreign controlled corporation. ... The only people who don't want to disclose the truth are people with something to hide.\n\nOn September 16, 2010, President Obama once again warned that some unidentified foreign-controlled entity could be providing millions of dollars for attack ads. Less than one week later, he complained that nobody knows the identities of the individuals who support conservative groups.\n\nOn September 22, 2010, President Obama warned of groups opposing his policies pos[ing] as non-for-profit social and welfare trade groups and he claimed such groups were guided by seasoned Republican political operatives and potentially supported by some unidentified foreign controlled entity.\n\nOn October 14, 2010, President Obama called organizations with benign sounding names a problem for democracy; the next week he complained about individuals who hide behind those front groups, called such groups a threat to our democracy, and claimed such groups were engaged in unsupervised spending.\n\nNext, consider the IRS's actions following those statements. Not only did the IRS continue its targeting, it issued broad questionnaires that made unconstitutionally-intrusive inquiries designed to get answers to exactly the questions President Obama posed.\n\nWho are your donors?\n\nWhat is the political activity of your family and associates?\n\nWhat are the passwords for your websites?\n\nAfter all, according to the president, you're only afraid to answer these questions if you've got something to hide.\n\nThe demagoguery is breathtaking. Not only does he raise the wholly-unsubstantiated possibility of shadowy foreign involvement in the Tea Party groups, a charge incredible on its face, but he goes the extra mile of calling such groups, a threat to our democracy.\n\nWhen the president of the United States declares these groups a threat to our democracy is it any surprise that his enthusiastic supporters (and donors) within the IRS responded with an unprecedented campaign of selective targeting, intimidation, and governmental intrusion?\n\nOne grows weary of stating the obvious, but if President Bush had declared a specific category of citizen groups a threat to democracy potentially run by political operatives or foreign-controlled, and the IRS launched an unprecedented campaign of targeting and intrusive questioning, the mainstream media would have been relentless not only in its independent investigations but in its calls for accountability – at the highest levels.\n\nWas the president of the United States involved in the IRS scandal? He was the one who identified the targets – in the most public manner possible.\n\nA president singling out citizens groups for targeting and intrusive questioning merely because he dislikes their message and fears their political influence?\n\nNow that is a threat to democracy.
