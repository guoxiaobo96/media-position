But the elite nature of a budget reconciliation package prohibits senators from gumming up the works at either stage. It takes a mere simple majority to approve amendments and adopt the final product. In fact, senators may only make points of order (suggesting that the Senate isn't operating properly) to certain amendments or other provisions in the package and then vote to waive the Budget Act.

Some examples include whether a provision cuts or raises taxes or revenues, adds to the deficit or isn't related to budgetary matters.

{"original": "It's official. By executive fiat, President Obama will grant amnesty to up to 5 million immigrants living illegally in the United States.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "How did we get here? Didn't the president say, even last year, that he couldn't, and wouldn't take executive action on immigration?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If Obama ever finds himself in a court of law, he would surely be advised to invoke the Fifth Amendment. He is prone to contradiction and tends to be a good witness against himself.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Consider his self-incriminating statements on immigration and executive powers. A year ago, when asked if he had the authority to end deportations of illegal aliens he said, Actually, I don't. Three years earlier, when pressed as to why he could not act on his own on immigration he said, The notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Well, now the president says it is true -- he can alter the laws unilaterally. Why the metamorphosis? What changed? The law and the Constitution are still the same. Which leaves Obama. When it comes to the truth, inconvenient or otherwise, he is a chameleon like no other politician. He never hesitates to contradict himself, conjuring a new breadth of hypocrisy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "President Obama's favorite justification for his executive action is that Congress failed to act. No, Mr. President, Congress did not fail to act, it chose not to act in granting amnesty.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There is a difference. A determination not to act is, by itself, a deliberate act. This is how the framers constructed our system of government. Congress considers and debates a great many bills. Not all of them pass. This is not failure in the conventional sense, but decision by declination. It constitutes a prudent and calculated process.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But the president uses this contrived failure as a pretext to arrogate the authority of another branch of government. He wields his pen to legislate by executive decree. He well knows he is exceeding his power. In 2011, he said, I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the (immigration) on my own. But that's not how our system works. That's not how our democracy functions. That's not how our Constitution is written. He was right. It was a rare moment of clarity for a man who fancies himself a constitutional scholar.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, however, by granting legal status to roughly half the nation's population of illegal immigrants, Obama is twisting the law, ignoring the Constitution, and forsaking his primary responsibility as chief executive. For years, he argued publicly it would be unconstitutional for him to take such action because he said, I'm president, I'm not king. Apparently, he now favors a crown on his noggin. In truth, he is king of self-confutation, negating himself with his own words.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Recently, when asked why he disagreed with himself, the president insisted, Well, actually, my position hasn't changed. After the laughter died down, the Washington Post Fact Checker gave Obama an upside-down Pinocchio for his tortured denial of a blatant flip-flop.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The president's executive action to legalize illegals by nullifying existing law, constitutes a stunning abuse of office: usurping the power of Congress, while abdicating his duty to uphold and enforce the laws. Here are three ways this is happening:", "augmented": []}
{"original": "President Obama claims he is entitled to overhaul immigration laws in the name of prosecutorial discretion. It is one of those wonderfully fungible phrases in the law. Elastic because it is vague and ambiguous. Useful because it can be easily abused. Mr. Obama has appropriated this doctrine to argue he has near boundless discretion to amend, revise, waive or suspend the execution of immigration laws. As chief executive, he is empowering himself to decide what laws may be enforced or ignored and what persons may come or go across our southern border irrespective of what the law actually states.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In past decisions, the U.S. Supreme Court has cautioned the executive branch that its prosecutorial discretion, while broad, is not unfettered. It is subject to restrictions. The doctrine may not be used to adopt a sweeping policy of non-enforcement of the law. It applies only to decisions not to prosecute or expel specific individuals or small groups of people, typically for exigent reasons like war, civil unrest or political persecution.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "By contrast, President Obama is bestowing a wholesale, blanket amnesty for an entire class of nearly 5 million people. He is doing so not for the reasons allowed by law, but for purposes that appear to be purely political. This is a flagrant abuse of prosecutorial discretion. His expansive action exceeds his authority in ways that none of his predecessors ever envisioned. And it is a radical departure from any of the executive actions issued by previous presidents.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It is true that President Ronald Reagan utilized executive action in 1987 to grant a limited deportation reprieve to certain spouses and young children of immigrants. But his action was a logical and direct extension of, not a departure from, an existing amnesty law Congress had already passed. His exemption and a subsequent extension by his successor, President George H. W. Bush, were later incorporated into a new law passed by Congress. The point is instructive. The actions by Reagan and Bush are not a supporting precedent for Mr. Obama, but an important limiting principle of presidential authority.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "However, President Obama has commandeered this elastic doctrine of prosecutorial discretion and stretched or manipulated it beyond all recognition and reason. It has become his political Gumby toy with which he exerts his will whenever he fails to get his way with Congress. He contorts the word discretion to adopt a capacious policy -- his own policy -- to ban full enforcement of a duly enacted immigration statute. He treats the doctrine as a magical incantation shielding his arbitrariness.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Our Constitution clearly delineates a separation of powers. Congress is vested with writing laws and the President is charged with executing those laws. This is especially true when it comes to immigration.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "At the end of the 19th century, the Supreme Court declared that Congress had plenary power (meaning full and complete) to regulate immigration. Derived from Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, the doctrine is based on the concept that immigration is a question of national sovereignty, relating to a nation's right to define its own borders and restrict entrance therein. As the high court observed, Over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Yet President Obama has decided to usurp this power by unilateral directive, unconstrained by established checks and balances. In so doing, he is granting himself extra-constitutional authority and upsetting the carefully balanced separation of powers. He is also subverting the nucleus of our constitutional design: the rule of law.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "President Obama's decision that existing laws shall not be enforced against some 5 million illegal immigrants violates his sworn constitutional duty. Article II, Section 3 requires that the President shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. Nowhere is it written that the chief executive is granted the latitude to pick and choose which laws he wants to enforce. He cannot ignore or nullify laws he does not like because the constitution gives him no power not to execute laws. To infer such latitude would invite an authoritarian rule anathema to our founding fathers' vision. President Obama admitted as much when he said, The fact of the matter is, there are laws on the books that I have to enforce. He was specifically talking about immigration laws.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In 1996, Congress passed a law which requires federal immigration agents to deport illegal immigrants, with few exceptions. The statutory language is mandatory. Thus, whatever prosecutorial discretion which may have existed previously, was specifically eliminated by that legislative act. Yet, the President is now, in effect, ordering those agents to break the law. He cannot, on his own, engage in a de facto repeal of this law by executive action. To do so would be, quite simply, lawlessness and a dereliction of his duty.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If President Obama can refuse to enforce a valid federal law affecting millions of people, are there any limits to his powers? After all, he has frequently threatened, Where Congress won't act, I will. What is to stop him from rewriting other laws with which he disagrees? Or to act where Congress has declined or refused to act? Can he abolish certain tax laws because Congress chooses to keep them? Can he banish all sources of energy except renewables to advance his agenda on climate change? If so, why even have a legislative branch of government? What's the point of a Constitution which enumerates and circumscribes powers and duties?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Men like Madison, Jefferson and Adams were keenly aware of the tyranny and corruption of authority concentrated in too few hands. They knew the thirst for power posed an existential danger to those who cherish freedom. Their genius was in crafting a sustaining document that would end the arrogance of one man rule and protect the inherent rights of all men. They knew that absolute power corrupts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And they feared future presidents like Mr. Obama.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In the history of our republic, no president has dared turn his high office into an instrument of unrestrained power. They held too much respect for their fellow citizens than to abuse or misuse the principles of our democracy. Even Lincoln's actions to preserve the nation during the Civil War were grounded in the Constitution and the rule of law.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But, like the title of his autobiography, Mr. Obama's measure of himself seems defined by the word audacity. It is no more evident than now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Can Uncle Sam tax, spend, borrow and print money to return America to prosperity? President-elect Joe Biden's American Rescue Plan, announced Thursday night, makes a $1.9 trillion bet that we can.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The Biden plan is almost a replay — except with more than twice the price tag — of the strategy that President Barack Obama and then-Vice President Biden employed in 2009 with their $900 billion stimulus bill. Even by Obama's own numbers, that bill led to hundreds of thousands of fewer jobs than if we had done nothing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So now here we go again with a second kick of the mule. Actually, it is the third, fourth or fifth kick. Trump and Congress have already approved nearly $3 trillion on pandemic spending. The Biden proposal would bring the total spending for the pandemic to about $5 trillion.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "All that Biden's proposal does is stimulate Washington and many of the governments in blue states in America, which have lockdown governors who have bankrupted their own states.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Casey Mulligan of the University of Chicago and I estimate that at least 4 million jobs would be destroyed by the Biden bill because all of the free money makes work less essential and — in many cases — less financially attractive than getting off the couch and working. That's some stimulus.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In addition to sending $1,400-per-person checks to millions of American households — helicopter money — the Biden plan includes $350 billion for a blue state bailout, paid parental leave, a $15-an-hour minimum wage, $400 a week bonus unemployment checks, transit aid, paid leave of $1,400 a week, some $100 billion for school aid (for schools that have been shut down for almost a year!), health equity grants, student debt relief and checks for illegal immigrants.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I wonder whether any of the politicians in Washington understand one of the first rules of finance: debts have to be repaid.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If income limits to receive the $1,400 per-person checks remain the same as for previous such payments, individuals who make up to $75,000 (and $150,000 for married couples) would be eligible, with payments phased out as income rises.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "All that is missing is the Green New Deal. Does any of this have anything to do with a health emergency?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If the idea here is to create jobs, there is a less expensive and much more effective way to get employers to hire and workers to get back in the labor market. We could completely eliminate for an entire year the 7.5% payroll taxes paid by every small business and taken out of every worker's paycheck. That would unleash millions of jobs. This would have virtually ZERO administrative and bureaucratic costs. Maybe that's why Washington pols don't want to do it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Instead, we now get Phase 7 of debt spending — and Biden wants another trillion-dollar infrastructure bill to follow.

{"original": "two. But this is the first time we have had a comprehensive agreement with", "augmented": []}
{"original": "China on technology issues, agricultural issues, financial services,", "augmented": []}
{"original": "purchases, and has a real enforcement mechanism. So this is a big win for", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: The last time we spoke about this, looking at this deal at the", "augmented": []}
{"original": "end of last year, we were expecting that there would be a snap-back", "augmented": []}
{"original": "provision in there where, if China doesn't keep its promises, if they lie,", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as they have for so many times to so many different parties, that the U.S.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "would be able to snap back tariffs and -- in place. Is that still in it, or has that been changed through translation?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "MNUCHIN: No, that is still in it, Maria. There is a real enforcement", "augmented": []}
{"original": "provision. And if they don't comply with the agreement, the president", "augmented": []}
{"original": "retains the authority to put on tariffs, both existing tariffs and", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: And what about the agricultural buying, because that is another", "augmented": []}
{"original": "question? There are concerns this morning, as you know, Secretary, that the language", "augmented": []}
{"original": "has been changed in translation. Why wasn't the English version released to", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the public, so that we can understand specifically what is in the deal", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we're away -- 48 hours from signing? People want to see the English", "augmented": []}
{"original": "version. Was it changed in translation?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "MNUCHIN: Maria, let me first say it wasn't changed in translation. I don't", "augmented": []}
{"original": "know where that rumor started. We have been going through a translation process that I think we said was", "augmented": []}
{"original": "really a technical issue. And the language will be released this week. So I", "augmented": []}
{"original": "think it is -- the day of the signing, we will be releasing the English", "augmented": []}
{"original": "version. And people can see. This is a very, very extensive agreement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: So, you expect the Chinese to buy $40 billion to $50 billion of", "augmented": []}
{"original": "agricultural products from the United States, then?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "MNUCHIN: I do. Let me just say, it is $200 billion of additional products across the board", "augmented": []}
{"original": "over the next two years, and, Specifically, in agriculture, $40 billion to $50 billion.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, this is a big opportunity for our farmers. And I think some people have", "augmented": []}
{"original": "questioned whether they can produce it. And the president said they are", "augmented": []}
{"original": "going to go out and buy more land and produce plenty of agriculture.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: On the intellectual property issues, you have been talking a", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Is it true the Chinese recently adopted malicious cybersecurity rules that", "augmented": []}
{"original": "negate any opportunity for the U.S. to protect its intellectual property?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "MNUCHIN: No, Maria, that is not true.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There are very important intellectual property rules in here that we expect", "augmented": []}
{"original": "them to adhere to. There are cyber concerns that we do have. So let me just", "augmented": []}
{"original": "be clear. Cyber will be part of phase two.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But we have incorporated provisions in phase one that we think are", "augmented": []}
{"original": "important protections for U.S. companies. So, we have made very clear there", "augmented": []}
{"original": "can be no forced technology transfer and that China is putting out laws to", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Senate. When would you expect that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "MNUCHIN: I know it is going through the Senate committees now. We expect", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it to pass quickly. We hope that this little sideshow that is going to show", "augmented": []}
{"original": "up at the Senate doesn't delay it. But we look forward to the Senate acting", "augmented": []}
{"original": "quickly. And let me just say, the president's economic program is really coming", "augmented": []}
{"original": "together. As we have talked about Maria, from day one, it's tax cuts, it's", "augmented": []}
{"original": "regulatory relief, and it is trade. And the president has delivered on all", "augmented": []}
{"original": "three. You saw the stock market break 29000 for the first time last week.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: That was pretty incredible, actually. Looking at the backdrop in the terms of the economic growth story, that is", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what driving the markets. I know that we got more signs of jobs growth on", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Friday, with the jobs numbers coming out,although it is slowing down from", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the numbers we saw about a year ago. What would be your expectation for growth, economic growth, and jobs in 2020?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "MNUCHIN: Well, Maria, I wouldn't focus on any one week. We have created", "augmented": []}
{"original": "more jobs under President Trump than ever created before.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That is something that we continue to focus on. And we look forward to a", "augmented": []}
{"original": "healthy economy in 2020. Now, let me just say there is no question that the", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Boeing -- the Boeing situation, it is going to slow down the GDP numbers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Boeing is one of the largest exporters.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "BARTIROMO: And the trade story is one leg of the three legs in terms of", "augmented": []}
{"original": "deregulation, tax legislation, and the trade changes that you are making", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the administration has led here. Would you expect things to pick up in 2021, then? What is your expectation", "augmented": []}
{"original": "MNUCHIN: Well, I think, for this year, we have been looking at 2.5 to 3", "augmented": []}
{"original": "percent, as I said. It may be closer to 2.5 because of the adjustment of", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the Boeing numbers. But this would have been 3 percent otherwise. And I think there is no", "augmented": []}
{"original": "question that USMCA and the China deal are going to add significantly to", "augmented": []}

{"original": "and they're going to be put on trial, because they don't have a case.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The other is that she wants him to have a State of the Union where there's", "augmented": []}
{"original": "some uncertainty. After it's all over, after he's been exonerated, then he", "augmented": []}
{"original": "goes before the world at the State of the Union and lays out the state of", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this union and the state of the world.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The world is going to be more peaceful and prosperous and less war, because", "augmented": []}

{"original": "possible that someone that only had secondhand information could possibly", "augmented": []}
{"original": "be a whistle-blower, when it wasn't on the form.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What we got back was essentially a non-answer answer at the early stages of", "augmented": []}

{"original": "And what I said at the time, even though the media largely ignored it, I", "augmented": []}
{"original": "said that we're not finished with the ICIG.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Lo and behold, the Democrats know that the ICIG is a major problem. You", "augmented": []}
{"original": "know why? Because they haven't released his testimony. So he's the only", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one. Of all the Star Chamber games that were played in the basement of the", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Capitol, with these secretive interviews, the only one that's not released", "augmented": []}
{"original": "is the one with the I.C. inspector general.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That is -- that's unacceptable. So what we're asking for here is -- because", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what he's claiming is essentially that we're just dumb, we made mistakes,", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it was a -- it was a huge mistake.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's fine, if you want to claim incompetence, but you need to have the", "augmented": []}
{"original": "documentation, the evidence to prove that you were indeed incompetent,", "augmented": []}
{"original": "because it just doesn't pass the smell test. And it looks so much like", "augmented": []}

{"original": "BARTIROMO: This is unbelievable. So do you think you will get these answers?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "NUNES: Well, I think it's pertinent that the ICIG get these answers by", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Friday, because this is the guy who lit the fuse for this impeachment scam", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that's now going to be on trial in the Senate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, if he wants to clear his name and prove that he is, in fact, and his", "augmented": []}
{"original": "office is, in fact, incompetent, he needs to provide the evidence that he's", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: Well, the whistle-blower apparently also worked for John", "augmented": []}

{"original": "this ICIG actually has connections, was a lawyer for some of the very", "augmented": []}
{"original": "people that were involved in the FISA abuse scam.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So all of this becomes intertwined and related. And we need to get to the", "augmented": []}

{"original": "provide evidence, which is really -- the I.G.s, that's their game, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's what Horowitz proved is, they're very good at getting e-mails and", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Well, that, in and of itself, was essentially a lie, or very close to a", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lie, because she knew from the House Republicans that there was a fraud on", "augmented": []}
{"original": "They had more information and evidence than we did. And so now you have a", "augmented": []}

{"original": "If rural, more conservative areas see a large surge in turnout on Election Day, then that will be a key for Loeffler and Perdue to win.

Rather, Soros argues that this economy is so good it can't last.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Now politically, Tedros was a member of the Tigray People's Liberation Front, that's a Marxist-Leninist Ethiopian political party. It is part of the coalition ruling Ethiopia as a repressive authoritarian state.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "After taking control of the World Health Organization, Tedros promptly tried to appoint Robert Mugabe, the murderous dictator of Zimbabwe as an international goodwill ambassador for public health, if you can believe that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Tedros delivered a speech praising Zimbabwe as, A country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the center of its policies to provide healthcare to all. Now, that's lunatic. But bad politics aside, Tedros has endangered human lives, which is a weird resume point for a man running a World Health Organization.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As Health Minister in Ethiopia, on three separate occasions, Tedros covered up cholera outbreaks in the south of the country. To downplay the outbreaks and to protect the Ethiopian's reputation, Tedros each time insisted that they were simply rashes of acute watery diarrhea.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "According to media reports, Ethiopian officials pressured aid agencies to cover up the truth about what was happening and hide the number of people affected.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As soon as the disease spread to neighboring countries, it was obvious that it was cholera and identified as such. If Tedros had told the truth at the time which he did not, lives could have been saved.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This is the man running the World Health Organization at the beginnings of a global epidemic.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "When coronavirus first broke out in China, China refused to admit international health experts into their country to assess it. To this day, it seems likely that China is lying about the number of infections and the number of deaths. Yet despite this, Tedros has publicly praised the Communist Chinese party for transparency.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "STIER: Well, that's right, even though U.S. taxpayers cover about almost half the bill for the WHO, a $2 billion a year WHO budget, we have very little say over what they do, and they have elections. Different countries have voted to support Mugabe. There's been a corruption at the WHO before Mugabe.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But people like myself who were sounding the alarm bells to have a Marxist -- this guy was the number three official in a Marxist regime of Ethiopia.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And as you pointed out, he went on to appoint Robert Mugabe of all people to be a goodwill ambassador. This says a culture of corruption at the WHO that goes beyond Tedros. It goes beyond the prior Director General. It's part of the culture.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This was not -- you pointed out the $200 million a year they spend on first class air travel and hotels, that's more than they spend on AIDS, tuberculosis, and other diseases combined, and there's no oversight.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "RICHARD GOOSTEIN, FORMER ADVISER TO BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON: Can I just say one thing?

{"original": "So I just wanted to again, commend you.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "GOODSTEIN: If the public doesn't have confidence in Donald Trump around these issues, there's a reason for it. So here's my answer on how South Carolina is going.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CARLSON: Science. I mean, I could ask you -- I actually -- I am interested in science and watching it be trampled. What do you think of the whole gender thing?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I mean, let's have this conversation later. Let me ask you, you're a more moderate Democrat. You're worried about Bernie Sanders. You are for Klobuchar or Michael Bennet, but you're probably now, Biden is one of your last hopes. How do you think Joe Biden is doing and what is he running for tonight, do you know?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GOODSTEIN: So I think, you know, you could show a lot of gaffes about Joe Biden. You could have done the same thing if you covered him decades ago. This is him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The good news for Joe Biden is he says is, don't compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. And he'd be running against somebody who thinks that Frederick Douglass has a great future, who thinks that an American invented the wheel, who cannot pronounce the word anonymous or origin.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So that's the virtue of where a Biden presidential candidacy will be relative to Donald Trump. Is he doing well? No.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CARLSON: So do you think he is capable -- but sincerely, do you think he is capable of governing the country, an honest question right now, Joe Biden.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GOODSTEIN: Yes, I think if you listen --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CARLSON: It doesn't seem like he is.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GOODSTEIN: Yes. I think that's a fair question. Look, he obviously knows what he is running for. When Donald Trump couldn't say Namibia, but he said Nambia, did I think he kind of knew that there was a Namibia? Yes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But I'm just saying, of course, I think if you listen to Joe Biden, over hundreds of hours during this campaign answer questions about all the issues that he had to deal with in the White House, yes, I absolutely think he is quite capable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CARLSON: So what's your plan for the Bernie ascendancy? Are you going to stay in the country?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CARLSON: Switzerland? Like, have you gamed this out yet?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GOODSTEIN: For the first time, Bernie is being vetted. Hillary gave him a pass. Huge mistake, I think in retrospect, and frankly, all the other Democrats so far have given him a pass.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Finally, he's an unreconstructed socialist. He's talked about nationalizing telecommunications and banks and everything, and he means it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Again, just like he said, good things about Castro. Trump has said good things about, you know, the head of North Korea and Turkey and you know, other authoritarians.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I am not quite prepared to throw in the towel.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CARLSON: It might happen. Washington is lobbying for Turkey. If that's disqualifying, you've got nowhere to have lunch with as you know.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GOODSTEIN: I am saying, I'm not prepared to believe that Bernie Sanders is going to be the Democratic nominee.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GOODSTEIN: I think people will throw a fit if he gets a plurality, but doesn't get the nomination. And I'd say go. Go whoever you're going to go with. We need somebody who is going to be a good Democrat, not what you are.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CARLSON: Okay. I will visit you as you're being re-educated. That's my pledge to you.", "augmented": []}

Apparently, Pete Buttigieg thinks no one is going to remember that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NATION HOST: Yes, it's a little insulting, isn't it? But more insulting might be when he changes -- the only unique thing about Pete at this point is his last name. But if he changes that to Obama, then he will have everything wrapped up perfectly.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Look, this is a guy -- I mean, what else can you do now? But it's not just that. It's tweets that were similar with that speech. He was tweeting the same out, but it's also the cadence. It's not even just plagiarizing the words. It was the rhythm of the delivery, and even some of the gestures, the way that he held his face.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This is a guy who wants to be President, who doesn't even have the confidence to be himself. This is a man where there's apparently has no confidence in his own ideas or his own rhetoric or his own ability to inspire people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You know, this is -- the only good thing here is, is that after Obama campaigned with platitudes like that, he actually got into the White House and failed. At this point, we can have the guy fail before he gets real power.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So we could have this do over and that's fine with me. It can also be like when you're dating someone and maybe, you're thinking about marrying them, and then you see on America's Most Wanted that he is really an escaped prisoner from a year ago and you find that out before you get married.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's one of the other benefits. It's sad perhaps for the Pete supporters, but this is what I think also is insulting. He has got about I think 10 percent now black support in South Carolina. It is that he may believe here, that if he copies an African-American who is well regarded by the black communities here in America, that he can somehow trick them into voting for him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I think that Americans, regardless of our skin color deserve a little bit more respect for that, a little bit more regard that everyone, regardless of our complexion, wants to hear real solutions about real issues on policy and this is where he is really dropping the ball to say the least.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CARLSON: Well, it is kind of the end of the road for identity politics. I mean, he is running on who he is rather than what he would do or what he believes in, but he's really going to have to for this to work, convince people that he is a biracial community organizer. I don't think he can pull that off.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BRUCE: Well, that's it. I don't think he can, too. He wants to run as being who he is as a gay man, but then he also wants to run as being someone else. And that's really breaking the barrier when it comes to identity politics, isn't it?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "She should not be worried about you or anyone else. She's got a job and she needs to stay in her lane. But everything that you said about her is accurate and right on point.", "augmented": []}

But no, she is mad at you. She is mad at the President. She wants to have a hearing on whether or not there was jury bias in private because she doesn't want anyone intimidating the jury.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Well, here's the bottom line, the juror foreperson herself outed herself. We know that she is an anti-Trump person. She has posted many things about Donald Trump, about Russia, about Roger Stone at least once and she is a partisan. She ran for Congress.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This is the kind of stuff that we seek to find out in a voir dire. This judge should be outraged not at anyone other than that juror. And the fact that she decided that she wouldn't recuse herself when she has already prejudged the issue by saying, this jury acted with integrity and intelligence. How do you know, judge? Have you spoken to that juror? Do you know what was posted? Do you know how she answered the question?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What do you know about her background? Did she want to get on that jury? And everything in my gut tells me she wanted to get on that jury and denied doing anything that was partisan. Shame on the judge.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "They're not talking about someone who has HIV, doesn't know about it and gives it to a sexual partner. They're talking about knowing your status and you're either choosing to lie about your status to the person you're engaging in sexual intercourse with, or just not telling them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Of course, the reason why you wouldn't tell someone is the fear that they're not going to give you any consent. So the state that talks about affirmative consent when it comes to HIV infection, all of a sudden they're saying, oh, you know, it's not that important.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The reason that they give behind this is what's most troubling to me. So they argue that by treating HIV as a negative by criminalizing HIV, that you're stigmatizing people who are living with HIV. That's a ludicrous argument.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We're stigmatizing people who choose to infect someone else with HIV. And they say, well, you know, Science and Medicine is so much different now that you can take a one a day pill, and you're basically going to be okay. So it's not that big of a deal to have HIV. That's their argument, which of course, there's certainly truth to the point of Medicine and how it's no longer the death sentence it once was.", "augmented": []}

You start with the personal protective equipment. This is the masks, and the gloves, the Tyvek suits, things like that that our public healthcare workers need. We're making sure that we can secure those supplies tomorrow. H.H.S. is going out with an RFP to secure a half a billion face masks alone.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Second thing is the treatment options. We've got three balls in the air on that. There's a drug called remdesivir which is administered intravenously, going through clinical trials.

We've already set out a plan to develop a vaccine in less than half the time it usually takes with the combination of private sector efficiencies, and regulatory streamline and then finally, and importantly, there's point of care, diagnostics.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The problem, Tucker that we have now is if somebody has symptoms, they have to go to a hospital, take a sample, send it to a lab and wait 48 hours for that. What we're trying to do is adapt existing handheld devices to the coronavirus so that workers out in the field can get instant results.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And Tucker, the President has been working on this from the day that he pulled down the planes from China on, I think, it was January 29th.

{"original": "CHAD WOLF, ACTING U.S. SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: Thank you for having.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: Tell me what the department is doing to protect Americans against this coronavirus right now, whether it be at the airports or anything else.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, the president's been very clear, and that is to protect Americans. So, what we have done is, we have put together a multilayered strategy, an across-agency task force to address this issue.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, we have put measures in place at airports of entry, at land ports of entry and at maritime ports of entry. So, in the air environment, we're funneling flights from China to 11 airports. And that also includes any other individuals coming from any other country that have been in China in the last 14 days, to make sure that they get the right medical screening and the medical care that they need at those 11 airports.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And so what we hear from the CDC and the medical professionals at CDC, that 14-day period, whether you're symptomatic or asymptomatic, is very critical.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, we're looking at that. We're making sure that, again, folks have the right medical care. And if they need to be government-quarantined or a self-imposed quarantine, that they are -- that they do that and, again, that they have the medical information they need to protect themselves and their -- and their loved ones.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: Yes, I think -- I think you make an important point here, because there are certain points of entry where you see more Chinese nationals coming in this country than others, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We have got that actually here on screen. Explain us -- walk through that for us.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The 11 airports that we are funneling flights to carry the vast majority of traffic from China. What we have seen over the past several weeks is, the three major U.S. carriers all but ceasing flights from China.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, the majority of flights that are coming in from China are Chinese airlines carrying mainly U.S. passengers -- or U.S. citizens, I should say. But, as we look at land ports of entry, when we look at the total amount of individuals crossing, we see the highest amount of Chinese nationals crossing in Blaine, Washington, San Ysidro -- and that's in California -- and Buffalo.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, we're taking extra precaution at those ports of entry, as well as all ports of entry, to make sure ,again, the medical care and screening is occurring there, and, again, if quarantine is necessary, that they have the procedures and the facilities to do that at those ports of entry.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I would also say that our U.S. Coast Guard...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WOLF: ... is heavily involved in our maritime ports of entry.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We're looking at those cargo ships that, again, are carrying crew perhaps from China, have been in China to make sure that -- again, that they are not carrying the virus, are not showing symptoms. And, if they are, they're not coming into the U.S.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We're holding them off -- out of the port...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WOLF: ... and taking necessary precautions that way as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: Secretary, let me switch gears, because we know that New York, Andrew Cuomo is suing the administration over the decision to ban residents from the trusted traveler program.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I want to ask you about what's going on in terms of this lawsuit and why the administration is doing away with people who have this Global Entry program. Tell us what the issue is.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WOLF: So, I would say we get sued all the time, and I'm happy to get sued for doing our job.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The specific issue here -- and I think there's a lot of miscommunication and misinformation out there. So, people will -- this has nothing to do with illegal aliens receiving driver's license. This has nothing to do with the sanctuary policies of New York.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Both of those are misguided, in my opinion.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WOLF: And they're dangerous. But it has nothing to do with what is occurring now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: Secretary, hold on one second.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: You know what? This -- I have to -- I have a follow-up on this, and we have got to really get into this subject.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: So, stay with us. We will take a break.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We are with Chad Wolf this morning. You will want to hear this next part of this interview.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: And I am back with acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Secretary, you know, on the China situation, it's amazing to me that they're criticizing the United States for limiting travel. Meanwhile, they have got everybody locked down in their homes in China.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I mean, so this coronavirus situation is serious. Thank you for addressing it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now please address the New York situation, New York and the administration.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WOLF: Yes, let me restate by saying that this has nothing to do with, again, the law that they passed regarding providing driver's license to illegal aliens.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Again, that's wrong. That's dangerous, and that's irresponsible. But that's separate from what we're -- what we did this week.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "New York is the only state -- and that bears repeating -- the only state that restricts CBP access to their DMV data across the board, not only for immigration purposes, but for law enforcement purposes, for customs purposes, but also for trade and travel facilitation purposes, the only state, which is precisely why we took the action that we did.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, if -- if New York, again, wants to restore this access, then we're happy to continue to process these applications. But, specifically, what they did is, they don't allow CBP to check their DMV database as they vet applicants for a Global Entry or another trusted traveler program.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, what does that mean? It means that CBP doesn't have access to indicate if an individual has a DUI, or has another aggravated traffic offense. Either one of those are disqualification for the program.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, my job is to make sure that that program maintains its integrity, so that individuals in New York are processed and evaluated the same as individuals in Michigan, Minnesota, or California.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And, right now, because New York took this action, the department had to respond and take appropriate action to make sure that the rest of the individuals in these programs continue to be able to use the program.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: So, very clearly -- very quickly, just to be clear, Secretary, the state of New York, Governor Cuomo will not allow Customs and Border Patrol to have access to the Department of Motor Vehicles Web site and the data in the DMV, Department of Motor Vehicles.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Why do you need that data, real quick?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, to vet an applicant for a trusted traveler program, we look at a number of different data fields and databases. And one is to determine whether or not they have certain misdemeanors.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you have a misdemeanor, you're disqualified from participating in this program. If you have a DUI, if you have another aggravated traffic offense, whether that's a misdemeanor or a felony, you are -- you are disqualified from this program.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Without access, we cannot run a proper security check and a risk assessment. And that is simply dangerous.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I would also say, from customs inspection...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WOLF: ... we have CBP officers at ports of entry every day. And they don't have access, law enforcement access, to do their job, which is also very dangerous.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "All right, Secretary, we will be watching this situation. Thank you very much, Secretary Chad Wolf, joining us there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: And now this from this past week.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Jobs and investment are pouring into 9,000 previously neglected neighborhoods, thanks to Opportunity Zones, a plan spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott, as part of our great Republican tax cuts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "TRUMP: In other words, wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that haven't seen investment in many decades, creating jobs, energy, and excitement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "TRUMP: This is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this. It is all working.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Senator, great to see you. Thanks very much for being here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SEN. TIM SCOTT (R-SC): Thank you, Maria. It's good to be on the number one Sunday morning show in America.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, sir.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: Congratulations to you with these Opportunity Zones.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Just to be clear, this was your idea. This was your bill. You took that bill to the president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: And he ran with it. Tell us about it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The president deserves so much credit for focusing on the most vulnerable Americans in this nation. And he's bringing $67 billion back into some of the most vulnerable communities in the country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I'm thankful that he supported my legislation, the Opportunity Zone bill, that is bringing that -- those dollars back.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But the good news is, in those areas, we have seen as high as an 8 percent wage increase. And, Maria, you know we're celebrating over 3 percent wage growth in America. Can you imagine areas with an 8 percent wage growth?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "These are blessed times for Americans who are looking for hope. The president has becoming -- has become a purveyor of hope.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We had the jobs numbers out on Friday. We're now at a record low.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: Two hundred and twenty-five thousand.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: Right? A record low in terms of unemployment for the black community.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We are at record lows for Hispanics, certainly...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: ... and obviously a very good number for the national rate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But with wages up 8 percent, how you say it, unemployment at a record low, what is this doing in terms...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: ... of the African-American community in America and their -- and their support of President Trump? Because there are a number of polls out there, and the number ranges.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Has it changed, the support for the president?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: Well, on Election Day 2016, he was around 8 or 9 percent. Right now, his approval rating on the last four polls that I have seen is over 30 percent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And there's a very specific reason -- reason why that is the case. He has not only said what he was going to do. He actually has done it. Whether it's permanent funding for HBCUs, historically black colleges and universities, or criminal justice reform, Opportunity Zones, heirs property, working on sickle cell anemia, this president has been delivering for three years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And it is now gaining traction in African-American communities across this nation. And that's really good news for this president. And, frankly, it's fantastic news for America, because we're proving that, no matter where you live, the American dream is alive, it is well, and it is healthy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I talk about a lot on Mornings With Maria on FOX Business that income inequality has narrowed. This is a huge issue right now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: And this has been an issue for years, but it's actually happening. It's narrowing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And yet your colleagues on the left don't see it. Take us behind the curtain during that impeachment trial that you were there last week. Then you saw the State of the Union, where Nancy Pelosi ripped up the president's speech.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: Well, there's one thing that is completely clear from the impeachment trial.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It was definitely not a fair trial. In a fair trial that began in the House, the president would have had the opportunity to have his attorneys cross-examine the witnesses that were coming out against him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In a fair trial, the president would have had an opportunity to present witnesses. In a fair trial, the president would have had an opportunity to participate in all 78 days of the trial.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But in the unfair trial in the House, he was forbidden, locked out for the first 71 of 78 days.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: He was not allowed to participate in the process.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There is nothing more sacred in this nation...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: ... than the presumption of innocence.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: And he was denied that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: And that's just -- it's heartbreaking.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: We have got to talk more about this. We have got to talk more about this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We will be right back with Tim Scott.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I am back with Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And, Senator, you were talking about the absence of due process as it relates to President Trump.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: You gave a speech on fairness the other day.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I want to talk to you about this, because, while there has been a double standard with President Trump, equally double standard is the fact that all of the wrongdoing that we know occurred in 2016, period, where they put informants, leakers, as well as wiretapping against the Trump campaign, your colleagues on the left will not acknowledge it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: Well, that's the most amazing part of the process.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you look at the very foundation of impeachment, it did not start three or four months ago. It actually started in January of 2017.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "One of the first headlines in The Washington Post was, impeachment begins. And what happened immediately? The Russia investigation. Can you imagine how much time, energy and money, $32 million, I think it was 2,800 subpoenas, 500 individuals called in...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: ... dozens of FBI agents digging into the president's past, into the political operations to find some link.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The entire foundation, the presumption of innocence has been void for this president the entire time he's been in office. It is the closest thing to a witch-hunt we have seen of a president in my lifetime.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: So, you were at the State of the Union.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And you saw when the speaker ripped up his script. And you saw when the president pointed out certain people, important people, who were sitting there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: And they didn't stand up.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: I was shocked on four different occasions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The first one, which I thought was amazing, was when the officer, the Army soldier walked in, and you saw his wife's face. She was shocked, the little girl and their son being reunited with their family.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: To not stand up for that, I don't understand.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The little girl in Philadelphia, 11 years old, cute little girl, with her smart glasses...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: She's getting a scholarship that was -- she was locked out of for over a couple of years, a third of her life. She's 11.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: You think about the 100-year-old Tuskegee Airman who's now a general officer because of President Trump. Not a single person stood.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A person who was a drug addict is now working for a company in an Opportunity Zone.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: He is receiving the type of praise and, most importantly, the second chance that is the American story, the story of redemption. And not a single member on the other side stood for that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And then the speaker of the House would tear up the speech that illuminated the accomplishments of this nation, the pioneering nation that we are, the nation that is the best place to get a second chance...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: ... just like I received as a kid?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I want us to think thoroughly through what it was that she was tearing and shredding. It wasn't the president speech. It was the reality that this nation continues to rise to the occasion. And we do it consistently.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: Yes. The vitriol is incredible.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I think, in your speech, you said, look, if we can't have due process for a sitting president of this great land, what does that mean for the rest of us?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The thing I always think about is, if you can't -- if you won't do it for the president, you won't do it for the one who's penniless.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: If you won't do for the prince, you will never do it for the pauper.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: In other words, if you won't do for him, I'm in trouble.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Every single American should be concerned when the president of the United States, in a nationally televised trial, is eliminated from the process for the first 71 of the 78 days.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: And then the House managers want witnesses.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Well, we had 190-plus clips of 13 witnesses that were -- appeared in the Senate trial.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: How they can stand and look the American people in the eyes and say, there were no witnesses in the Senate trial...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: ... when we had 13 witnesses.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And just to be clear, I know that there was a total of 18 witnesses in the House. But you only saw 17 transcripts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: We're still waiting on the 18th transcript of the I.G...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: ... which I don't know why that hasn't been released.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: You and I both know why it hasn't been released. I know why it hasn't been released, because it doesn't reinforce the negative fictional fact pattern, fictional fact pattern.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: This is kind of like Neverland.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It doesn't reinforce that, so you will never see that come out of the House. It's a shame, because it's a sham.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: Senator, it's great to have you this morning. Thank you so much for joining us. We so appreciate it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: Please come back soon, Senator Tim Scott there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT: Let me know when. BARTIROMO: And thank you for connecting the dots, because it did start with the Russia collusion narrative. And it all started with Devin Nunes exposing the truth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Take a look at this, President Trump calling out Congressman Devin Nunes. He's going to be joining me next.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Despite the impeachment saga ending in acquittal, House Democrats are still yet to release one of the transcripts from their closed-door politicians.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Joining me right now is Republican Congressman Devin Nunes of California. He is ranking member of the House Intel Committee.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And, Congressman, it's good to see you. Thanks very much for joining us.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA): Great to be with you this morning.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Congressman, let me ask you what happens now, because I know that the speaker has said she wants to continue investigating President Trump.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "NUNES: Yes, it's not going to end.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "They have been doing it since the president was first elected, just like Senator Scott just said. All the major newspapers in this country, the legacy media owned by the billionaires, they have all been calling for it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So this has been a work in progress. And they imploded with the Russia investigation in a big way, because it was a complete hoax. And then they manufactured this new Ukrainian hoax, which we're starting to get to the bottom of this hoax.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I think, as soon as the whistle-blower actually gets called -- or the supposable whistle-blower gets called before the Senate and conducts an interview, you will be able to fit the pieces in between the Democrats in the House and their staff, who met with the whistle-blower, and this scam that the ICIG is under, who refuses to provide the evidence for his outlandish claims that you didn't need to have firsthand information, you only had to have secondhand information, and that somehow, miraculously, the form was changed, and then none of those stories actually make any sense.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And when you put all that together, I think you're going to find a fake impeachment hoax.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "During prior years in the economic recovery, gains had largely been made by those at the higher end of the income scale.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Wage increases among low-wage workers have been attributed to a number of factors, including a strengthening U.S. labor market. With the unemployment rate hovering near multi-decade lows, businesses have to compete for qualified workers – which tends to result in increased pay, even for those in low-skilled and/or low-paying positions.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Conservatives have long believed individuals and businesses are better positioned to spend their own money and have fought the growth of government for many principled reasons.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "These reasons include: opposition to the higher taxes and borrowing required to pay for spending; lower growth rates and opportunity costs incurred by removing resources from the private sector; inefficiency and corruption created by empowering politicians, unelected bureaucrats, and special interests to pick winners and losers and allocate resources; and decreased personal freedom and increased dependency that accompany a more powerful government.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Trump modified the traditional conservative argument that the problem was government was doing too much for too many — and instead argued it was not doing enough for the right people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Trump expanded the definition of the deserving poor to include everyday working families whose wages had stagnated for years.

There has also been talk of proposing payroll tax cuts, Congressional sources tell FOX Business.", "augmented": []}

And that corruption we saw with regards to the conduct in Ukraine as well as the call to Secretary of State Raffensperger as well as the incitation to insurrection.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I mean, this is obviously very serious and an attack on the very foundation of our democracy and it is something that has to be considered and resolved.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: There is talk among some Senate Republicans about ending this trial on a procedural ground, whether it's even constitutional to try a president who's already left office. And not even get to the issue of President Trump's innocence or guilt.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "How would you feel about that, trying to end this trial on this constitutional issue?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ROMNEY: Well, the Democrats have the majority in the Senate and I doubt that they are going to go along with that move. At the same time, if you look at the preponderance of the opinion, legal opinion not by people who are partisan, but by scholars over the years about whether and impeachment trial can and should be held after someone has left office, the preponderance of opinion is that in fact yes, and impeachment trial is appropriate after someone leaves office and that's something I concur with.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But again, I will listen to the arguments that are made by counsel on both sides to make a final determination.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: In his inaugural address on Wednesday, President Biden made a call for unity. Here is some of that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban (ph) -- rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Now, some of your Republican colleagues, including Marco Rubio, who's going to be on in the next segment, say that President Biden has already breached that call for unity with some of his actions, executive actions, legislative agenda in the opening days.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Do you see an inherent conflict between calling for unity and a new president pursuing his agenda?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ROMNEY: Well, I think it would be unrealistic to assume that Democrats and Republicans are going to see eye to eye on every issue. There are going to be differences of opinion, that's expected. But at the same time, I think it's appropriate for us to have unity of purpose, unity of heart, a recognition that we respect each other and treat each other with comity and that is something which I believe President Biden wants to see.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "At the same time, I think there are some actions the president is taking that are going to lead to some anger and division. I think, for instance, saying we're not going to allow further leases on the government land for oil and gas, that obviously very badly hurt some of our rural communities, stopping the Keystone pipeline, that puts a lot of people out of work. Those people are going to be understandably angry.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So I think you've got to be pretty careful even recognizing the bounds of disagreement, to not do things that incite a great deal of unnecessary anger.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Let me ask you about another pressing issue, may be the most single pressing issue, and that's COVID. You have said that after the Congress passed a $900 billion COVID relief package just last month that you don't have much interest in passing another Biden rescue plan for $1.9 trillion, more than double what you just passed. Are there some parts of the Biden rescue plan that you could support?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ROMNEY: I think that's very possible. The last time around, a bipartisan coalition came together to look at the needs of the American people and came up with the $900 billion plus plan. We'll listen to representatives of the White House today to understand their perspective, but if there are places that we missed in our proposal, we are happy to pick that up.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The president wants to extend unemployment benefits if people are still unemployed, that is certainly something we would look at. We were of the view last time that states needed help, some rescue for states and localities that may have suffered a reduction in their revenues. That's appropriate, but the total figure is pretty shocking, if you will.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And the idea that we need a stimulus is a little hard to understand, because I'm one of those that's convinced that if you want to see this economy get going, we've got to get beyond COVID. If we get beyond COVID, I believe that the economy is going to come roaring back. And spending and borrowing trillions of dollars from the Chinese among others is not necessarily the best thing we can do to get our economy to be strong long- term.", "augmented": []}

So there will be some new faces.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): Thank you. Thanks, Chris.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: You have come out strongly against the idea of holding this impeachment trial. But now it is going to happen.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What do you think the rules should be about the length of the trial and whether or not to allow witnesses to be called?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "RUBIO: Well, first of all, I think the trial is stupid. I think it's counterproductive. We already have a flaming fire in this country and it's like taking a bunch of gasoline and pouring it on top of the fire.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Second, then I look back at the time, for example, Richard Nixon, who had clearly committed crimes and wrongdoing, and in hindsight I think we would all agree that President Ford's pardon was important for the country to be able to move forward and history held Richard Nixon quite accountable for - - for what he did as a result.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In terms of the rules, I think the president is entitled to due process. I think he's entitled to have a defense. I think he's entitled to present, you know, testimony and evidence if necessary and, you know, the House doesn't have much of a record of witnesses and so forth because they, frankly, rammed it through very quickly. So, I think, obviously, fairness is important no matter who it is we're talking about.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But I just want to repeat, I think this is going to be really bad for the country. It's going to take us -- not just is it going to keep us from focusing on really important things, but it's also just going to stir it up even more and make it even harder to get things done moving forward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Senate -- Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell spoke about Donald Trump's responsibility this week. I want to play part of what he said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): The mob was fed lies. They were provoked by the president and other powerful people. And they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Is Senator McConnell wrong, sir?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "RUBIO: I think the president bears responsibility for some of what happened. I -- it was most certainly a foreseeable consequence of everything that was going on. And -- and I think that's widely understood and maybe even better understood with the perspective of time. I think that's separate from the notion of, let's revisit this all and stir it up again.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It's not -- you know, I -- the stories are still going to be written. There's criminal justice investigations that are going to continue to move forward. All these things are still going to happen.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "All I'm arguing is, we have some really important things to work on. You want to really kind of bring the country together and remember once again how we can get things done, it isn't by uniformity on all the issues, it's about working through a process that allows people with different points of view to debate all that and get to a solution for the country. All that -- we're just going to go -- we're going to jump right back into what we've been going through for the last five years and stirring it up again with a trial. And it's just going to be bad for the country. It really is.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: So let me ask you the same question I just asked Senator Romney, would you support ending this trial if you can on procedural grounds, that it's unconstitutional to try a president whose left office without ever getting to the issue of the guilt or innocence of Donald Trump?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "RUBIO: Yes, the first chance I get to vote to end this trial, I'll do it because in think it's really bad for America. If you want to hold people accountable, there's other ways to do it, particularly for a president, including, as I said, the perspective of history and even now as people are learning more about all of this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But it's really bad -- when you talk about situations like this, this is not a criminal justice trial, this is a political process and ultimately it is a political process that's going to inject things into our public discourse, into a debates, that's going to make it harder to get important things done and it's just going to continue to fuel these divisions that have paralyzed the country and have turned us into a country of people that hate each other.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: I want to ask you one less question on this and then we'll move on.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What about the argument that it would be useful, from the point of view of -- of -- of people who think that what the president did was wrong, to ban him from seeking public office again, which would be one of the results of holding this trial?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "RUBIO: I think that's an arrogant statement for anyone to make. Voters get to decide that. We -- who are we to tell voters who they can vote for in the future?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I -- I talked with Senator Romney about Joe Biden's call for -- for unity. And you have spoken sharply already about Biden's first days in office. I want to put up a tweet that you -- you sent out on Friday.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So far Biden has talked like a centrist but governed from the radical left.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, Senator Rubio, is talk of unity from this White House dead already?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "RUBIO: Yes, no, unity and ideology are two separate things, OK? Unity is to mean uniformity. That's ridiculous. We are a country that the elections prove it, the 50/50 split in the Senate proves we've got people with very different opinions and we settled that argument through a process in our republic in which we elect people to have debates and try to find a way to move forward. That's separate from portraying yourself as a centrist.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But the first thing you do is get thousands of people fired at the stroke of a pen by ending the Keystone Pipeline, jump on the issue of -- of, you know, gender when it comes to sports and who can use what bathrooms and so forth and so on, an immigration order that I think could be read -- I've asked for clarification, I hope it doesn't mean this, but I think it could be read to say that someone whose committed a very serious crime, has raped or sexually abused a minor, as long as they were released from prison before the 19th of January, they're not a priority for deportation. Those are not centrist ideas.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, I understand Joe Biden comes from the left of center. I understand all that. But this is -- some of these are far left of center ideas. So my point in that tweet was, he may use the language, the rhetoric, even the demeanor of a centrist, but so far his policies don't seem to represent that. And -- and I think that's an important thing to note as we get into these debates about different issues.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: I want to pick up on this issue of immigration.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "President Biden assigned a number of executive actions on immigration in these first few days. He has introduced legislation that would give 11 million people a path to citizenship over the next eight years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You, of course, back in 2013, were a leader on the issue of immigration reform. You had a plan that would lead to a path to citizenship, as I remember, in 13 years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But you're talking about the Biden plan so far on immigration as -- as coming right up close to amnesty. Is that fair?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "RUBIO: Yes, because that's very different from what we talked about back then. That -- that -- back then we also talked about $25 billion, $30 billion for border security, including fencing and so forth. It talked -- it had those sorts of provisions in there. It talked about reforming the immigration system so that it was more merit-based, meaning you bring people in on the basis of what they can do for a living and not just primarily whether they have family members living here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's not what he's talking about. He's basically talking simply and almost entirely about what to do with people that are here in an unlawful status, of which I think the majority of Americans believe we need to do something. But you can only do something after you've gotten place immigration reforms that allow you to secure the border and stop illegal immigration, otherwise doing something is going to encourage more people to come.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We saw a very brief example of that. Just the fact that he was elected incentivized some of these trafficking networks to try to push people to the United States through one of these caravans. That's a reality.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And -- and -- so, again, I -- not -- not to mention that back when we did it in 2013 we weren't in the midst of a pandemic, which I think should be the number one focus outside of national security. And I actually think it's related to national security.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Is -- going to switch subjects on your now -- is the GOP still the party of Trump for the foreseeable future? And do you see it at some point over the next three, four years moving away from President Trump?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "RUBIO: The GOP is the party that nominated Donald Trump. And the reason why it did and ultimately got him elected and he got 75 million votes is because you have tens of millions of Americans that feel this economy isn't working for people like them, that feel socially displaced, even like strangers in their own country, and who believe that both of the parties, at least traditionally, and all of politics doesn't understand or care about any of this, that they don't matter to people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Donald Trump did not create those things. He -- he got elected because of those things. He got 75 million votes because of those things. And those factors, those feelings that are out there among tens of millions of Americans didn't leave when he left on Wednesday. They're still there. That's why he got elected and that's what I hope we'll be a party of.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, I hope we can do it in a way that keeps the people who believe we're fighting for them and brings back some of the people that perhaps didn't vote for Republicans or didn't vote for the president because they may not like, you know, the way it was said or the way it was done. I think that's quite possible. And I think that's the future of the Republican Party because, frankly, on that I think depends the future of the country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Finally, you're up for re-election in 2022 and there has been talk, as I'm sure you know, about the possibility that Ivanka Trump might run against you in a Republican primary in Florida in 2022.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "How seriously do you take Ivanka Trump as a potential opponent?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "RUBIO: Well, I -- I -- I don't really get into the parlor games of Washington, other than to tell you that when you decide to run for re- election in a state like Florida, you have to be prepared for its competitive race. You run it like a competitive race. So that's what I'm preparing to run, a very competitive race against the tough opponent.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "So that's what I'm getting ready for. I'm getting -- if you're going to run from Florida Senate, if you're going to run statewide in the state of Florida, you're going to have a tough race. And that might include a primary. That's their right under our system.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: President Biden has taken office confronted by a public health and economic crisis. And in his first days he signed a series of executive orders to ramp up COVID vaccinations, expand testing, and reopen schools. Joining us now, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Doctor, I want to start with the president's call this week. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're in a national emergency. We need to act like we're in a national emergency. So we've got to move with everything we've got. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: Mr. Biden promises 100 million doses in the first 100 days. And you have said that the administration is sticking with that promise.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But, Doctor, there are experts who say, at that pace, 100 million doses in 100 days, we will not contain the virus here in the United States until 2022, until sometime next year. Don't you have to go faster than that? DR. ROCHELLE WALENSKY, CDC DIRECTOR: Good morning, Chris.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Yes, we have to go faster. We are limited by numerous constraints here. The first is the supply, and we're working closely with the manufacturers so that that does not become a constraint. We also need to sort of make sure that this -- the supply gets to pharmacies, that we have enough vaccinators, that we have enough places and outreach to do the vaccinations. So, yes, I think that the supply is probably going to be the most limiting constraint early on and we're really hoping that after that first 100 days we'll have much more production, not just for these two vaccines, but we are hopeful that we'll have another one from Johnson & Johnson in the weeks ahead and perhaps even a fourth coming down the pipeline. So -- so we are really hoping that we'll have more vaccines and that will increase the pace at which we can do the vaccinations. WALLACE: I want to get to those supply concerns in a moment. But let's talk about the stakes first. We are already seeing variants of -- of the virus from the U.K., from Brazil, from South Africa that we're being told are more readily transmissible, are deadlier and more resistant to the virus. Aren't we in a race against time to -- to vaccinate everybody before we get a variant that actually blocks the vaccine, makes it impossible for the vaccine to -- to actually protect people? WALENSKY: You're absolutely right.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And we are now scaling up both our surveillance of these and our study of these in cross-agency collaborations with the NIH, with the Department of Defense, with the FDA, with the CDC so that we can monitor these variants, as well as monitor how the impact of these variants on vaccines, as well as on our therapeutics. And you're absolutely right, what this tells us is that we need to get more vaccine out there and that people really, when they have -- are offered the vaccine, have the opportunity to roll up their sleeves and take it. WALLACE: But -- but is that fair to call it a race against time? To -- to make sure that -- that you vaccinate people before we get a strain that the vaccine won't work on? WALENSKY: I would say we've been in a race all along. The more virus that is out there, the more virus that is replicating, the more likely that we are going to have mutations and variants. So not only do we need to vaccinate, but we need for people to wear masks, we need all of these other mitigation strategies so that we can decrease the amount of virus that is circulating and, therefore, decrease the amount of variants that are out there. WALLACE: I want to talk about this supply side issue.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Yesterday, Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York state, said that state has already run out of its initial run of doses. Are we going to get into a situation by let's say the end of March, where the initial run, 200 million doses from Pfizer and Moderna are -- are gone, you don't have enough from Johnson and Johnson or other people, and we're really in a supply crunch by the end of March? WALENSKY: You know, from the data that I've seen so far, my understanding is that the current supply crunch is the one that is -- I'm most worried about. We have every indication that over time we'll get more and more vaccine. So we certainly can't predict any of the -- the obstacles that would come in our way here. But from the data that I've seen so far, I'm hopeful that we'll actually get an increasing amount of supply, not a stagnating one. WALLACE: And -- and is there a specific point in this whole run that you're particularly worried about in -- in the next two or three months that you think the first doses will have run out and we won't have geared up for a second run? WALENSKY: You know, we are carefully monitoring the second doses that are going to be required in the time ahead so that people who have gotten their first dose will have access to their second dose.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So I'm -- I'm really hopeful that that is not going to be the case. But what you're commenting on is absolutely true, that we don't have as many doses as we would like now for states like New York, for other states that are see -- claiming to have run out of vaccine. And so right now is actually the pressure point that I'm feeling and by the end of March or so I really do hope that our production has scaled up dramatically and that we actually have way more supply than we do right now. WALLACE: Then there is distribution. The new White House COVID coordinator says what you inherited from the -- the Trump administration is much worse than any of you could have imagined. What is the distribution problem and how do you fix it? WALENSKY: You know, I would say one of the biggest problems right now is, I can't tell you how much vaccine we have. And if I can't tell it to you, then I can't tell it to the governors and I can't tell it to the state health officials. If they don't know how much vaccine they're getting, not just this week but next week and the week after, they can't plan. They can't figure out how many sites to roll out, they can't figure out how many vaccinators that they need and they can't figure out how many appointments to make for the public.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So if they overshoot it, then we have vaccine on the shelf. If they undershoot it, we have these queues and queues of people, people whose appointments are canceled. And, either way, we have challenges. So the fact that we don't know today, five days into this administration, and weeks into planning, how much vaccine we have just gives you a sense of the challenges we've been left with. WALLACE: One sign of the crunch that you're facing, at least in the short term, is that CDC put out guidelines this weekend that under, quote, exceptional circumstances you say that it would be OK to -- to mix doses, to use one vaccine for the first dose and the other vaccine, Moderna and Pfizer, for the second dose. And you also said, under these exceptional circumstances, instead of the three to four weeks that are recommended, that -- that patients could take the two doses as far as six weeks, the first dose from the second dose. But -- but, Dr. Walensky, you don't have any trials, clinical trials, you don't have any science to back that up. WALENSKY: I want to be very crystal clear here, those are not the recommendations of the CDC. The CDC recommends that you follow the FDA authorization, 21 days for Pfizer, 28 days for Moderna, and you stick to the same one. But the CDC is a place that people come to for guidance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And we know that not everyone is going to receive that second dose at 28 -- 21 days, 28 days, and some people likely will have forgotten which dose they got, which vaccine they got, and they will come to us and they will say, what do we do now? And that is the purpose of that guidance, it is to say, in those exceptional situations where we couldn't follow the CDC guidance, what do we do now? That was the purpose of that statement. WALLACE: Finally, I got about a minute left here, Doctor.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The CDC has traditionally been and --and -- and, you know, over the years I've talked to people in your position during various -- the swine flu, Ebola -- the head of the CDC has been the great authority, the lead agency in things like this pandemic. But you write this week, in The New York Times, and I want to put it up on the screen. You say that you will have to work very hard to restore public trust in the CDC, which, quote, has been undermined over the last year. How much damage, Doctor, did the Trump administration do to the standing of the CDC? And how do you fix that? WALENSKY: You know, I would say that the people of the CDC has been -- have been muzzled. The science has not always been followed. The great news for me and for the agency is that those exceptional public health servants, those exceptional scientists are still there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What my job is to make sure is that their voice is heard, that their science is heard, and we, again, become the trusted authority for public health around the world.

{"original": "GERALD SEIB, EXECUTIVE WASHINGTON EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, you know, three things strike me, Chris.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The first is, this has started big. You know, 30 executive orders in two and a half days, I mean that's not -- that's not sleepy Joe Biden. And you're going to see more of the same this week, by the way, more executive orders, more on coronavirus, maybe more in immigration. So this is an attempt to have a very fast start.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The second thing is, I think we have learned, if there was any doubt, the coronavirus overshadows everything. I mean there's an awful lot being banked on this $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief and stimulus package that the president's putting forward. And a big event today when Brian Deese, the head of the National Economic Council, starts to talk with senators about that, you heard Senator Romney refer to that a few minutes ago.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And then, third, I think the great question is whether the -- the center and political unity that Joe Biden has talked about an awful lot can really hold. That's an open question and I thought it was interesting how aggressive Senator Rubio has been and was on this show about questioning whether the center is really holding.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Jason, do you think the president will get anywhere with Senate Republicans on the $1.9 trillion COVID rescue package? And if they block that, what do you think are the chances that either on that legislation or something else that Senate Democrats will eventually decide, you know what, we're going to kill the filibuster and run the Senate on a one-vote majority?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "JASON RILEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think the package will pass in -- in some form and I think parts of it should pass, particularly the parts dealing with COVID and -- and -- and vaccination programs and funding those sorts of things, more testing and so forth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "My problem with the package has to do with some of the things I think will be harmful, actually. I mean take the $15 federal minimum wage proposal, Chris. You know, restaurants have been one of the hardest hit industries over the past year and they rely on a lot of low skill workers. And a $15 minimum wage will make it more difficult for them to find workers because these low skill workers will be priced out of -- out of the labor force. So I don't think something like that is helpful. Or extending unemployment benefits -- or supplementing unemployment benefits that discourage people from returning -- returning to work because they're being paid more to stay home. So -- so some of this I don't think deserves to pass, but some of it should and some of it I think will.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I don't think killing the filibuster would be a very smart idea for Democrats. They -- they would seem to be making the mistake of thinking they'll be in control of the Senate indefinitely. And, of course, that is not the case. And you have some senators, Mark Kelly out in Arizona, Raphael Warnock in Georgia, that are going to be up in two years. And -- and so I -- you know, this -- this is still a very, obviously, closely divided Senate and I don't think they want to -- they want to jump off that bridge.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Donna, your -- your thoughts about the prospects for the COVID rescue plan, because while Jason said he thinks some of it will pass, he was talking about a lot that he thinks Senate Republicans won't go for.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What do you think of the prospects for that and eventually, because you know that the Senate Republicans are going to block some legislation, some of the stuff that -- that Joe Biden is talking about as a national emergency, at a certain point do you think Senate Democrats are just going to not be able to restrain themselves and try to kill the filibuster?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "DONNA BRAZILE, FORMER DNC CHAIR AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first of all, I -- I agree with Jason, I think there is so much good in this $1.9 trillion package that the -- the country is -- is really anxious for. The fact that we are still behind on testing, we're behind on disturbing the vaccines. I mean if you look across the country today, before 8:00 in the morning, many states rollout there openings and then by 9:00 there's no way you can get a vaccine. So I think this -- this package will go a long way in healing some of the pain that we're feeling, the -- the people who are still struggling. And there are many businesses that did not get anything in the last two rounds. So this is a -- I think, a credible package.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Joe Biden was elected to -- to help lead us out of this pandemic. And he's going to continue to fight for that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I also believe that the Senate do not wish, at least Senate Democrats do not wish to see the same replay as they witnessed back in 2009 where basically one person can block the -- all of the good ideas that come forward. So Democrats will have to continue to keep their option on the table to eliminate the filibuster. The -- the framers never intended for us to -- to have super majorities in order to get things done.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BRAZILE: And I think it's -- they need to look at it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: And then there is the second impeachment trial, the second impeachment trial, of Donald Trump.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "WALLACE: Gerry, we heard two very different opinions from Romney and Rubio about whether this trial is just something you have to do, or whether it's going to be terribly destructive to the country and -- and, frankly, destructive to Joe Biden's first days and his agenda in Congress.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Where do -- where do you come down on that, and is there any chance that 17 Senate Republicans will join with Democrats to convict Donald Trump?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SEIB: You know, what -- what I'm really struck by is the fact that the president, Joe Biden, has never expressed much enthusiasm for this impeachment trial. They're not opposed to it, but I think they realize the potential for this to be a huge distraction and something that slows down the stuff we were talking about just a minute ago, the coronavirus package.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And also, by the way, something we haven't mentioned, nominations and confirmation of Biden cabinet picks. You know, those are going to be slowed down by this impeachment trial as well. That doesn't make anybody in the new administration particularly happy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So I think there's a -- kind of a decided lack of enthusiasm, but it's going to go -- it's going to happen. It's going to move forward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "One of the side effects here I think that's ironic is it's going to have the effect of giving Donald Trump something he craves, which is more attention and more oxygen. That doesn't please a lot of Republicans either.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: And what do you think the chances --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SEIB: Yes, I think the chances are very slim. I -- I just can imagine 17 Republicans moving. I think you're going to have some, but you're not -- I -- I would be stunned if you had 17.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Jason, what do you see this trial doing to the start of the Biden presidency?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "RILEY: Well, I think I agree with -- with Gerry. It seems like the Democrats want to get this done quickly and get on with their -- with their agenda. I think the Republicans -- you know, I'll be keeping my eye on -- on -- on Mitch McConnell. I think he's made some noises about conviction and I -- you know, so I'm keeping an eye on him. I think if he is in favor of it, you will see others follow.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I think Donald Trump is quite fortunate that the impeachment vote was anonymous and secret because, you know, several congressmen have said if it hadn't been there would have -- you know, there would have been far more than ten Republicans voting for -- for -- for impeachment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But the Republican Party has to decide whether, you know, they want to make a clean break from -- from Donald Trump and -- and -- and make sure he can't run for president as a Republican again or start a third party and run at the top of the ticket. And -- and that's part of what's on the table here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Thirty seconds, Donna, do think there's any chance that the Senate votes to convict Donald Trump?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BRAZILE: I think it's hard to get 17 Republicans. But, on the other hand, Mitch McConnell, when he took to the floor on January 19th, I was surprised by his comments.

{"original": "According to the single article of impeachment -- look at this -- Donald Trump is accused of inciting an insurrection because of his rally on January the 6th.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Quote: President Trump addressed a crowd at the Washington Monument, and by the way, there, he reiterated false claims. He also willfully made statements that in context encouraged and foreseeably resulted in lawless action at the Capitol.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, according to multiple reports, the breach of the capital -- this is from The Washington Post and fake news CNN -- was pre-planned well before the president's speech.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, we go to The Washington Post, they reported, quote, self-styled militia members planned on storming the U.S. Capitol days in advance of the January 6th attack. And according to The Washington Post, court documents and new arrests show, quote, the riot was not an entirely impulsive outburst of violence but an event that was instigated or exploited by organized groups.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CNN issued a similar report. Title of the article: Investigators pursuing signs U.S. Capitol riot was planned.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So the obvious question now becomes, well, how did -- if you read the article of impeachment, how did the president's remarks at the rally on January 6th incite the insurrection if the breach was all pre-planned?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And keep in mind, during his speech, the president, he did say the following: many of you will now peacefully and patriotically go to the Capitol to make your voices heard. A far cry from Chuck Schumer's own rant on the steps of the Supreme Court. Remember, he threatened Justice Kavanaugh, Justice Gorsuch, you will pay the price, he said. He screamed actually.

{"original": "As Senator Daines said, well, he put it this way -- Joe Biden is now putting Saudi Arabia first. And to add insult to injury, a new tax on gas very well may be headed your way and filling up your car is about to come a lot more expensive. The cost of heating your home is about to get a lot worse, and it's all worth it, according to Joe.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "She was able to confirm part of Biden's radical agenda, which raises the question -- well, when he was hiding in his basement, maybe the news mob and maybe those people in big tech, maybe they should have made a big deal because apparently, Joe is on board with D.C. becoming the 51st state.

{"original": "Now, Joe Biden now supports -- to recap -- a presidential impeachment, divisive, no unity there. And, of course, the smear campaign that goes along with it as he only listens to the fringe socialist leftist policies he's hearing every day, adding D.C. as a state, ending the filibuster, using executive orders, bypassing Congress and other branch of government, enacting a radical pro-illegal immigration and amnesty policy, and his anti-energy green new deal agenda that will ultimately cost you trillions of dollars.

{"original": "HANNITY: Immigration, amnesty, Paris accords, impeachment -- you know, this is a pretty radical change for the country. And every step of the way, what I see is losing jobs, costing billions if not trillions over time and a waste of money. And yet somehow, I guess America wasn't fully informed and now, D.C. statehood on top of it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PAUL: Well, here's the real question about impeachment. If they're going to impeach people who incite violence, I have a question, are they going to impeach Bernie Sanders? You remember the guy who shot Steve Scalise? Steve Scalise almost died. I was there at the ball field when he was shot.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The guy was a rabid Bernie Sanders supporter. And you remember what Democrats were saying at the time? They were saying Republicans health care plan is you get sick and then you die.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That sounds like an incitement. If you're telling people that the Republican Party is going to kill you, why wouldn't you then react violently and say we must kill them before they kill us?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, I don't propose, I'm not serious about this. I don't think Bernie Sanders should be impeached.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But if you follow the logic that the president saying go fight for your country is somehow to be taken literally, even though he used the words peacefully, you'd have to examine Bernie Sanders' language because one of his rabid supporters almost killed Steve Scalise.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What about Cory Booker? Booker said, get up in their face, get up in their face. Is that to be taken literally or figuratively, Cory?", "augmented": []}

Constitutionally -- I don't think it's constitutional, Senator. Then, of course, the argument will be --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HANNITY: -- if that -- if that's your standard, we'll use it against you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PAUL: And here's the thing, Sean. The story is now that chief justice will not appear, the chief justice doesn't appear to say that the Constitution says, he should appear for impeachment of the president. If the chief justice isn't coming, I think it's an illegitimate procedure and it isn't a real impeachment. It's going to be a fake partisan impeachment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But the story is, that the chief justice is not going to be asked. But the reason he's not going to be asked is he's privately said he's not supposed to come unless it's an impeachment of the president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, this is an illegitimate procedure and even the chief justice of the Supreme Court who's not a rabid Trump person, who's actually if anything sort of in the middle, he is now saying this is illegitimate because I'm not getting in the middle of this, and I'm not coming over for this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, that should tell people a lot of things, the chief justice of the Supreme Court is not coming over because it's not an impeachment of the president which is what the Constitution says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HANNITY: I agree with your statements, huge mistake, destroy the Republican Party. If Republican leadership goes along with this, they would destroy the party. There would be primary challenges in 2022 for everybody that went along with this, and you know, I just don't think it will happen. It certainly shouldn't happen.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You know Mitch McConnell better than anyone, he has -- he's the leader in the Senate. Apparently, had a call and every indication was he thinks it's unconstitutional or am I reading into that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PAUL: You know, I can't characterize the private call, but all I can say is Kentucky, 63 percent of us voted for the president. We listened to the speech, we've watched it, and we don't think politicians can be responsible when crazy people do crazy things.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The thing is, is, I think people need to write letters to Senator McConnell and call his office and let him know how you feel.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "People in Washington do listen and this is something that is under- appreciated. If you email Senator McConnell and you call him, 30 GOP county chairs have sent a letter to him saying they don't think we should be for impeachment. I don't know how he will come down on this, but I know that this is a partisan thing and even the chief justice the Supreme Court doesn't think it's legitimate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, yes, we need to make sure this doesn't happen because this is a terrible precedent and if we do this, if we say, oh, the president's speech incited violence, we need to examine then Bernie Sanders speech and Cory Booker's speech and Maxine Water's speech.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PAUL: That's not a road -- that's not a road we should go down, but if you use the logic they're using against Trump, they would have to look in the mirror and look at all the times they've said, go fight, win, get up in their face, throw their food on the floor, assault them in restaurants, yell and scream at them, all the stuff that happened to my wife and I.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You know, if they're going to -- if they're going to say Trump incited that, they need to look at all of their speeches, and I think what you'd find is no, they only want to look at Trump. They don't want to look in the mirror.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HANNITY: And the reason you don't have a snap impeachment because even The Washington Post and fake news CNN are reporting, oh, all indications are, even court filings are now showing this was pre-planned by a bunch of people that organized, and we better get a 9/11 style commission on this because this can't happen in our country, Senator. That's something all good people agree on.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "HANNITY: All right. In a week, we got open borders, amnesty, non- enforcement. We got the Paris climate accords. We're now going to just -- with the -- with the stroke of a pen, eliminate how many tens of thousands of jobs in many different ways. With open borders, we're going to have the few people, a few jobs available, would drive down wages for Americans in the -- in the short term and long term.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Well, I guess that's Biden's first week. Your thoughts?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "COTTON: Yeah, Sean, Joe Biden's first week, he's been very disappointing. You know, he stopped construction of the border wall. He even ended the remaining Mexico policy where migrants trying to approach our southern border for bogus asylum claims were staying in Mexico. and the Mexican government was cooperating with us.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, we're going to be releasing them into the country once again, to show up perhaps at a hearing months or years from now. He might as well just hang up a big open for crossing sign at our southern border. You see 7,000, 9,000 people in the caravan now, just wait until it's 70,000 or 90,000 because of Joe Biden's open border policies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "At a time when we're facing a global pandemic and we can't confirm if these migrants have or have not had the coronavirus, and when tens of millions of Americans are still looking for work or trying to get hours back, we're going to bring in more foreign workers to undercut their wages and take their jobs away from them. That is putting American workers last.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HANNITY: It looks like a super spreader caravan, because I saw a lot of people very -- there's no social distancing, very close together and they weren't wearing masks. And I don't know that they're going to have rapid results for everybody that illegally crosses the border in terms of coronavirus. One reason, we don't get to check their -- whether or not they have radical associations.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "More importantly, then you add the lost jobs with energy than the Paris climate accords. How bad is that going to be for the economy at this time, especially?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "COTTON: Yeah, it's really bad, Sean. And I can't think of another president who took office and consciously decided to eliminate American jobs. I mean, the Keystone pipeline alone generates more than 10,000 thousand high-paying blue-collar jobs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And then when you add on to that all the obligations and commitments the Obama administration made the Paris climate accord, you're talking about jobs in the oil patch, in the coal mines, in fracking and building pipelines and transporting that and processing it into electricity -- tens of thousands of jobs that Joe Biden eliminated with the stroke of a pen, merely because it's fashionable in his party to oppose any energy source that comes from fossil fuels.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HANNITY: OK, what do you make of this report in the Politico that it appears the chief justice wants to avoid this job of this impeachment because of how things, you know, played out? The snap impeachment in the House, I don't think the Senate should be validating that. I'm sure you don't either.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Also, what Rand was just talking, we have a lot of inciteful rhetoric of Democrats. I would assume that that would be brought up at any trial, as would the constitutionality.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And you have said you'd -- like me, I -- it's unconstitutional. Pretty clear cut to me.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "ABBOTT: You know, it's amazing because Biden has talked about taking down this wall despite the fact that for one that would pose serious challenges with regard to the open border issue that we're fighting back against. But, secondly, it would burden taxpayers with increased tax dollars being spent to do something that is a valuable tool in our ongoing fight against immigration that is illegal.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "General Motors announced this week that it repaid its multibillion-dollar taxpayer-backed TARP loans. GM even bragged that it was able to repay the taxpayers in full, with interest, ahead of schedule, because more customers are buying [GM] vehicles. There was great fanfare, including expensive, around-the-clock GM TV commercials nationwide. But, the hype is not the reality. In fact, GM did not repay the loans with money it earned from selling cars. Instead, GM repaid the TARP loans with money it withdrew from another TARP fund at the Treasury Department.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The day before the GM story broke, Neil Barofsky, the government TARP watchdog, testified before the Senate Finance Committee. He explained that GM did not use earnings to repay its TARP debt. The April quarterly report to Congress from his office stated: The source of funds for these quarterly [debt] payments will be other TARP funds currently held in an escrow account.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GM filings with the SEC reveal that GM was paying 7 percent interest on a $6.7 billion TARP debt. The filings also confirm that the source of funds for GM's debt repayments was a multibillion-dollar TARP-funded escrow account at Treasury; that means it was taxpayer money — not earnings.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Meanwhile, in all the fanfare and patting themselves on the back, Treasury and GM made no mention of what happened to the $2.5 billion loan GM owes its union health care plan. The union loan carries a 9 percent interest rate and runs until 2017. Don't most Americans try to pay off their higher-interest debts first? Well, the union loan was not paid off. Why not? Does the union get to keep collecting 9 percent from GM until 2017, courtesy of the American taxpayer, while taxpayers give up a 7 percent return over the next five years in exchange for the hope that GM stock will be worth more than what we paid for it, someday down the road?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It is far from clear how GM and the Obama administration could honestly say, much less trumpet in prime time television ads, that GM repaid its TARP loans in any meaningful way. The reality is that GM got additional TARP billions from a Treasury escrow account filled with taxpayer dollars. Taxpayers have not been paid back in full and are still on the hook for the TARP stock investment in GM. Whether taxpayer funds are ultimately recovered depends upon the administration's ability to sell GM stock at a profit some day. Of course, we all hope it works out that way, and it might. But, the American people deserve more than puffed-up press releases and misleading commercials claiming that GM paid its loans back to the government with money it earned. I recognize that one of the goals of the GM ad campaign is to build trust, but GM did it all wrong, apparently with some help from the administration. Shifting bailout money from GM debt to GM stock is not the same as repaying it. Stock is riskier than debt. Maybe it's a good idea. Maybe it's a step in the right direction, maybe not. Only time will tell. But, we should be clear with the American people about what happened here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The Wall Street Journal reports that Treasury is beginning to admit the truth. Treasury claims the source of the funds was clearly disclosed all along. Well, that might be technically true. However, to understand the disclosure you have to be a sophisticated investor with time to pore over the fine print buried in massive SEC filings and government reports prepared by independent watchdogs with teams of auditors. The average citizen, on the other hand, just sees the GM CEO saying that GM has paid back the taxpayer in full. The truth is that GM originally received over $49 billion from the US government and many billions remain to be recouped. That is why we were told at the Senate Finance Committee hearing that TARP losses related to the auto companies are expected to exceed $30 billion.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The timing of this maneuver also is troubling. The administration's so-called Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee, a TARP excise tax intended to recover TARP losses, was the subject of the Finance Committee hearing. The Office of Management and Budget, and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, estimate that overall taxpayer TARP losses will exceed $100 billion, and the auto companies will account for over 30 percent of that amount, more than $30 billion. So why does the president exclude the auto companies from his TARP excise tax proposal? I raised this issue at the hearing. I noted that GM refused to testify. The next day we learned that GM, with the permission of Treasury, withdrew billions from the TARP escrow fund and accelerated the repayment of the entire GM TARP loan. Immediately, GM and the administration launched a public relations campaign touting repayment.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "With President-elect Joe Biden's choice of Judge Merrick Garland as his new attorney general this week, the question arises: Will Garland carry out his responsibilities in a nonpartisan manner, or will he return the Justice Department to the days of the Obama-Biden administration — when, as I have argued, Eric Holder politicized the department more than almost any other prior attorney general?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Given some of Biden's choices for Garland's subordinates, Garland may have a difficult time avoiding the renewed politicization of the Justice Department.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Like recently resigned Attorney General William Barr, Garland has had a distinguished career. He is a former Justice Department lawyer and experienced federal prosecutor. He reached the highest point in his prosecutorial career when he was the principal associate deputy attorney general under Attorney General Janet Reno during President Bill Clinton's administration.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BIDEN NOMINATES JUDGE MERRICK GARLAND AS ATTORNEY GENERAL, NAMES OTHER KEY DOJ PICKS", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Garland is probably best known to the general public for his nomination by President Obama in March 2016 to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The Senate's Republican majority refused to hold a confirmation hearing for Garland, arguing that the nomination in an election year should be left open for the next president to fill. Democrats strongly objected to this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Before his Supreme Court nomination, Garland was recognized for his role in the investigation and prosecution of the 1995 bombings of the Oklahoma City federal building that killed 168 people. In 1997, President Clinton nominated him to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, where he has served with distinction ever since, including as the chief judge of that court.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The key question is whether Garland will carry out his role in an objective, apolitical manner. The fact that he's a well-respected federal judge and a former federal prosecutor gives hope that he understands the fundamental importance of his duty to not be the president's wingman — as Eric Holder once referred to himself — but to act as the chief law enforcement officer of the United States, who enforces the law fairly, regardless of the political consequences.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Our nation deserves an attorney general who makes prosecution decisions in the best interests of justice, not based on the political demands of the president or his allies in Congress.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Among the most sensitive issues the new attorney general will face will be whether to prosecute Biden's son Hunter for possible improper conduct involving his lucrative foreign business dealings, primarily with China.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Hunter Biden is now under investigation by the Justice Department to determine if he violated any tax and money laundering laws. Hunter Biden said in a statement last month that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately including with the benefit of professional tax advisors.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "President-elect Biden has expressed confidence in his son and said he will leave decisions on prosecuting crimes to the Justice Department. But it's certainly not hard to imagine the pressures any attorney general would be under involving an investigation of a president's son or daughter", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The attorney general must also demonstrate a willingness to go after prosecutors and others inside the Justice Department when they abuse their authority. Former Attorney General Barr did just that when he appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham to investigate the origins of what Barr summarized as frenzied and baseless accusations of collusion between the 2016 Trump election campaign and Russia.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Barr acted similarly when he launched the probe of the Justice Department's handling of the investigation and prosecution of Michael Flynn, who briefly served as President Trump's national security adviser. Barr initiated both of these internal probes even though they could end up embarrassing the Justice Department and result in the prosecution of federal agents and Justice Department lawyers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So a key test of Garland, if he is confirmed, is whether he will allow Durham to continue the Russia investigation or whether he will give in to political demands from Democrats to terminate the investigation. The premature ending of the probe would be a bad sign that politics is once again a prime consideration in the administration of the Justice Department.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Unfortunately, Garland may have a hard time maintaining a steady course if Vanita Gupta and Kristen Clarke are confirmed and given a free hand as the associate attorney general — the third- highest-ranking official in the Justice Department — and the assistant attorney general in charge of the Civil Rights Division, respectively.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Gupta and Clarke have a history of endorsing some radical ideas. Based on their past statements and actions, they think that voter ID requirements are an echo of Jim Crow, oppose equal enforcement of civil rights laws, and see the world through a racial lens.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Gupta is a former American Civil Liberties Union and NAACP lawyer who is currently the head of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. She headed the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department in an acting capacity during the Obama administration from 2014 to 2017, arguably in violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Rather than enforcing federal anti-discrimination laws on a race-neutral, non-political basis, Gupta acted as if the Civil Rights Division was simply the in-house counsel of the Democratic National Committee and its political ally, the NAACP. She used the division to attack voter ID laws and opposes other election reforms, such as maintaining accurate voter rolls intended to improve the integrity and security of the election process.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "During her tenure, the division's own website shows Gupta didn't file a single case against any of the numerous colleges and universities that are blatantly discriminating on the basis of race in their student admissions in explicit violation of federal civil rights laws.

I mean, there are real consequences to a prolonged shutdown. The president doesn't seem to understand that but it's really impacting small business. It's impacting people's lives.", "augmented": []}

It is, again, a waste of money and opportunity cost to protect the American people. But it is a diversionary tactic on the part of the president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: I want to ask you a specific question, Congressman, why is a wall immoral? I'm not asking why it's ineffective or why you think the money could be spent better, but the speaker keeps saying the wall is immoral. There's a wall or a fence around the White House. People build walls around their homes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Why is a border wall immoral?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CICILLINE: I think what the speaker is saying is that we believe in securing our borders. We have appropriated $1.7 billion over the last two years for border security. The department has spent less than 6 percent. But we are prepared to do more because we need to do more, but we want to do it in a way that's effective.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: If I may just press, why is a wall immoral?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CICILLINE: Well, that's a question the speaker will have to answer, but I think what she means by that is it doesn't reflect our values as a country, that America has been a place that welcomes refugees and immigrants, people who are fleeing violence and war.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But I think the real point of that, the rest of her sentence is it's not cost-effective. It doesn't achieve the objective. Democrats are committing to securing our borders. We have voted to secure our borders and appropriate significant resources to do it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CICILLINE: But let's use technology, let's use drones, let's use satellites, let's do cargo inspections, which aren't happening. Let's do things that will actually secure the border.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: OK. But let's talk about the effectiveness of it. Brandon Judd is the president of the National Border Patrol Council. He's been a border patrol agent for 21 years. Here's what he says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BRANDON JUDD, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL PRESIDENT: Anywhere that you look where we have built walls, they have worked. They have been an absolute necessity for border patrol agents in securing the border.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Here's a guy who has been on the front lines, on the border for two decades. He says border walls work.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CICILLINE: Well, look, I think there's no question there are places we have walls and fencing and other kind of barriers. I think good border security is going to be a combination of things.

{"original": "WALLACE: No, no, he's given up on the concrete wall. He is talking about steel fencing out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CICILLINE: But I think the reality is this is actually a fight the president has created to distract from the real issues that he's facing. The fact is the Republicans were in control of the House, the Senate and the White House for two years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And if this is such an important priority for the president, why didn't he do it at the beginning of the administration? He waited to the lame duck. Why? Because his defense secretary left with a strong rebuke of his foreign policy, his national security advisors sentencing hearing blowup because of the seriousness of the charges. His foundation was closed on for persistent illegalities. The gentleman heading the ISIS effort resigned.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CICILLINE: It was a bad couple of weeks. So what does the president do? He shuts the government down and he's distracted all the attention away from all of those pressing issues to the government shutdown.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: But, sir, the fact is, even The Washington Post today said that there is now a crisis at the border. There has been a dramatic spike in the number of family units coming across the southern border.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I want to put up some statistics. In November of 2017, a year plus ago, the border patrol apprehended 7,000 family units at our southwest border. This past November, two months ago, they caught 25,000 family units coming across.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And look at these recent incidents were border patrol agents had to fire tear gas at migrants who were trying to climb the fence and who were throwing rocks at the border agents.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I mean, Congressman, the president is not making this up.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CICILLINE: No, the reality is this is a complicated problem. It requires a sophisticated answer and I think the incoming chief of staff for the president and the outgoing chief of staff have both set up border wall doesn't solve this problem.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We need to have comprehensive immigration reform. We need to have additional personnel. We need to use technology. So we want to secure our border and respond to these challenges but we want to do it in a way that works, a way that will achieve the objective.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And so, what we are saying to the president is open up the government. These other departments have nothing to do with this. Do not punish the American people by shutting down government if you don't get your way.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: All right. I got --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Let me just interrupt because I have two minutes left and I want to get to questions in.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: The president said on Friday that he has the right, and he's even considering, and you heard it from Sarah Sanders just a moment ago, declaring a national emergency and building a wall in his own without congressional approval using funds that have been appropriated for military construction. If he goes ahead and does that, what will House Democrats like yourself do?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CICILLINE: Well, I don't think the president has that authority. He would have to meet a very high standard. Article One establishes the Congress of the United States and gives us the responsibility of appropriating money.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So I don't think the president has the authority to do that, and I hope you will continue to try to work with Congress to resolve this disagreement but open the government first. This -- the government will reopen when the Republicans in the Senate and the president come to their senses and recognize that we shouldn't be shutting down the government if they don't get their way.", "augmented": []}

At the same time, our caucus is big and diverse and people are bringing their passions and reflecting the strong feelings of their constituents, and there are a number of people who think we should move quickly on impeachment. I'm one of the people who think we have to wait for Mr. Mueller to complete his report so we know all the facts before we take any action.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: And really quick, yes or no, do you condemn that language?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CICILLINE: Look -- I'm not going to -- look, it's kind of odd to hear people on the Republican side who have not condemned the president's language in a million of different contexts to suddenly be clutching their pearls over her use of that language. Like, look, this is a private event, she can use whatever language she thinks is appropriate. The fundamental issues Democrats are fighting for the people of this country and we're going to focus on the issues that matter in their lives, and we're going to do our oversight responsibilities in a serious way.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "JASON CHAFFETZ, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I wish I could have that magic ball to tell you exactly what it is, and I hope it's sooner rather than later. But I think the Democrats have really put themselves in a tough box because the president is on the side of national security, protecting our border and doing what the federal employees, the Border Patrol, wants to do. They had 60,000 people they apprehended in November coming across the border. And when the Border Patrol goes out and says, we have to have some sort of impediment, something that will slow them down, some sort of wall or barrier, where we've done it in the past it work, that's a compelling argument.", "augmented": []}

If the -- if Nancy Pelosi were to say tomorrow, all right, we're going to give you the money for the wall, she'd be thrown out as speaker. Her -- her House Democratic caucus would not stand for that.

{"original": "WALLACE: President Trump responding to a brand-new Senator Mitt Romney, who wrote a controversial article this week saying the president has not risen to the mantle of the office, which understandably got a lot of attention.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And we're back now with the panel.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Congressman Chaffetz, you were -- are a former congressman from Utah. What do you make of -- of Mitt Romney, before he is even sworn in, having an op- ed in The Washington Post that -- that basically says this president is living -- not living up to his responsibilities as president, certainly in the image department, and what's the reaction been back home?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CHAFFETZ: Well, this is not the -- candidate Romney didn't -- didn't talk like this. That's not who he was. He accepted his endorsement in October. In a debate he was asked a question and he said he's putting the past behind him. He looks to working forward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I think it was an unforced error. And he was elected to represent the state of Utah to solve problems. This didn't solve a problem, it created a problem. I think it was an unforced error.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Why do you think he did it?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CHAFFETZ: I think he does believe it. I think it's in his heart. But -- and I don't think that it's going to do anything to actually move the meter and accomplish things. I don't -- I don't know why he would do it before he was sworn in. I think a lot of people are scratching their head.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: All right. We asked you for questions for the panel and we got a lot of head scratching and reactions on Romney's criticism of President Trump. Mike Johnson sent this on FaceBook. When is he switching to the Democratic Party, because he obviously is no longer a Republican? And Jean Caragher tweeted this, is he positioning himself to challenge President Trump for the 2020 nomination?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Marie, how do you answer them?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HARF: Well, in response to the first question, I think that's actually a problem the Republican Party has, that they -- that there are some member of the party, President Trump's base, that feels like there's not room in the public discourse for Republicans to criticize President Trump. And if that's the direction the party's going, they will, at some point, no longer be a true national party and they will be the party of the 30 percent Donald Trump base. So I think what will be interesting is what this Senate does as we get the Mueller report, as things get more difficult for the president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I don't think Mitt Romney's going to challenge Donald Trump in 2020. That's just my instinct. I do think John Kasich might. I think Jeff Flake might. And a lot will depend on the Mueller report. This is the 800-pound gorilla in the room and once we get that, I think you'll see some Republicans make some decisions about that primary.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Then there was, and we talked about this before with Congressman Cicilline, Congresswoman -- freshman Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and her attack this week on the president, her obscene attack, and President Trump's response.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "REP. RASHIDA TLAIB, D-MICH.: We're going to go in there and we're going to impeach the mother (EXPLETIVE DELETED).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "TRUMP: I think she dishonored herself and I think she dishonored her family.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Jonah, this clearly, in the very first week that the House Democrats took over and had done a lot of very careful things in terms of messaging, stepped on their message, the fact that we're talking about it, the fact that cable news has feasted on this. And I think, one, what do you think of that, and, two, the fact that this really indicate how much trouble Nancy Pelosi is going to have controlling some of the firebrands in her party?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GOLDBERG: No, I think that's right. I think there are two issues here. One, the expletive, which she should have apologized for and just moved on. I don't think President Trump has an enormous amount of credibility condemning that kind of language or debasing discourse in any way.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But then there's the actual -- the policy issue, which is the impeachment issue. And Nancy Pelosi's challenge is to do something that she didn't do very well the last time she was speaker, which is to try to move legislation that divides Republicans, that peels off Republicans. And the one thing that will keep Republicans unified, at least for now, prior to the Mueller report, is all this impeachment stuff. If it just becomes -- if the Democratic Party is the antimatter universe version of what you were talking but with the Republican Party, which I think is a real concern, of just the anti-Trump party, than that will unify the Republicans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And so get -- staying quiet about impeachment is totally in Nancy Pelosi's and the Democrat's long-term interest until there's a reason to actually talk about impeachment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: I mean, in fairness, we heard Congressman Cicilline today say exactly that, and Jerry Nadler, who is the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, which is where this issue of impeachment, if it's going to come up, would come up, said the same thing this week.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GOLDBERG: But it's a problem. But that's not with the rank and file want, right? In the same way that the Rank and file of the Republican Party wants it to be an always Trump all Trump party, the rank and file of the Democratic Party wants it to be an always anti-Trump party here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Well, let me ask Mo about that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "One, what do you make of Tlaib's statement, plus her refusal afterwards to apologize? And how much of a fever is there in the House Democratic Caucus to move right now and impeach Donald Trump?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ELLEITHEE: So, on the comment, I'd -- I'd -- I'd be hard-pressed to disagree with anything Jonah said. The -- I spent a lot of time talking and worrying about the trumpification of politics rite large and that people go to -- that he has now given everyone license to use this kind of language and I think that is wrong and I don't think Democrats can effectively argue against him by acting like him, nor can he criticize Democrats for acting like him. So I wish he wouldn't have used that language.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But I do think the bigger issue here is the talk of impeachment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ELLEITHEE: And I do think it is premature. I think most members of House Democratic leadership agree with that. Most members of House Democratic leadership understand that the politicization of impeachment, the way Tom Steyer is doing it, the way some members are doing it, is a very dangerous path to go down. There may come a time when this is a very relevant conversation and Bob Mueller will let everyone know when that time is.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But, until then, Democrats have a policy agenda to push. They've got a presidential policy agenda to stand up to. And they have an election to win. If they want to beat Donald Trump, the best way to do that, and have a mandate behind their own agenda, is to beat him at the ballot box. They've shown they can do that in 2018 and now they've got to do it in 2020. That should be where the energy of people like this remains focused.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: We've got about a minute left, Marie.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There was a very interesting moment on Friday because President Trump came out to the Rose Garden after his meeting with Nancy Pelosi and said, she assured me there's no interest in impeaching me, and she immediately pushed back and said -- or his staff did and said, she never said that, she just said this meeting is about reopening the government, it isn't about impeachment, which to me indicated that she and her people are very sensitive about the fact of not appearing to tamp down or step on -- not that they're pushing it, but they don't want to -- they don't want to stamp -- tamp down on Democrats who want to impeach.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HARF: I think that's right, but they always condition it -- always, always -- in the leadership of the Democratic caucus right now on the Mueller report. That we cannot do this for political reasons, like it appeared with Bill Clinton or like Tom Steyer is doing. So I think they will keep it on the table conditioned on Mueller.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: All right. Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Up next, our Power Players of the Week. We're going to introduce you to two new members of Congress and ask how they plan to reach across the aisle and end the shutdown.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: With the old guard in Washington not getting much done, we met this week with two new members of the 116 Congress to get their fresh ideas. We sat down with Democrat Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, who served three tours in Iraq with the CIA, and with Republican Mark Green of Tennessee, who was on the special ops team that captured Saddam Hussein. And they are our Power Players of the Week.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "REP. MARK GREEN, R-TENN.: We're delighted to be here. Thanks, Chris.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "REP. ELISSA SLOTKIN, D-MICH.: Thanks for having us.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: You both talk about trying to get things done, trying to compromise, to break the gridlock in Washington. Be specific.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Let me start with you, Congresswoman Slotkin. How?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SLOTKIN: Sure. Well, the perfect example is the government shutdown right now. We have the basis of a deal, right? Both sides are saying they care about border security. They believe in national security. Start having a real negotiation about border security, border forces, more technology at the border, fencing if we needed it in some areas. It doesn't just have to be a wall. That's the essence of a negotiation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So I think we can start now if people really care about getting something done.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: You're talking about the issues, I guess I'm talking more about attitude. Because it's -- you know, there are problems there and people have known about possible deals, possible solutions for a long time, but it never gets done. Why not?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GREEN: I think what we, as a class, the freshman class, brings, particularly the congresswoman and I, is, you know, a life of service to the country. You know, she's prior military, I'm prior military and we want solutions. And we're just sick and tired of it not happening. And our constituents sent us here to get it done. So we're -- we're rolling up our sleeves and going to -- going to get it done.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Well, I want to pick up on that because Congressman Green was a special operations flight surgeon in Iraq, part of the capture of Saddam Hussein. You served for years in the CIA, then for Presidents Bush 43 and Obama, a Republican and Democrat. What's the one thing that you think you can take from your service in national security and maybe help you here in Washington?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SLOTKIN: I mean, for me, it's mission, right? You have a mission. And when you're serving in the CIA or military, you wake up every day, you know what you're doing and why you're doing it. And I think it's no different in Congress. Some people have treated it as if they don't have a mission, that they're there for themselves, they're show horses, whatever. I think making sure that people remember that they were elected to get something done and passed legislation is the most important thing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: There are a lot of very well-intentioned people in that building behind me and somehow it doesn't get done.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Let's take the shutdown. The wall that the president says has to be a wall or, you know, some version of a wall. You hear Nancy Pelosi say a wall is immoral. How do you compromise from that kind of rhetoric?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GREEN: I think we find, you know, some common ground with what is border security and we get it done. I mean that's really what we have to do. And, you know, the president has looked at this and has said, this is what we need to do and, you know, I'm supporting him in this -- in this effort.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SLOTKIN: I just think it -- literally, life is about negotiations. There is no one who lives their lives just saying I'm going to unilaterally decide what happen. So, negotiate. Get in the room, kick out the cameras and get something done.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Where are you both on Donald Trump?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Question for you, Congresswoman Slotkin, are the Democrats, particularly in the House, too anti-Trump?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SLOTKIN: I think the tenor and tone that the president has set is just unbecoming of the country that I love. And, for me, that's critically important. I don't like policy by Twitter, but, to me, just because you're providing a check and balance on the president doesn't mean you don't have a responsibility to legislate and get something affirmative done. If we're only anti-Trump, we are not doing our job.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: On the other hand, congressman, you said during the campaign you can't imagine an issue where you would differ with Donald Trump.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GREEN: So far every action he's taken has been spectacular, from cutting taxes that created massive growth at least in our state in Tennessee, to one of the biggest pay raises for our veterans -- our soldiers in -- in ten plus years. You know, I -- I think the actions that he's taken are spectacular and I can't see an area where I would disagree with him at this point.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GREEN: I think maybe in some cases there are better ways to say things. But, again, I 100 percent support the actions that have been taken.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Over the next two years, and I'll start with you congresswoman, how confident are you that you're going to be able to change Washington instead of Washington changing you?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SLOTKIN: I think the nice thing is, we have over 100 new members in a body of 435 people. Any organization with that many new people, the culture changes. So I'm not saying it's going to be easy, and I've seen it already, you know, that sucking sound of people trying to get you to be very political, you know, salute the party instead of the country. You've got to be strong enough to push back. And that happens when you have people that you can link arms with and say, no, we're not going to do it that way, and I think we have that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GREEN: I came from a dirt road in a small rural town. My friends are not going to let me go off the rails. Many years in the military. You know, the night stalkers that I went to combat with are going to be on the phone with me saying, Mark, what -- what are you thinking if I -- if I do make the wrong decision or go the wrong way.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan would fight like cats and dogs in the daytime and in the evening they'd go out as Irishmen and have a scotch. And we've got to get back to doing that. And that's how we become friends. Maybe not agreeing, but -- but those relationships I think are what's really missing right now and something that I want to be a part of fixing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Congresswoman Slotkin, do you like scotch?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SLOTKIN: You know, I'm going to suggest Michigan beer. You might want to try it. But --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: All right. We'll leave it there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You see, can't even agree on that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Congresswoman, congressman, thank you both.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Good luck. We'll have you back and see how it goes.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "And earlier today, yes, yours truly, I made a surprise visit to what was a tiny -- I mean, itsy-bitsy, sparsely attended Biden campaign event. It's kind of a depressing site to be very blunt, and many in the audience who (ph) buses -- they were bused in, and a lot of people there, when I talk to them, they weren't even supporting quid pro quo Joe. They're kind of there for the entertainment.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "HANNITY: Joe Biden is on tape saying, you're not getting $1 billion unless you fire a prosecutor who's investigating his son. He has no experience in oil, gas, energy or Ukraine, and yet he's getting paid millions of millions of dollars.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "HANNITY: You're not answering my question.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HANNITY: Yes, I'm sure all of your sons and daughters are going to get millions of dollars just to get paid for doing and knowing nothing with no experience. That happens to all of us, right? I guess if we hit the lottery.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, we'll have the full tape coming up. It's very entertaining.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But first, we are only 267 days until the election. You will be the ultimate jury. You have an opportunity to shock the world once again, and this is political crunch time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The Democratic Party, we can report tonight, is an utter state of complete shambles. It is a mess. The Iowa caucus, a total unmitigated disaster. The field of 2020 Democrats so weak, so radical, so extreme, many party insiders are now actually freaking out on the outside.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Seventy-seven-year-old quid pro quo Joe, he's supposed to be the fresh new face of the Democratic Party. Look at the three older, let's see, Bloomberg, Biden, and Bernie Sanders, that's like 500 years old combined. He's supposed to be their front runner, but after a pathetic fourth-place finish in Iowa, his campaign is flailing and the polls here in New Hampshire not looking good either.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Over the weekend, a very agitated and frankly, well, again, incoherent Joe, snapping at a 21-year-old woman attending one of his town halls. It's not the first time he's been snapping at people that he's asking to vote for him. She dared to ask a question about the Iowa caucus and electability.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He said -- you can't make this up -- that the young woman had a dog face, and called the woman, 21-year-old woman, a liar. Great job, Joe.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So how do you explain the performance in Iowa, and why should the voters believe that you can win the national election?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's a good question. Number one, Iowa is a Democratic caucus. Have you ever been to a caucus? No, you haven't.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You're a lying dog-faced pony soldier. You said you are, but -- now, you've got to be honest. I'm going to be honest with you. It was a little bit confusing in Iowa.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HANNITY: First of all, he says, I am an Iowa caucus. What? It's just like Joe 30330.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And then he says to a 21-year-old woman, you are lying dog-faced pony soldier -- supposed to be the Democratic front runner. He's really connecting with the folks, with the people. We, the people, the people that he wants to vote for him. That's their top candidate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "This is now the third time that quid pro quo Joe was caught on camera being rude, nasty to voters. He said that he was only joking. It didn't look like a joke to me. But the 21-year-old college student at the receiving end of this rage -- well, she's not laughing tonight.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In fact, she is insulted that they are pretending this was some big, funny joke. She said quid pro quo Joe humiliated her and, quote, he has been performing extremely poorly in the race and the fact he couldn't answer a straight question without bullying or intimidating just exacerbates that fact.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "She's right. And earlier, tonight, our own Griff Jenkins was able to interview this 21-year-old student. Let's take a look.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Frankly, when he speaks, a lot of what he is saying is tasteless (ph) and very sad. And we have heard a lot about death and cancer and people losing their job. And to me, he doesn't really seem very solution-oriented in how to fix those problems. I don't think he has the momentum to carry this to a national election.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HANNITY: All right, not exactly the look for someone who at this point probably needs every vote he can get.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, of course, the campaign has more cause for concern then Biden's deranged rantings that are frankly unhinged. There are dozens of legitimate questions about zero experience hunter and his shady business dealings, not only in Ukraine but China and other countries. And then quid pro quo Joe Ukrainian shakedown -- remember, you are not getting the billion dollars, $1 billion unless you fire that prosecutor investigating my zero experienced son. Wow.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But quid pro quo Joe doesn't have any answers to that question. Every time he's asked, all we get is indignant rage, and, of course, the media mob never pushes him. Take a look.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And Lindsey Graham told CBS News, the Justice Department is betting information from Rudy Giuliani about your sons work in Ukraine. Are you concerned federal investigations may be on?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "HANNITY: I mean, the same Rudy Giuliani who nearly died on 9/11, became America's mayor and was there to really lead a country, that Giuliani? The guy that went up against the mob and became one of the toughest prosecutors in history? The guy that turned New York City, which was a dump into going from what, 3,000 murders a year or thereabouts to 300?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That same Rudy Giuliani, yes. OK, he's controversial but that doesn't answer the question, Joe, how does your zero experience son, no experience in Ukraine, energy, oil or gas, get millions of dollars? And how is it that you used leverage, I've even argue shook down the country of Ukraine and said you're not getting $1 billion unless you fire him. You got six hours, son of a B, they fired him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Really? Would you act that way if that was Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr.? Anyway, Joe 30333 is in a freefall and it's getting pretty nasty and negative and even turning on his Democratic opponents, including this brand-new ad against poor Mayor Pete Buttigieg who didn't exactly have the best track record in Indiana. Take a look.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "AD ANNOUNCER: And both Biden and Buttigieg had made hard decisions. Despite pressure from the NRA, Joe Biden passed assault weapons ban through Congress. And then he passed Violence Against Women Act.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "We're electing a president. What you've done matters.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HANNITY: And after days of vote counting, well, Mayor Pete apparently was the big winner out of Iowa, if anyone believes those numbers. And as the Biden ad points out, he struggles with minorities. He didn't look too good at over the weekend in that debate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, he fired South Bend's very first African-American police chief, he forced out the African-American fire chief as well. And during the last pathetically boring, unwatchable Democratic debate, not only watched it so you didn't have to and this wonderful audience of hours, he couldn't answer a question about why he oversaw a massive spike and minority drug arrests during his time as mayor of South Bend.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And Mayor Pete might be seeing a surge in the polls but he's not exactly popular with even his own constituents. He's now battling for first place in New Hampshire in the primary with congenital liar Elizabeth Warren and crazy Bernie Sanders, pretty angry socialist.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Sean, yes, Senator Sander's campaign is continuing to go after the youth vote with another free concert this time on a college campus and featuring the Strokes. This arena holds 7,500 people and it is mostly full.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Sanders campaign seems energized in tonight's huge showing and his comfortable lead over Democratic rivals in the final two New Hampshire tracking polls before voting begins.

{"original": "Now, fun fact, Mayor Pete just scored this year's largest Democratic rally in New Hampshire. He attracted a grand total of 1,800 people. All right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Let's compare that to the president's rally in Manchester, basically another pivotal night of the Trump show all across the country. Thousands and thousands and thousands of supporters started lining up overnight in the rain and the snow -- and I'm here in New Hampshire, I can report to you, freezing weather, just to get a spot inside this massive arena.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "All right. Joining us now at the big board at the very latest from a great state of New Hampshire, a host of Bill Hemmer Reports. Huge ratings -- Bill Hemmer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BILL HEMMER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hey, Sean, welcome to Bedford, right? It's beautiful, huh, here in New Hampshire.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HEMMER: Let me show you what happened four years ago, Sean. This is a primary one-on-one Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. This was all Bernie Sanders, 22 points, the largest margin of victory in 100 years here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, where do you find the votes in New Hampshire tomorrow? This it Maine to the east, Vermont to the west, Massachusetts down to the south -- half of the primary voters will come from these two counties right across the border from Massachusetts, Rockingham, where Sanders was a big winner over Hillary Clinton.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And our location here just to the west in Hillsborough County. So, we'll watch this tomorrow night as they come in, right around this time, a little bit after 8:00.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The other thing to look at here, the Connecticut River Valley here, a lot of liberal votes are find in places like Grafton County, that's where Dartmouth University is located. Bernie Sanders ran up the numbers in these rural counties, somewhat rural counties, you could argue, from four years ago.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Something that is kind of -- well, I will be watching tomorrow night, Sean. You go back to Iowa, there's an interesting development that may or may not be significant tomorrow night. Buttigieg in orange, Sanders purple, Elizabeth Warren in yellow. And I'll be out here to Johnson County, eastern part the state, here's the University of Iowa.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In this, a lot of young voters, a lot of progressive voters, they'd be attracted to the message of Sanders, or Warren, and like I mentioned on the western half of Vermont, they split the vote, 30 percent to 32.3 percent. Could that happen here in New Hampshire? It could, Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders from Vermont.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, that might be a dynamic to develop here tomorrow, so we'll keep an eye on that. Now, where do we stand as of tonight? Nine-thirty in the evening, here in New Hampshire, we put the polls together that went up to the 9th of February yesterday, the state of the race is -- perhaps all of the polls together, Bernie Sanders at 29 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 21 percent. You see Klobuchar, Warren and Biden, on down the line here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Twenty-four hours away, we'll know a lot more as this map comes alive, Sean. But until then, that's what we got, a pretty close race here in New Hampshire as it stands right now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HANNITY: All right. Bill Hemmer, thank you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And one of those 2020 Democrats looking to pick up some momentum is Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And, by the way, on Saturday, she made the bold move of defending the president's removal of Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, his twin brother, and Ambassador Sondland from the key posts in administration. By the way -- and just yesterday, she called for the DNC's head, Tom Perez to resign.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "GABBARD: I don't know why. You're a nice enough guy, Sean.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GABBARD: Voters in this primary need to have the confidence that their votes will be counted and their voices will be heard. And, unfortunately, he's had a failure of leadership in being able to uphold that faith and that trust. We've got a lot of primaries, a lot of elections between now and the convention. And we need to be able to get back on track.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HANNITY: I don't -- I could never understand that it was obvious that 2016 Democratic primary was rigged. It was rigged against Bernie Sanders.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And Donna Brazile when she took over for Debbie Wasserman Schultz had to call him one day and said, yes, you kind of got cheated.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, they want to change the rules so, oh, Bloomberg can get in debates.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HANNITY: And they want to change the rules and let superdelegates vote count on the first ballot, again to rig the primary. That's your party. That's not my party.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GABBARD: This is -- this is part of the problem. And this was post-2016 where a lot of people saw the problems with this system, with the superdelegates, with how hard it was for people to actually get out and cast their votes, to get their voices heard, that's driven a lot of the frustration that I'm hearing from Democrats with this process today.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You know, it's not only what happened in Iowa. Iowa voters really lost out in that whole situation, but it's also that decision that decision that, all of a sudden, the rules are changed to be able to benefit this billionaire Michael Bloomberg. And the decisions that the DNC has made throughout, unfortunately, to try to hold a preprimary before voters have even had a chance to go out and cast their votes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "There are bigger changes that we need. Superdelegates remains a concern. I've been a big advocate for getting rid of superdelegates altogether.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I give Republicans credit for this, they don't have superdelegates. They're trusting that the voters will make their choice.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HANNITY: See, I think you've been treated horribly. I think you're -- the things you have been saying about Hillary Clinton, I support you one. I thought it was courageous. Just acknowledging a simple truth that a president gets to hire and fire the people that he wants, not people that disagree with his policy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GABBARD: And actually, there's a deeper issue that not many people are talking about, which is it's not based on opinion. This is based on the Constitution.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You know, I'm a soldier. I'm still serving the Army National Guard and I took an oath --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HANNITY: Thank you for your service.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But as a soldier and as a member of Congress, I took an oath to our Constitution, as does every member of Congress. And it is the Constitution that provides that our foreign policy is set by the president of the United States, as well as in some significant ways by Congress, not by unelected Democrats and not by the military.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GABBARD: And the reason why our Founders had the wisdom in doing this, because they knew if voters were unhappy with the foreign policy decisions being made, they could make that decision at the ballot box to hire or fire, whereas they can't do that with unelected bureaucrats or others.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HANNITY: I mean, this is what makes you very unique in your party, to be very honest. One, you're courageous enough to come on other shows. And you're actually going to be seen by people. If you go on those other fake news networks, nobody will really see you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But on a serious note, this sticks in my craw. We heard Joe Biden say, you're not getting $1 billion until you fire the Ukrainian prosecutor who's investigating his son, who is being paid millions, who's on tape saying that he had no experience in oil, gas, energy or Ukraine.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Congresswoman, that sound good to you?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Look, Joe Biden will be held to the standard as voters --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HANNITY: He is not being held to it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GABBARD: As voters make this -- this is my whole point, is voters in this country, voters in the Democratic primaries here in New Hampshire, got a lot of independents and libertarians who are coming out to cast their votes tomorrow. They're going to make their decisions based on who they believe will best serve as commander in chief.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HANNITY: Last question, if you could call Donald Trump and say, even though we disagree on some things, I want to work with you on X, what would it be?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GABBARD: There is a long list.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GABBARD: I think there's far -- there's far more that we need to do one criminal justice reform.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "HANNITY: When we come back, the deep states, wow, huge news. Day of reckoning on the horizon. Senator Lindsey Graham pushing forward with the FISA probe. We have an update, and I will show you exactly what happened earlier today. Yours truly showing up, that's me, at a Joe -- that guy right there hated my guts. He did not like me, turned his back on me. We'll show you the tape and more, straight ahead.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Sara, let's go to the news aspect of this first, that you've been investigating.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first, we've got two major things happening right here in Washington, D.C., Sean. Two big events.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The first is that Senator Ron Johnson and Senator Chuck Grassley are asking William Barr to declassify four specific footnotes. Out of 500 footnotes in the Horowitz report, there is four of them that they say once it's declassified and made public will show that they contradict the assumptions made in Horowitz's report, basically on the Crossfire Hurricane when that investigation began. Remember, the FBI claims that they began the investigation July 31st.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The assumption is that once those four footnotes which are declassified now are declassified, it will reveal that the investigation actually began further back, and that those sources mentioned in Horowitz's report particularly Stefan Halperin and others that were connected with the FBI, we'll see a trail of that leading prior to July 31st. And it will kind of turn the whole Horowitz report on its head, stating that the Crossfire Hurricane was a reason for opening the investigation. So, that was one.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Number two, as far as Senator Lindsey Graham, the most important aspect here is finding out what happened with those FISAs. And one of the witnesses that they need to contact and they need to call and bring into testimony is actually Joe Pientka, who's the special agent that was working on the Woods Procedure that actually did not complete the Woods Procedure on the FISA that they took out on Carter Page.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HANNITY: Let me go, if I can, Congressman Steve Scalise.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We know there are referrals here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HANNITY: We also know this was premeditated fraud on a FISA court because there were multiple warnings. We also know that dirty dossier made up the bulk of the applications, Congressman Scalise, and that means that it's premeditated fraud on the FISA court, not only to take away all the constitutional rights and civil liberties of Carter Page, but to spy on the campaign, the transition team and the presidency.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We already have had referrals. Nobody gets indicted. It seems like you can lack candor or lie if you're a Democrat, but if you're a Republican, it's in different justice system.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCALISE: Yes, Sean, and, look, I've got deep concerns about this issue, and I have spoken. You know, I said, people need to go to jail for abusing -- for abusing the FISA court. Our intelligence agencies (ph) play a critical role in our national security, but some of those people abuse their power.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I talked to Senator Graham about this on the plane ride over here when we were coming over with the president in this rally.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "By the way, they would have loved you here at this rally in Manchester, Sean. A great crowd for President Trump.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But one of the things we talked about was, especially the Durham reports, and I think that's going to be critical to naming names. Not just talking about abuses because we know there were abuses. I've seen some classified information.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But I want to see actual names of people who use their position of power to try to spy on a candidate for president at the time in Donald Trump to take him down.

{"original": "It says: The bottom line is that if Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar remain in the race, despite having no path to appreciably collecting delegates on Super Tuesday and beyond, they will propel Sanders to a seemingly insurmountable delegate lead by siphoning votes away from Bloomberg with no upside for themselves.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And it's interesting because Amy Klobuchar's strong debate in New Hampshire is credited with helping her finish a surprising third place in the first- in-the-nation New Hampshire primary, so she might have some things to say tonight about Bloomberg's campaign gurus saying that she should drop out -- Neil.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "As you remind me, we're 3 percent into all the delegates that you need to win this thing, and they're already wrapping it up and concluding everything.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "All right, thank you, my friend, Peter Doocy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now to Jonathan Hunt. He is in Bakersfield, California, where the issue for the president right now may be water, but he is not taking his eye off what's happening in Nevada -- Jonathan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: That's for sure. Neil.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The president is expected here in about 45 minutes. We are here in the heart of California farming country. And as you take a look at the audience behind me, it's a very enthusiastic reception that awaits the president when he gets here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You might notice the desk on the podium there as well. That is because the president will be signing an Interior Department decision that is related to water rights. But the president began his day today, Neil, heading from Vegas, where he overnighted, to the Palm Springs area for fund-raising, millions of dollars, in fact, raised during a reception at the estate of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So he was among the wealthy there certainly in the Palm Springs area. A lot of supporters as he drove from the Palm Springs Airport to the Rancho Mirage estate of Larry Ellison.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Also a couple of protesters on the hand. Unlikely to be an issue when he gets here, where Mr. Trump will be seeking the support and, of course, the votes in election 2020 of ordinary farmers. As part of that, as I just mentioned, he's expected to sign off on an Interior Department decision that rolls back endangered species protections that have essentially curbed water deliveries to Central Valley farmers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So that's going to be a very popular move the president will make with the audience here. It will be very well-received. But as you were mentioning, Neil, as he makes this Western swing, the president very much is keeping his eyes on Nevada and that Democratic debate stage, which will be full of the candidates tonight.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Mr. Trump over the last few days has certainly seemed focused on the candidacy of former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg. And the president has been happy to echo some of Bloomberg's Democratic opponents concerns about the possibility or the accusation, at least, that Bloomberg is -- quote -- trying to buy the nomination away from the front-runner, Bernie Sanders.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Also, not unrelated to what is happening tonight in Nevada, the president will leave here, Bakersfield, California, and head to Phoenix, Arizona, where he will hold what will no doubt be another of those sold-out and raucous campaign rallies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "It is absolutely no coincidence, Neil, that that rally is scheduled to begin at exactly the same time the Democrats take the stage in Nevada. Mr. Trump knows better than anyone how to troll his opponents -- Neil.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: Or to steal some thunder.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "All right, thank you, my friend, Jonathan Hunt, in the middle of all that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So say it ain't so, Joe? There's a new report via CNBC that claims several Joe Biden fund-raisers are jumping ship and are now supporting Mike Bloomberg. All this as Biden is hoping to revive the campaign with tonight's debate in Nevada and obviously get things going again in South Carolina.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He is not on the ballot in either state, I might point out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "With me now is former Obama economic adviser, much more than that, Robert Wolf, GOP strategist Joseph Pinion, and The New York Post's Kelly Jane Torrance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Robert, you're well-connected with a lot of these same folks. Is it your sense that financial types are backing away from Biden? Aren't they going to wait this out or what?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ROBERT WOLF, FORMER ADVISER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA: I think they're going to wait it out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He was here next week -- last week. The events were sold out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: He didn't get as much as he hoped, though, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WOLF: That -- I don't know. I mean, what I heard from the campaign is they had a great first week post-Iowa.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: I think you know everything.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WOLF: You have to pay me more.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WOLF: I think the best way to look at it is, unfortunately for us Democrats, there is no one coalescing around one moderate candidate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "They're all somewhere between 10 and 20 percent. And whereas Bernie and Elizabeth Warren that take up about 40 to 45 percent of the party, right now coalescing around Bernie, which is around 30-plus percent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So I think we talked about the other day I certainly feel like the moderate side is a silent majority. But as long as we're doing what Obama said not to do, that good old circular firing squad we have going on right now...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: Well, it's alive and well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WOLF: It's no question about it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: So, when you look at it, Joe, I mean, how -- the president is planning just to sort of steal their thunder. Usually, he plans an event right up to that moment. No different this time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But it does steal their thunder, and I think he's enjoying their disarray.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "JOSEPH PINION, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Yes, look, I think he likes to give the side-by-side comparison.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So you have President Trump over here with six million new jobs, with wages going up, and you have Democrats over here. Iowa, they can't even count the votes. Now it looks like they can't even pick a nominee.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: But how is that even comparable? All right, so you have a problem in Iowa. It's not the same as the economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PINION: Well, I mean, again, I think that's the point, though.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We're over here running the country, and they're over here not even being able to take care of basic political business.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: What is their biggest worry right now? It always seems to me it could be Bloomberg. It was once Biden, because they really are pushing Bernie very hard.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PINION: Well, look, I think -- again, I think Republicans have to be careful what we wish for. Again, I think that when you look at somebody like Bernie, all the symptoms and signs are there for the same things that people said about President Trump, that he's only getting 30 percent of the vote, that there are more people voting for somebody...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: You know who the first person to remind me of that was you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: No, seriously, be careful jumping the gun on it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, I guess, Kelly Jane, what I'm looking at here is maybe a snapshot where it could be like a prize fight tonight. I don't -- sometimes they never live up to those expectations.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What do you think they're going to try to do to Bloomberg?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "KELLY JANE TORRANCE, NEW YORK POST: I think it's very interesting that people have been talking for years about how there's this battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party with Donald Trump and what happened.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: There's always a battle going on for the heart and soul of parties, though, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, right now, the two front-runners apparently are people who aren't even Democrats until very recently.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I think that we're seeing a lot of what they're going to bring up about Mike Bloomberg with all of the different audio that's been leaking on stop and frisk, on women, on people in the workplace.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: Have any of those been reflected in these polls that show him rising? Or is lot of that polling done prior to the release of these tapes?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "TORRANCE: I think most of it is done prior to the release.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I think also, though, I mean, stop and frisk, what he said on the tape was pretty awful. But people have known that he's been for that. And I think a lot of Democrats have already been worried about how he's going to respond to that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He apologized for it when he got into the race. But, for many, it wasn't enough. And let's face it. Joe Biden really needs something tonight, but he has never performed that well in any of the debates. And, in fact, most people who have done well in the debates did so when they were targeting Biden.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I'm thinking of Kamala Harris, of course, on the busing thing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: That worked out like a charm, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "TORRANCE: Temporarily. I mean, Biden's still going. She's out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, I say don't count him out. But, at the same time, right now, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is the one, of course, who has the most delegates. But nobody seems to think he can keep taking it in.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But, again, don't count him out. Everybody was surprised by his strong showing in Iowa.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, with the focus right now on Bloomberg tonight, he might regret accepting the invitation. Right? Or does he -- because it's been so widely telegraphed that he's going to be a pinata, what?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WOLF: I mean, you and I spoke about it the other night. We thought that his best possibility was don't go to the debate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But now I think we're at a point where he's had so many ads. You got to bring Oz behind -- in front of the curtain, all right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WOLF: I mean, we used to say with President Obama, you know what, get in front of the rope line, not behind the rope line.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He has to start getting out and making sure people know what he stands for.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: And Bloomberg is better than people think.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I know he has this intellectual approach to everything and sort of non- emotional. But he got elected three times in this city.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WOLF: And it's not a debate. Right? I mean, it's question and answer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PINION: Look, I mean, I think you look at somebody like Bloomberg, I mean, to me, I mean, there is a danger. I think somebody should still try to convince him not to go.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He's running the best funded art project in the history of American politics. And right now, he's basically the quarterback that held out of training camp, and he's showing up in the middle of the season, and everyone else is in midseason form.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So Amy Klobuchar is champing at the bit. You have individuals right now who are going to try to characterize him in ways that...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WOLF: I know a bunch of Democratic strategists that will hire you right now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: He's been very prescient on a couple of key developments here very, very early on.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: So, when you look at this and the media story, how is the media going to cover tonight?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "They're going to be looking to see if Bloomberg stumbles badly, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I mean, all eyes are on him. And I have to say, I'm interested to see which candidates really go after him. We know Elizabeth Warren already has on Twitter calling him an egotistical billionaire like Donald Trump, she said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But how hard are they going to hit him?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: How is he going to respond to that? What did she again? Like...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And that's -- I think you have to worry about egging and being condescending. Secondly, how hard are they going to go after him, when they all want his money? Even Bernie Sanders didn't say that he wouldn't take that $2 billion that Bloomberg is promising to spend, no matter who wins.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: Yes. We will see. We will see. They have to make nice for that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "All right. They can't go too far. We will watch it later on.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Meanwhile, just to let you know, again, for those of you just tuning in, we hit some records today at corner of Wall and Broad. I'm sure the Democrats will be mentioning this tonight, Nasdaq and the S&P at new highs, the Dow getting closer and closer to one.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But are the candidates in tonight's debate really promising to deliver something very different, something that has nothing to do with those market numbers?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: All right, well, they hike, and the strong economy just takes a hike -- that is kind of the message behind the Trump campaign in The Las Vegas Review-Journal, slamming the Democratic rivals over their tax plans, which to a man or woman, mean at least trillions of dollars more in taxes over the next 10 years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The only differentiator is how many trillions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Vince Coglianese is with us, Susan Li. We got Scott Martin.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You know what's interesting, Scott, about the way the president's positioning it, whatever you think of me, maybe whatever you think of my tweeting or whatever, take a look around you. Take a look at this strong economy. And just go with that. What do you think?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT: I love it. And he's right.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And it kind of is one of those situations, Neil, where the numbers and the results are speaking for themselves, not these grandiose, hopeful plans of how things are going to work out so great for everybody, when we all know, I mean, in economics, there are winners and there are losers, not everybody wins, but people strive to win.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And that's really the key behind a lot of the policies that Trump has introduced. And I think you just look around the Democratic side of things. We're going to learn more tonight. I mean, Mike Bloomberg alone on Wall Street, a major beneficiary of Wall Street, he was, and now he's got all these ideas that seemingly are going to take down Wall Street and penalize Wall Street for being as successful as it has been over the years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: Susan, the big drive for Democrats is, find us a winner. Find us someone who can beat Donald Trump. So they kind of put their passions aside in favor the candidate who can most and likely will embody that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "They're not quite sure about Bloomberg. How is that going down?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, on Wall Street, people are a little bit surprised, because, as Joe Biden pointed out, Bloomberg has been a Republican most of his life, meaning that he's a proponent of capitalism, lower taxes, less regulation, the trickle-down wealth effect, and now he's talking about a transaction tax on Wall Street, expanding the Volker rule, meaning more oversight for the banks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And this is counter to what he said 10 years ago, so they're hoping that maybe this is just before the primaries and he will move closer to the middle when the general election comes around, if he's still around.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: How do you think it's going to go for him, Vince, on that idea? I mean, Bloomberg is moderate in terms of some of the other candidates.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I think his costs are a few trillion dollars over 10 years, with Wall Street transaction taxes and the like, higher taxes on the upper income, but they're all going to raise taxes. So how does Bloomberg try to differentiate himself? Or can he?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "VINCE COGLIANESE, THE DAILY CALLER: Yes, I don't think he's going to satisfy the left-wing base at all with these policy positions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Even announcing tax raises of any kind on Wall Street, it's going to fall on deaf ears, because he's a -- he's not a credible communicator on that subject. He is seen in the Democratic Party as a guy who got filthy rich off of the finance industry.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And the big problem for him is convincing Democrats that he in any way deserves to be a part of this race, when the DNC clearly rolled out the red carpet and the velvet rope line for a guy who didn't even participate in the two first contests in this Democratic primary.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's what he needs to overcome. Saying anything about going after Wall Street, it's going to fall on deaf ears.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: All right, the president is fine with continuing to quote the markets and what they're doing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Scott, it's something that's very, very important to him. It's hard to gauge where these markets go the rest of the year and all of that, but normally, normally they're kind of indicative of what's happening in the economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "All seems pretty stable right now, the coronavirus uncertainties notwithstanding. Will that continue to be the wind at his back?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, you make a good point, Neil. Things seem eerily OK, don't they? And this is after a lot of things that this market and economy have had thrown at it. I mean, tariff wars alone, the Federal Reserve just about a year or so ago that was hiking rates, instead of cutting them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But, yes, overall, I think the economy has the wind at its back. And I think one reason we're seeing these record highs day after day, and we're going to see him probably tomorrow, too, after tonight's debate, you're going to see the Democrats continue to fray, and that's why the markets like it, because it gives Trump a better chance in November to pull this out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: Susan, when you talk to traders, what's their biggest worry like these days?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: I'm sure it's not a focus on the campaign. I'm sure it's the virus, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Well, Goldman Sachs just came out with a note saying that the market isn't really accounting for how big of an impact coronavirus might have, especially when you have China talking about an economic crisis.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That's where they're equating the epidemic to at this point. There are some concerns that people are not really pricing that in properly, with these record markets still.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: When you talk about record markets, and you talk about Michael Bloomberg being front and center, he's Mr. Market, he's Mr. Wall Street.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And, of course, he made the terminals that became ubiquitous and made him a guy worth $60 billion-plus.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, Vince, how does he handle that? Because he could end up sounding an awful lot like the president talking about Wall Street.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And he is transparently an oligarch. The dictionary definition is a guy who uses his financial resources to control political conversations, and that's what he's doing around the country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "In fact, tonight's debate will be interesting, because this is a liability for him. This is an opportunity for him to actually have to answer questions, instead of controlling the airtime that he has by way of the many ads that he's purchased literally everywhere.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I feel like when I go to sleep at night, my dreams just start with a Mike Bloomberg ad. He's done everything.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "COGLIANESE: Yes, it's unbelievable. I don't even know how he got to that. But that's what he's done.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "LI: Do you sleep well then?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: Well, that's the difference between your dreams and mine. Mine involve a Grand Slam meal at Denny's, but whatever works, whatever works.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "I'm curious. How are they handling you in Nebraska? Are you at a compound? What kind of a facility? Can you say?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So we thought we were being taken to an Air Force base. That's what they told us.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SERATTI-GOLDMAN: We were on our way after we were picked up at the airport, that's Carl that you're seeing right now on the TV.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, we were being taken away, and because, where we were, we thought we were on an Air Force base. We were not. And as we're driving, I said, this doesn't seem like an Air Force base. They go, oh, no, you're going to the Nebraska Medicine -- Medical Center.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SERATTI-GOLDMAN: And so they took Carl to the hospital portion of it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I'm in a -- I think there's only three in the country -- a specialty quarantine unit. And that's my room.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: How does it compare to the ship?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SERATTI-GOLDMAN: Not as luxurious. The luxury is not there, but I'm doing really well, really well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: Are you ever able to visit your husband?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "SERATTI-GOLDMAN: No. I cannot leave my room. I cannot leave my room.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And I still have tested negative and have no symptoms, so very blessed for that. And we were traveling with friends of ours from St. George, Utah.

{"original": "And that was the only sign she has had. And then she's been testing negative since she got to the hospital that she's in, Fukushima, Japan.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "So his immune system was already compromised. And that's why he has had a temperature a couple times.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "The reason that the press is connecting these pardons and commutations, not just the Stone case, but saying that Trump is -- he now says he's the nation's chief law enforcement officer -- is because of The Washington Post story saying that Bill Barr's threatened or at least has told people he might resign as attorney general if the president doesn't stop the tweets.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "LANKSTON: I don't think you need it.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "What's interesting here for Republicans who say Democrats are just wasting their time, they hope to succeed on issues like health care, which galvanize their takeover of the House in the midterms. They think it can repeat here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Beverly Hallberg joins us, The Independent Women's forum, and Jason Nichols, the Democratic strategist.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Beverly, the one thing you hear is that health care worked for us. It wasn't a wedge issue. It became the issue. And so, this way, we don't have to spend a lot of time talking about the jobs gains and everything else going on in the Trump economy. They're noteworthy. They're hard to argue again. So we're going to focus on this stuff, and maybe do better.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BEVERLY HALLBERG, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM: Yes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Well, I think health care is becoming that economic issue, because what voters really care about is for their costs to go down in health care. I thought it was very fascinating this week, when Bernie Sanders went around touting his Medicare for all plan, that even the Culinary Union said they weren't going to endorse him and even said, we like our health care, and we don't want you to take it away.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So I do expect, on the debate stage tonight, in addition to the billionaire Bloomberg bashing that is going to be an abundance, for them to talk about, some of the so-called moderates to talk about their alternative to Medicare for all. This is what Amy Klobuchar is talking about.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But, regardless, Republicans are going to have to start talking about their plans for health care moving forward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: Another thing that's interesting, Jason, from the Democratic perspective -- you're the expert here -- that the idea that Michael Bloomberg has not to really pick apart the economy and the numbers and the jobs gains and the markets, but to talk about, with that success and the money you can raise from these who've done very well, to get to these other goals.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "JASON NICHOLS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I think Bloomberg is going to struggle tonight.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "And it's going to be very difficult, when you recently said that you supported redlining, which basically destroyed African-American wealth. And then you say, OK, well, I have got a plan for that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I think that it's going to ring hollow for him. But I think health care is a winning issue for Democrats across the board. We know that the president's handling of health care, he's at about 30 -- in the 30 percentile area in terms of approval for the way he's handled health care.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We know he's supported federal lawsuits that basically will take away protections for preexisting conditions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: No, you raise a good point about how this could all sort out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But I wonder, Beverly, if there will be a limit to how aggressively they go after Bloomberg. After all, this is the same guy who has promised to write a check to help the nominee, to help the party. They don't want to go too far, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "HALLBERG: He's bought a lot of influence over the years, not just with local communities across this country, but some of those individuals he's going to be debating.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "What is fascinating is, his team has already come out and said that this isn't his forte. He's not great at public speaking. So they're already downplaying the expectations just a little bit. So, hopefully -- they're hoping, even if he doesn't have a super strong showing, it won't hurt him too badly in the polls.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But, from a messaging standpoint, I do think he needs to be on that more moderate level. But he is going to be attacked tonight, because he has been gaining in the polls.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: No, I think you're right. And keep the expectations low.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "On that, Jason, I built a career on it. So maybe he should try.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "How do you think it ends up tonight? I mean, they're fighting with each other, screaming at each other. They just endured the Iowa craziness and all. How are Democrats feeling?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "NICHOLS: I think people are feeling optimistic.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I think some people are a little worried that Bloomberg is going to buy this thing. But I think, Bernie...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: Well, if he did, would they support him? In the end, would they live with that if he were the nominee and support him?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "NICHOLS: I think that there would be an exodus of Bernie Sanders supporters, people who wanted to see Bernie Sanders, especially if he has the most delegates and the most votes at the end of the primary season.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: But most doesn't mean a majority. Right? You have to get that 1,991. If he doesn't have that, it's not a birthright. Right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "NICHOLS: It's not a birthright. But, still, in elections, the people who have the most votes should win.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And it seems like most of the party, I think, would support Bernie Sanders over somebody like Mike Bloomberg, who's really just pumping money into it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CAVUTO: All right, we will see. It's still early in the going. That's a whole 'nother show, a whole 'nother discussion.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Before the progressives, the dominant political thinkers in America were Madisonians. James Madison, who kept the notes at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787 -- notes that eventually formed much of the language of the Constitution -- made clear what the purposes of the Constitution were: to prescribe discrete areas of human endeavor in which the new federal government could legislate; to set forth open-ended areas of human behavior in which no government could legislate; and to leave the remaining areas of governmental endeavor in the hands of the states. The areas delegated to the federal government are only 17 in number and generally are referred to as federal powers. The areas in which no government may regulate are infinite and generally are referred to as natural rights.", "augmented": []}

They view Congress as a general legislature with no limits to its powers -- and they mean no limits. For example, in an area clearly beyond congressional reach, such as in-state highway speed limits, the progressives found a way to extend their reach. They offered money to the states to repave their highways, with the condition that the states adhere to federally prescribed speed limits (only South Dakota declined). Once the courts gave their imprimatur to this assault on the Constitution, the feds realized that by spending taxpayer dollars -- by bribing the states -- they could extend their regulatory tentacles to any extra-constitutional area they chose.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Progressivism's adherents finance the government by borrowing or by heavily taxing only the rich, both of which are sold as being painless to most voters.

Also, one of the newest members of President Trump's legal team, former federal prosecutor Robert Ray, is here to discuss the president's case. Then, Donald Trump Jr. here on the trial, the attempts to take down his father and the election year ahead. Plus, breaking news this morning into John Durham's criminal investigation into the FBI with Congressman Jim Jordan, ranking Republican on the House Oversight Committee.

We would use the Clinton model, where you take the record established in the House, let the House managers appointed by Pelosi make the argument.

{"original": "SEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS: Thank you, Maria. Good morning.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: So, this is the first time we will hear from the president. Of course, the president and the White House coming out with a statement last night ahead of the trial. Would you agree that this could be as shore as two weeks? What is your expectation?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CRUZ: I think it is certainly possible that this trial could last one to two weeks. On the other hand, if the Senate makes decision to go down the road of additional witnesses, that could extend it six, eight weeks, or even longer. So I think there are really two paths here. But what you just noted there is important. This week is going to be the first time in a year that the president has had the opportunity to defend himself, to lay out the facts, to lay out the law, to lay out the actual substance. We have seen months and months and months of a one-sided show trial from House Democrats, where they didn't want to hear from the defense, where they shut out the White House, where they shut out the minority. The good news is, in the Senate, what I'm confident of is, we're going to have a fair trial. We're not going to give in to the kind of games that House Democrats have played. Instead, we're going to give both sides a full and fair opportunity to present their case. The House managers will have every opportunity to stand up and to present their arguments, to put forth whatever evidence they have. But for the first time, the president and the White House defense team is going to be able to walk through the facts and substance. And I think that's a very, very important development.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: Let's talk about your reciprocity resolution. So if you were to go down the road of witnesses, you want it to be reciprocal. Tell us about that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CRUZ: Well, that's right. It's kind of strange how we got here. So Democrats have been having hearings, have been doing impeachment for months in the House. They brought in all sorts of witnesses. They blocked the minority from having any witnesses. And then, as soon as we get to the Senate, the Democratic talking point is, we want more witnesses. Never mind all the witnesses they called before. They want yet more. And they're trying to delay this. They're trying to drag this out. They want this trial to go on forever, because they have a political objective of attacking the president. What I have said and what I have urged the conference is, is, listen, if we go down the road of witnesses, we're not going to do what the House did. We're not going to have a one-sided kangaroo court. Instead, we're going to respect reciprocity. What does that mean? That means, if the prosecution gets a witness, the defense gets a witness. If the prosecution gets two, the defense gets two. That means, if the prosecution gets to call John Bolton, then the president gets to call Hunter Biden. And I got to tell you, the Democrats are terrified about seeing a witness like Hunter Biden testify, because they don't want to hear evidence of actual corruption, of corruption, potentially, of Joe Biden, corruption that occurred during the Obama administration. They blocked all those witnesses in the House. They're not going to succeed in blocking them in the Senate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If they want to go down the road of witnesses, that means the president enjoys the rights to due process, which means he can call witnesses and lay out his defense.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: What would that open up a whole 'nother can of worms? I mean, obviously, this whole focus on the president and this impeachment trial has put Hunter Biden and Joe Biden to the backseat. No one is actually talking about what went wrong there and why he accepted this money from foreign countries, leadership of foreign countries, while his father was sitting vice president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CRUZ: Well, Maria, you're right. And the Democrats desperately want to keep that topic off the news. And, sadly, an awful lot of folks in the media are very compliant with that. But that's why I said this week the president having the opportunity to defend himself is so important, because I think one of the fundamental defenses that I expect to hear from the White House this week is that the president has inherent authority and, in fact, a responsibility to investigate corruption. And when you look at what happened with Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, there is, at a minimum, prima facie evidence of corruption. You have got Hunter Biden getting paid $83,000 a month by Burisma, the largest natural gas company in Ukraine; $83,000 a month is a million dollars a year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CRUZ: Hunter Biden had zero experience in oil and gas. It's not like he was a geologist or geophysicist. He was getting that money, the obvious inference is, because his daddy was vice president. And Joe Biden is on video at the Council of Foreign Relations bragging that he blocked a billion dollars in foreign loans and foreign aid to Ukraine until they fired the prosecutor who was potentially investigating Burisma, the company on which Hunter Biden sat on the board. When -- if the Biden family is profiting to the tunes of millions of dollars, the president is entirely justified to say, let's investigate and find out what happened. That's why Hunter Biden is such an important witness and why the Democrats don't want to focus on, what was the evidence of actual corruption? I expect to hear a lot from that -- from the White House defense team this week.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: You have got a 51-vote threshold in terms of getting that vote to hear witnesses. Do you want to hear from witnesses? Then I want to get your take on the White House's letter sent last night, basically calling the articles of impeachment violations of the Constitution.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CRUZ: Well, starting with the second part first, I do think what we have seen coming out of the House is an abuse of the Constitution. And the reason is that they're using this for political purposes. This is the first time in history any president is alleged -- has been impeached without the articles alleging any criminal conduct at all, without alleging any federal crime was violated. They don't allege any federal law was violated. They don't even allege as much as that the president has a speeding ticket, and that has never happened in our country's history. And to use impeachment, like the House Democrats are doing, to express their political disagreement with the president, to try to overturn an election they're unhappy with, that is an abuse of the Constitution. Now, the first question you asked about process and witnesses, let me tell you what we can -- what we can expect to see in the next week or two going forward. On Tuesday, when we come back, the Senate will convene at 1:00 p.m. And we will start with pretrial motions. We will start with probably battling motions. What I expect the Senate to do is adopt a scheduling order laying out the next couple of weeks. That scheduling order is modeled after the scheduling order for the Bill Clinton impeachment. It's very, very similar. So it provides that we start with the House managers getting 24 hours spread over two days to present their case. They can argue evidence.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "They can argue law and argue whatever they want. After that, the president and the White House, they get 24 hours spread over two days to present their case. Then we shift questions from senators. Senators get 16 hours. Our questions have to be in writing, and the chief justice asks them for us. All of that, I would anticipate, takes about a week -- a week to a week-and-a-half. At that point, what the scheduling order provides is, the Senate is going to vote on whether or not additional witnesses are necessary. That's a 51- vote threshold. I don't know how that vote is going to come out. I think all 47 Democrats will vote yes. The open question is whether there will be four Republicans to join with those 47 Democrats. And, look, I think some of that depends on what happens in the first week- and-a-half, what arguments the House managers put forward, what arguments the White House puts forward, what questions comes out. I hope, at the end of the week-and-a-half, where Republican senators are is -- is, we have heard enough. The evidence they have put forward doesn't satisfy the constitutional standards. The Constitution says, impeachment lies for high crimes and misdemeanors.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CRUZ: This wasn't a high crime or misdemeanor. They didn't allege any crime at all. And so I hope, at the end of this process, that we will get at least 51 votes to say, let's move to final judgment. And when we move to final judgment...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CRUZ: ... the outcome of this is going to be, the president will be acquitted. The Senate will vote not guilty. And the reason I can say that with confidence is because, on their face, the articles of impeachment, they don't allege high crimes and misdemeanors. They fail on their face. And so I hope we get 51 votes in a week-and-a-half to say, this is over. If not, if not, if there are at least four Republicans who joined the Democrats for witnesses, then we're looking at a trial that will probably last six, eight weeks or longer...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CRUZ: ... because you have to assume there's going to be litigation over the witnesses, there's going to be delay.

The Senate is not going to do like the House and play political games.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "CRUZ: And the reason is, I think dismissing this cases is a much less attractive option than rendering final judgment and acquitting the president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CRUZ: And the reason is twofold. Number one, if you do a dismissal, a dismissal doesn't reach the merits. An acquittal, a verdict of not guilty, that verdict stands for all time. Nancy Pelosi is going out on TV crowing that the president has been impeached forever.", "augmented": []}

I am hopeful and I believe that senators will do their constitutional duty, which means that they're not going to decide this case based on friendship, but, rather -- there was a reason that the framers of the Constitution gave the responsibility of conducting an impeachment trial to the Senate.

He found that, based on manipulated search outcomes, biased search outcomes, that Google in 2016 shifted 2.6 million votes towards Hillary Clinton. Now, here's the interesting thing, Maria. Dr. Epstein is not a Republican. He is a liberal Democrat. He voted for Hillary Clinton. So, politically, he was happy to see more votes for Hillary. But he was horrified to see big tech have that kind of power. And he went on to testify what you just played, which is, if they do the same thing in 2020, which all indications are that they're going to, they could shift up to 15 million votes.

{"original": "RAY: Well, it's a big deal because, ultimately, in the eyes of history, we are all going to be judged about whether or not we acted in the best interests of the country. I think the president's principal defense -- and you saw it in the answer that was interposed over the weekend -- is very simple. This is an entirely partisan and, therefore, illegitimate effort by House Democrats to remove a president from office. And the remedy for that is the United States Senate, as envisioned by the framers of the Constitution. In order to overturn the will of the electorate in the 2016 election, and particularly given the fact that we are now in the middle of a presidential campaign for 2020, ultimately, that will can only be overturned with a bipartisan effort and overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate, with a two-thirds majority, in order to remove a president and overturn the will of that electorate. It's very simple.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "BARTIROMO: Well, let's look at the letter that the White House, your team, sent last night, because the conclusion of that letter from the White House, says: The articles of impeachment violate the Constitution. They are defective in their entirety. They are a product of invalid proceedings that flagrantly deny the president any due process. Ted Cruz just said the first 48 hours will determine a lot. What are you expecting?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "RAY: Well, I think he's right about that. But I think you have also saw from the speaker, Pelosi, about essentially celebrating the notion that the stain of impeachment exists and exists forever. And the only rejoinder to that -- and that's the rejoinder that it is my job, and together with the rest of the defense team, to place before the United States Senate for their consideration -- is the question about the rejoinder being that there will be an acquittal forever as well. And that's what we expect. That's the -- that's the task ahead during the next several weeks.", "augmented": []}

But before we ever get to that, I think the core issue -- and Senator Cruz alluded to this -- well-founded -- and I have said this many times -- many times on your show -- well-founded articles of impeachment both allege that crimes were committed and that those are the type of crimes that constitute abuse of the public trust. Abuse of power alone -- and history has shown this -- similar to also obstruction of Congress, those types of articles of impeachment have been tried on for size before, but they have not fared well. The core of the impeachment parameters allege that crimes have been committed, treason, bribery, and things like that, in other words, other high crimes and misdemeanors.", "augmented": []}

If the Republicans -- and some of them, the, let's call it weaker Republicans -- I sort of like the Rand Paul model -- make them vote on it. If some of those guys don't want to hear from the witnesses that we'd want to hear from, but we will hear from the others, I want to know about it, because they don't deserve to be in office. So it really depends. We have to play the game the way the Democrats have played the game. We have to play hard, but fair. Hearing from everyone is totally fair.

When I see Joe Biden talking to a group of 20 people with a teleprompter, because they're afraid of what he may say otherwise, that tells me all I need to know.

{"original": "JORDAN: Yes. No, I mean, look, they never expected him to do this. One of the great moves the president made is actually release the call transcript. The transcript itself shows no quid pro quo. The two individuals on the call, President Trump and President Zelensky, have repeatedly said there was no pressure, no pushing, no linkage of any type of investigation to the security assistance dollars. Third point, there Ukrainians didn't even know at the time of the call that the aid was on hold, that the aid have been paused. They didn't learn until about a month later from the Politico article. And the most important fact -- and this is one that the Democrats can never get past -- the most important fact is, the Ukrainians took no action, i.e., no announcement, no promise to start, no investigation, no announcement whatsoever about doing an investigation into the Bidens or Burisma to get the aid released. The aid was released because, over that pause time, that 55 days when the aid was paused, the president became convinced that Zelensky was a genuine reformer, and he decided to go ahead and release the hard-earned tax dollars of the American people to Ukraine.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: I want to switch gears ,ask you about what's taking place at the FBI investigation. Obviously, you have done an incredible amount of work in terms of exposing the wrongdoing in 2016 and possibly early 2015, actually. We know now that General Michael Flynn is going to be reversing his plea.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: Sidney Powell, his lawyer, says documents show prosecutors knew they pressed him to lie. Take a listen to this sound bite of Jim Comey on another network talking about the way he decided to send a few FBI agents over to the White House to question General Michael Flynn.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: I thought, it's early enough. Let's just send a couple guys over. We placed a call to Flynn, said, hey, we're sending a couple guys over. Hope you will talk to them. He said sure. Nobody else was there. They interviewed him in a conference room at the White House Situation Room, and he lied to them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: Sidney Powell says that this is strong inference that the prosecutors themselves conspired to cause Mr. Flynn to make false statements, basically encouraging him not to have a lawyer present. Don't - - we're just going to send a few guys over, as if it's a casual meeting.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "JORDAN: Yes. And one of them even -- one of the FBI agents even said they didn't think he was lying at the time. But they later then said that he -- that he did. Yes, they tried to set him up. They did set him up. But this is not unusual, because -- well, it should be unusual, but the FBI did it another time as well. They did it on January 6 at Trump Tower, when it was president-elect Trump. They went up there and briefed president-elect Trump on the dossier, the dossier they already knew was false. They went and briefed the president on it, so they could go then leak it to the press, and the press could write about it. And they tried to set up the president-elect of the United States in the same manner. So this is how they operate. And they got caught. Think about what Mr. Horowitz told us last month, Maria. He told us that the FBI, when they went to get the Carter Page warrant to spy on the Trump campaign, they lied to the court 17 times in the initial application and the three renewals; 17 times, they lied to the court. And now what's interesting, is Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, the two individuals who were in charge of that investigation, got in a little spat now with Rod Rosenstein, who was also involved.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "JORDAN: Yes. They were out to get the president. You had on Don Trump Jr. I thought it was a great interview. He said in impeachment started on Election Day. I actually think it started even sooner. I think it started on July 31, 2016, when they opened the Trump-Russia investigation, as I said, went and spied on four American citizens associated with the Trump campaign. And who was heading that investigation? Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, Peter Strzok, who said in one of those text messages, just went to a Southern Virginia Walmart. I can smell the Trump support. The disdain they have for the president and, just as importantly, the disdain they have for folks like you and me, Maria, who support the president, who voted for the president, that is what is so wrong. And then they get caught with these text messages. And now they're going to sue? This is ridiculous. The American people -- it's great that we -- those text messages were released, because the American can people can see the bias, the animus that these folks, who ran the two biggest investigations probably of our lifetime, the Clinton e-mail investigation and the Trump-Russia investigation, they can see the bias and the animus they had against President Donald Trump.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: Yes. And it's important to bring it up in terms of what took place in '16, because here we are on the doorstep of an impeachment trial of President Trump. Meanwhile, you know that there was collusion the Democrat side, Hillary Clinton paying for the dossier. That dossier partly came from Russia and came from Ukraine.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: If that's not collusion with the Russians, what is? And then there's obstruction that they also said that the president did, and yet Hillary Clinton destroyed documents, e-mails. She used a hammer and beach -- bleach to destroy her devices.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BARTIROMO: It's just extraordinary to me that this continues and goes unchecked.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "JORDAN: The best -- the best evidence that there was bias is, look at the names they gave the two investigations. The Clinton investigation, the code name they gave it was the Midyear Exam. But when it came to the Trump-Russia investigation, the FBI came up with Crossfire Hurricane. You can almost like see them pounding their chest like Tarzan. We're going to go get this president. We're going to go after Donald Trump. And that's exactly what they did. And never forget what Bill Barr said. Bill Barr said there was a crisis of leadership at the upper echelon of the FBI. That's the biggest understatement ever. Of course there was. Comey was fired. McCabe was fired, lied three times under oath. Jim Baker, chief counsel, had to resign. Lisa Page had to step down and resign as well, was kicked off the Mueller team, Peter Strzok kicked off the Mueller team and fired. So, those were the five key people who ran these investigations.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "JORDAN: There was a basis for my concern about the spying that happened. And then, third -- or, fourth, I should say, he used a term that should scare us all. He used the term political surveillance when he testified in front of the Senate Finance Committee. That's scary.

And we finally, the House, came up with two articles of impeachment, both of which are very weak. I will say this, and I will say it over and over again, because I think people must understand how important it is. Impeachment is a tool that is not meant to be used anywhere near a regular basis. Our founding fathers almost disliked it.

And that's where you are today. Your point about a lack of civic education is valid but I think the problem goes a little deeper. A lot of people we met were out and out Republicans but were also very isolated. They never traveled, in a lot of cases never got much beyond their own county. They had no idea of the outside world, except the military people. And for them the outside world was Iraq or Afghanistan. I'm not saying they were stupid, far from it, but they were very open to the kind of crap that Trump has peddled.

{"original": "WALLACE: Well, OK. Let me --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Let me ask you about some other things. You were a top member of", "augmented": []}

{"original": "WALLACE: -- nothing like with (ph) the policy under Donald Trump.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "MULVANEY: Chris, these are policy differences, OK? These are things that", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you think the country should look one way, we think it should look another.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "These are differences of style, the way the president speaks. Did he", "augmented": []}
{"original": "misspeak at Charlottesville? Yes. Should he have corrected it? Yes. Did he", "augmented": []}
{"original": "handle it poorly? Yes. But it was not something that people resign over.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "If you talk as a living, as you and I do, you're going to misspeak from", "augmented": []}
{"original": "time to time. It's inevitable. Those are not the type of things to give", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rise to resignations. In fact, I don't think anybody including John Kelly", "augmented": []}
{"original": "resigned during any of those. As I recall, John Kelly got fired and didn't", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Wednesday was different. And I hope that we focus on why Wednesday was", "augmented": []}
{"original": "different than something about a policy over immigration or a policy on how", "augmented": []}

{"original": "WALLACE: Finally, on November 7th, you pointed this out and I want to -- I", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Mick, how could someone who worked with the president so closely for three", "augmented": []}
{"original": "years be so wrong about who Donald Trump was?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "MULVANEY: Then clearly, something is different now than it was when you saw", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I wrote that article for a reason, because I've seen the examples. I think", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if you read the piece, I give a couple of examples. In there, I told (ph),", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this one is another example that I've never talked about publicly, which is", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that during the impeachment, the president tweeted something during the", "augmented": []}
{"original": "testimony and there was concern that it might rise to level of tampering", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I know a little bit about the law. I practiced law a long time ago. It", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wasn't that, but I was worried about the political impact of that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, I went to the president, privately, said, Mr. President, there's going", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to be a political problem. We need to fix this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "He looked at me, and said, OK, brought the lawyers down, talked to them,", "augmented": []}
{"original": "picked up the phone, called Kevin McCarthy. Brought Ivanka in, talked to", "augmented": []}
{"original": "them, talked to some of his friends in New York. Got a bunch of different", "augmented": []}
{"original": "opinions, and then fixed it, reversed course and did the right thing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "That was the president that we saw time and again. You saw him through the", "augmented": []}

{"original": "jobs to national security. And so I do think that there's a strong sense", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that confirmations have to happen immediately. And then paired with that is", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the question of additional COVID relief for Americans. He has talked about", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the $2,000 checks, getting more relief to small businesses, getting", "augmented": []}
{"original": "unemployment relief to people. I think that will be a first priority as", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Obviously, the vaccination program isn't really legislative. I think", "augmented": []}

{"original": "around the middle of both parties, to come together to help Biden get", "augmented": []}

{"original": "our health care system. You know, Joe Biden did not campaign on huge,", "augmented": []}
{"original": "radical change, he campaigned on working across the aisle to address things", "augmented": []}

{"original": "What does that tell you about Robert Mueller, special counsel, who the president keeps accusing of conducting a witch hunt, that he came out, one of his where statements to say this attack on the president is not true?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PENCE: Well, the president expressed his appreciation to the special counsel for clarifying that that report was inaccurate. But I think what it says more about is the obsession of many in the national media to attack this president for any reason, for any allegation, for any report in the media.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I mean, it was remarkable what we saw happening for 24 hours in the media on the basis of the report that appeared in BuzzFeed and I just think it's one of the reasons why people are so frustrated with many in the national media and the constant obsession on this -- look, this administration --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: If I may because I really want to move along here, what about the house Democrats, some of whom would say if true -- but if it's true, we need a resignation or impeachment?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PENCE: Again, the media's obsession on this issue --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: I'm talking about of Congress.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PENCE: And frankly, the reflexive willingness of the president's critics in the Democratic Party to accept the worst facts and the worst interpretation. Look, the American people expect better. This administration has fully cooperated with the special counsel, produced over a million documents, the special counsel will complete his work and we will have all the facts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The president has maintained he's done nothing wrong. The American people -- the American people ought to be confident that our administration is cooperating and frankly -- this was a week where I think the American people saw the hyper partisanship among Democrats to assume the worst about this president and many in the national media's willingness to assume the worst about the president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And the reality is what the American people want us doing, with the president sought to do yesterday with layer framework for where we could work together, let's start talking to one another.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Even though we are in a different studio, I'm going to try to move you along.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "President Trump has just announced another summit meeting with Kim Jong-un of North Korea for late next month. This week, the president said we have made, quote, tremendous progress with North Korea. On the other hand on Wednesday, you said we are still waiting for them to make, your words, concrete steps.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So, which is it? We made tremendous progress or since the Singapore summit last June, are we still awaiting any concrete steps? They don't seem to go together.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PENCE: Well, they go perfectly well together. Look, think about where we were two years ago. When the president and I took our oath of office two years ago today we had a regime in North Korea that was testing nuclear weapons, that was firing missiles over the Sea of Japan, making menacing statements against the United States and our allies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: But U.S. intelligence says they are still continuing to make more nuclear fuel and more missiles.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PENCE: No testing. What the president talks -- refers to, no -- because of his strong stance, and because of his engagement with Kim Jong-un directly at that first summit in Singapore, no testing of nuclear weapons, no firing of missiles. I had the great honor of being in Hawaii when the remains of our fallen heroes in the Korean War --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: But they are not denuclearizing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But to the point, and other president will be announcing details in the days ahead, the meeting that took place this week confirmed. There will be a second summit and at that summit, we will be laying out our expectation for North Korea to take concrete steps to begin to make real the denuclearization that Kim Jong-un committed to.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And, again, the president is very optimistic. The communications that I've seen between him and Chairman Kim have been truly remarkable.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: I've got one last --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PENCE: The president believes that we can make real progress and we are going to continue to strive forward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: I got one last question for you. This week, you defended the president's decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria and here's the quote. Normally in these circumstances, we'd have a sound bite.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We are bringing our troops home. The caliphate has crumbled and ISIS has been defeated.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But you were briefed before that statement about the fact that there had been this horrific suicide bombing that killed four Americans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Is that with the defeat of ISIS looks like?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "PENCE: Chris, first and foremost, our hearts go out to the families of those four American heroes and we are praying especially for them yesterday as there remains returned to Dover Air Force Base in presence of the president of the United States.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But look, the progress that we have made against ISIS since this president came into office has truly been remarkable. After President Obama withdrew American forces from Iraq in 2011, we literally saw this ISIS caliphate rise up and overrun vast areas of Syria and Iraq that had been won by the American soldier. President Obama began the process of a bombing campaign two years later.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But President Trump changed the rules of engagement. He told our military, his commander in chief, to go after them, and our soldiers and the Americans in the fight along with our allies have literally crushed the ISIS state.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, as I also said in that same meeting, the president made the decision as commander-in-chief to hand off the fight against ISIS in Syria to our coalition partners. We are working, in the process of doing that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The president wants to bring our troops home, but recognize there are remnants, there are ISIS fighters still in the region. But we've taken back 99 percent of the territory that the caliphate had claimed. In a very real sense, the ISIS state has been defeated, but we will not rest or relent until we drive ISIS not only from the region, but from the face of the earth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Mr. Vice President, thank you. Thanks for talking with us and thank you especially for switching signals, instead of going to one place, coming here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: You really saved our bacon, thank you, sir.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Up next, how Democrats will respond to the president's offer. Is it enough to end of the nearly one month government shutdown? We'll talk to the number three Democrat in the House, House Majority Whip James Clyburn. That's next.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: The president offered concessions to the Democrats this weekend, but as we told you when our interview with Vice President Pence, they rejected it before the president even officially made his offer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We're going to be talking now to get reaction from the number three Democrat in the House, Jim Clyburn of South Carolina.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Congressman, welcome back to Fox News Sunday.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "REP. JAMES CLYBURN, D-S.C., HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP: Thank you so much for having me, Chris.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Why flatly reject the president's offer, which, yes it calls for more money for the wall, but on the other hand it does offer temporary protection for the Dreamers, temporary protection for those TPS refugees and would reopen the government? Why not sit down and negotiate? Isn't that a reasonable opening offer?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLYBURN: Well, thank you so much for having me.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "You know, what we are trying to do here is get the government open, and what we said to the president is, let's open up the government, we could do that, as you said, tomorrow morning. He has bills that he could sign and could open the government up right away. Let's not hold the American people, especially the federal workers, hostage to these negotiations, and hopefully, we will open with what he has put on the table.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And let's go back and forth on this and see where we can find common ground. We are all for negotiating and we would love to have a permanent fix for DACA and TPS, just as he wants a permanent wall.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I think it's a nonstarter for him to ask for a permanent wall and for us to have a temporary fix. Just think about what happened to DACA children. If you're finishing high school and get a temporary three year fix, it means by the time you got to your junior year of college, you are under threat of having this rug (ph) pulled out from under you, never being able to finish school, just as the president did when he came into office and got rid of what President Obama had done for DACA recipients.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And so, this is the kind of stuff we want to sit down and put some stability in people's lives and have some permanent solutions to this immigration problem. And the president's team is the one who continues to play games with us. He gets a permanent fix for his wall and we get a temporary fix --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Yes, so, I just want to make sure bottom line, are you saying no negotiations until the president reopens the government, and are you saying, as Speaker Pelosi does, under no circumstances, no money -- new money for the wall?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLYBURN: No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying yes to the first part. To the second part, it seemed as if the president started talking about barriers in a statement yesterday. And as you realize, I have been talking about barriers for a long time. A smart wall will be a barrier. A smart wall would be using drones, using sensors, using X-ray equipment to be an effective wall.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Not just something that would be a monument to one's existence, but to be a deterrent at the border and to be an effective barrier for people who are trying to come in illegally. And while we're doing that --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLYBURN: -- let's fix our ports of entry. Yes?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: OK. I was going to say is look with the president is offering on his side.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Protection, yes, temporary, but protection for the Dreamers and TPS refugees. More money for immigration judges, more money for border patrol, more money for detention beds, humanitarian support and drug detection technology.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Don't Democrats and up looking like you don't care about border security and that you don't want to reopen the government?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLYBURN: Well, I don't know how it may look to someone but all I would ask is look at the billion dollars that was put on the table before the president had his statement on yesterday -- $450 million for hiring new judges, hiring new personnel, border policeman, and another $550 billion for ports of entry, for having the infrastructure that we need.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So that is already on the table. So, I don't know if the president did anything that was new. All he did was regurgitate the stuff that we have already given him in the past several months.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: But just to make clear, you're saying no negotiations, no compromise until he agrees to reopen the government, is that correct?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLYBURN: That's absolutely correct. I can't see us keeping federal employees, 800,000 people out of work while we go back and forth on negotiations. These negotiations could take three or four weeks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "We ought to open the government up. We can pass a continuing resolution for 30 days, get the government open. Get people back to work. And then let's sit around the table and see where the common ground is. It may be just a simple as taking temporary off the TPS fixes and I would hope that his TPS fix will include those countries where I find my roots, where he seemed to be so dismissive of some time ago, and that is Haiti, African countries, temporary protected status for all people seeking to come to this country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Congressman, I want to switch to two other subjects before we let you go. First, BuzzFeed. Special counsel Robert Mueller, as I just discussed with the vice president, knocked down the BuzzFeed story that the special counsel had evidence that the president directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Now, as soon -- before he did, before he knocked the story down, House Democrats jumped on the story.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I want to read a couple of the quotes from what they said. Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, said: We don't know if it's true, of course, but already, people of course are saying this is the matter of the gravest urgency.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "David Cicilline said, congressman from Rhode Island: If true, this is I think the most serious threat to the Trump presidency that we've seen so far.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Should your members be more cautious, because it almost seemed in this rush to judgment as if there were a lot of House Democrats that want to impeach the president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLYBURN: Well, Chris, when you preface her statement with if this is true, that, to me, gives you all the cover you need. And I would say that. If it is true -- now, if they had said something as if it were true then that would be one thing to be concerned about, but they've all said if this is true. There are a lot of things that I hear daily. If it were true I would be concerned about it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Sometimes, you would preface it with that and sometimes you just don't say anything.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So I don't think that my Democratic friends in any way rushing to judgment because the qualified right upfront, if this is true.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: All right. I want to talk to, this week and, of course, is Martin Luther King weekend. You're going to be speaking tomorrow in the state capital in Columbia on an observance of Dr. King's birthday. Some members, Democrats who are potential candidates in 2020 are going to be there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "A couple of questions, first of all, is there anybody so far in this crazy field that could be as many as two dozen candidates, is there anybody that stands out for you? And more importantly and specifically, is there any one of them who you think could advance Dr. King's legacy?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "CLYBURN: Oh, quite a few of them could advance that legacy. I think -- I don't know who all is going to run but you've got people like Joe Biden, who spends a lot of time in South Carolina.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Joe Biden has demonstrated a commitment to Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy. You've got Cory Booker, Kamala Harris. These are three people that I've seen and heard from mostly in South Carolina.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "But Eric Swalwell was here last night. We have others who will be coming very soon. I talked with Kirsten Gillibrand. I think she told me that she's on her way to South Carolina.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I worked with all of these people. I think they are outstanding people. They will make great public servants. They already are great public servants.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And so, any one of them would do a good job of pushing that legacy. Remember, in fact, I will be talking about this tomorrow, I've told people a lot, aside from the bible, I think one of the most timeless documents I've ever read in my life was Martin Luther King Jr.'s letter from the Birmingham City Jail. I've read that letter about 100 times.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I read it again, not all of it, but I read some of it again last night. And what jumped off the page at me is injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, and that reminds me so much of what we are going through today. The injustice that we see taking place at our southern border, the injustice that we see taking place in fair housing. These things are things that Democrats have been pushing for us to get fixed and I think that anyone of these candidates would be good messengers for that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Congressman Clyburn, thank you. Thank you so much for joining us today and we'll, of course, be following what happens next in this shutdown. Thank you, sir.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Robert Mueller's office breaks its silence to knock down that BuzzFeed story that President Trump ordered his former fixer to lie to Congress.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER: People tell me, by the way, that you were the first person to notice the fire.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Speaker -- well, we could all smell it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "How damaging is the BuzzFeed story and the almost total knockdown by the special counsel to the media?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GINGRICH: Well, it comes on top of the previous week's New York Times story that such Trump could be a Russian agent, until you get to paragraph nine when it said, actually there's no proof at all that this story is true. I mean you had this continuous --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: This was a story that there was a counterintelligence investigation by the FBI.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GINGRICH: Right. Yes, and then they said they found nothing and it's not true.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Right. That he was a Russian agent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GINGRICH: Trump said about 90 percent negative. And I did tell him -- he tweeted about this. I said to him, I think he's had the worst media hostility since Lincoln. I think you cannot find any other president who has been a relentless and ending assault, much of it dishonest. And, of course, Mueller, frankly, saved my bacon because I was on Fox and Friends and had not seen the report and they said, well, what about BuzzFeed, and I said it's a lie. And luckily it turned out Mueller said, yes, it's not true.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Yes, you did say it was a lie.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, as I discussed with Congressman Clyburn, as soon as this story came out there was this almost rush to judgment -- I'm going to get back to the media, I promise, Guy, but there was a rush to judgment by a lot of Democratic congressman. And, yes, they said if true, but they almost seem to want it to be true.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I just want to read one piece of sound here, but we don't have any sound, so I'll read it to you. Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas, if the president directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress, then that's a clear case of participating in perjury and obstruction of justice and he should resign, but if he doesn't resign, he should be impeached.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Does that hurt the credibility of the Democrats in Congress in the House that before they even knew whether this was true -- yes, they did say if it's true, but, man, we're already talking about impeachment and resignation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "DONNA EDWARDS, D-MD., FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN: Look, I think that what you are really from the Democratic leadership and from the House chairmen and women who will really control this agenda is you actually hear a little restraint saying, let's wait until the report is issued. And one of the reasons is because there have been so many multiple reports of supposed information coming out and around the Mueller investigation. And really what we've learned is through indictments, we've learned through court proceedings, but we don't really know what Robert Mueller has. And I think it's really important for us to wait for that investigation to complete itself and move (ph).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: So do you think some of your former colleagues made a mistake?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "EDWARDS: Well, I -- you know, what, I -- as I think the speaker has said, she is not the language police. She is not the one who can police all of the comments or other -- of members. And they did preface it with, if it's true. But what you hear from the leadership is, we're going to wait for the Mueller report, and that's been pretty consistent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "I do think that there are things that are outside of the Mueller investigation, in other courts, in other jurisdictions, that actually could give rise to consideration of investigation for impeachment in the House of Representatives, the Robert Mueller report, the Russia investigation has not come to that fruition yet.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Guy, as somebody said the other day, the worst thing that can happen is -- in our business is to have an exclusive that stays an exclusive --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Meaning that nobody else corroborates it. And as you know, everybody on Friday was rushing like crazy trying to say, all right, you know, they've got it, is it true, and we couldn't get it and eventually it was knocked down by the special counsel.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "How damaging do you think this is to the credibility, not just of BuzzFeed, but of the media in general?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BENSON: Well, it's a black eye for BuzzFeed. There's no question about that. And, you're right, this story hung out there for hours and hours and hours and then into the next day. And beyond just that, another thing that smelled a little fishy was the two journalists who reported the story seemed to contradict each other the next day about whether or not they had seen the supposed documentary evidence that allegedly backed up this explosive claim. One said we didn't see it. One said they did. That was odd.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And then, of course, the statement comes out from Mueller. I think broadly speaking, about the media, there was a sense of palpable disappointment among many of our colleagues in the mainstream media. They wanted so badly for this to be true. This was finally the one that was going to get the president. And watching them sort of gravel with that extraordinary statement from Mueller in real time was sort of entertaining.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Why do you think Mueller, who has been so silent this whole time, that he felt he had to come out and knocked down this story?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "BENSON: Because it was so explosive. And I think that the president was going to be damaged by the story even being out there. And I think to his credit, he decided that he wanted to set the record straight. I think he enhanced his own credibility here by saying, look, I am a fair-minded person. I don't want the president to be treated unfairly. I think it's very hard to argue that this is a witch hunt after the special counsel did precisely what he did this week, which is the right thing to do.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Speaker Gingrich, I don't want to bring back old, bad feelings, but you and Republicans paid a price for the impeachment of President Clinton back in 1998.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "GINGRICH: Well, you've put me in an awkward position here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: Well, that is kind of what I'm paid to do.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GINGRICH: Well, look, I would say, first of all, everybody should read Jimmy Breslin's How the Good Guys Finally Won, which is about Tip O'Neill and Watergate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And the mistake I made was not following Tip's leadership. Tip was very cautious. He was very careful. He kept it as non-partisan as possible. He brought Peter Rodino in, who people thought was a very fair judiciary chairman, and said, do the right thing the right way. And I think that we got a little too involved in personal feelings about Clinton himself and in -- in the whole way that the report came out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "At the same time, you know, the president, and to be defensive for a second, President Clinton did lose his license to practice law. He did have to pay a fine. I mean there were a lot of things going on there that were complicated. But I think that the challenge for the Democrats and the media is, there's very high likelihood that nothing's going to happen that leads to conviction. I mean as we discovered, you know, to impeach in the House is one thing, but then you've got to get a conviction in the Senate. And there is zero possibility that this Senate is going to convict.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: All right, I got less than a minute left.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Congresswoman Edwards, is there anything that Speaker Gingrich said that you think maybe we should follow that advice?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "EDWARDS: Well, I mean, I do think that Speaker Pelosi has indeed been exercising the kind of restraint that Speaker Gingrich is indicating.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: But she's having a little trouble with some of her members.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "EDWARDS: But she is the leadership.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "EDWARDS: And she's the one who's going to decide ultimately how and whether this goes forward. And I think that she has said she's waiting for the Mueller report to come out. I think that that's a responsible thing to do. And, you know, the other members have to decide for themselves what it is that they're going to say about it along the way.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: All right, we have to take a break here. But when we come back, President Trump announces a second summit with North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un. We'll discuss chances for a breakthrough.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about how the feud between President Trump and Speaker Pelosi is affecting prospects for ending this shutdown and reopening the government? We'll get to all of that in the next segment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: President Trump making an offer to Democrats yesterday in exchange for border wall funding and an end to the government shutdown.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "And we're back now with the panel.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Well, Speaker Gingrich, what do you make of the president's offer, and given the immediate rejection by Democrats, does it do anything to break the logjam?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GINGRICH: Well, I think it does a lot, and particularly because Senator McConnell has already said he's going to move it in the Senate. And I have suspicion that they have the votes to get that out of the Senate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: You think they have seven Democratic votes?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GINGRICH: I think they do. That's my guess. There's a -- the White House is very optimistic that they listed carefully, that when you add in help for the dreamers and you add in help for the people who are on the refugee status --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: That was temporary, we've got to say, three years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GINGRICH: Yes, well, but three -- but three years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GINGRICH: Well, three years compared to zero is a lot. And I think in addition, I think the pressure from 800,000 families to get this government reopened and their salaries paid is very real. So I think there are a number of people -- I've already seen individual Democrats who have said, yes, I could vote for the wall if that's what it takes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "So the challenge for Speaker Pelosi is real simple, she's -- she should be challenged to bring up her bill and to allow Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader, to have a substitute and see whether or not there are 25 or 30 Democrats who side with McCarthy because her bill will not be signed into law and will not, in fact, be taken up by the Senate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: And -- and what you think of -- and we heard from Clyburn, again, we've heard it from Pelosi, we've heard it from Hoyer, we heard it from Clyburn this morning, no negotiations until you reopen the government?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "GINGRICH: Right. Well, first of all, it's a nonstarter. They don't accept the fact that whether they dislike him or liken him, Trump is the president. And as president he can veto anything he wants to. And, furthermore, he has a Senate majority leader, McConnell, who won't even take up the bill unless he'll sign it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Second, I served with Reagan. Tip O'Neill didn't help Reagan. Tip O'Neill would bring a bill up, he would allow a Republican substitute. The original tax cuts were a bipartisan substitute and -- because O'Neill understood he could be defeated on the floor and his left wouldn't be that mad. But if he personally compromised, they would have killed him. Pelosi can't compromise. You -- you've got two years now of her screaming no. But what can happen is a bipartisan majority can run the House.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "WALLACE: OK. All right. We'll bring Congressman Edwards in here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Here's what President Trump said yesterday about Speaker Pelosi. Walls work and we need walls and whether it's personal or not it's not personal for me. She, Pelosi, is being controlled by the radical left.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Did the president, yesterday, make an offer that Pelosi can't refuse or an offer she can't accept?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "EDWARDS: No, I mean, it -- this was not an offer in compromise. Let's look at it. It was funding for a wall that Democrats and the majority of the American people oppose. It was temporary reprisal and temporary protective status and -- for the -- for the dreamers, something that the president took away. And so you don't give back something that you took away and -- and say that that is an offer in compromise.", "augmented": []}

But I think that it also helps to have him meet with the president and understand how firm we are on these things. And I think that Secretary Pompeo's been very clear about this as secretary of state. So I -- I don't regard this as a boondoggle or as a mistake. I, frankly, expected it to happen.

Liberals just can't come to grips with the fact that spending a lot of money to participate in the political process doesn't equal corruption.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "Instead of jobs, health care or border security, the incoming Democrat majority in the House is making a so-called reform package their first legislative priority in the new Congress. The bill consists of speech-stifling regulations under the guise of campaign finance reform, voting reform that puts automatic voter registration ahead of election integrity, and the overtly political action of income tax return disclosure that applies to the president but not Congress. It should be noted that this effort has a zero percent chance of passing the Senate, much less being signed into law.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The Democrat campaign finance plan dusts off their decades-old dream for the public financing of political campaigns. This excessive spending could go a long way toward paying for a border wall and enhanced border security. Curiously, this bill appears not to directly address the large amounts of money being raised and spent by Super PACs that liberals complain about ad nauseam. Maybe that's because Democrats employ Super PACs to get their message out just as much as Republicans. According to a recent column in the Los Angeles Times, Among the top 25 super PACs in 2018 spending, through Dec. 3, contributions supporting Republicans and conservatives came to $341 million; contributions on the Democratic and liberal side totaled about $282 million.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "Additionally, only a hypocrite like Hillary Clinton - in collusion with her allies in the liberal media - could get away with making overturning the Citizens United decision her number one legislative priority in 2016 while spending nearly twice as much as Donald Trump. Liberal hypocrisy knows no bounds, but it only gets you so far. If the Democrats truly wanted to get rid of Super PACs they could make them obsolete by getting behind measures like Senator Ted Cruz and Congressman Mark Meadows' bill, the Super PAC Elimination Act.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "The Democrat reform package includes an election reform section to fix something that isn't the problem. The bill argues we need to make it easier to vote, despite just witnessing record turnout in the 2018 midterm elections.

Furthermore, early reports are predicting more record turnout in 2020 with encouraging headlines such as, Expect Record Turnout in 2020. This begs the question; shouldn't the priority be ballot integrity, to ensure that only those persons eligible to vote actually get to vote?", "augmented": []}
