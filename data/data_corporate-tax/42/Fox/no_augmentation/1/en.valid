In light of the urgent humanitarian and security crisis on our border, the president is requesting $5.7 billion for physical barriers and border security, McConnell said.

In a February letter to President Trump, the Ebony Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to combating mass incarceration, argued that Kilpatrick's lengthy sentence was not appropriate for his crimes.

It wasn't until the 2010 elections — when I first ran for Senate — when Americans overwhelmingly rejected Obama's agenda and took back control of the House that Republicans in Congress could prevent further damage.
He filed another motion in 2017 to vacate his prison sentence, which was denied by a district court judge, the station reported.
And make no mistake, the two Democratic candidates — Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff — have no business representing any state in Congress. Despite the legacy media's attempts to bury any negative evidence of their checkered pasts, it's clear that both Warnock and Ossoff are wholly unqualified to be U.S. senators. Georgia voters would be right to reject their candidacies outright even if the balance of the Senate wasn't on the ballot.

That's a reference to Christie's prosecution of Kushner's father, Charles, while Christie was U.S. attorney for New Jersey in 2005.

There is no opt-out provision, and there are no private health plans, as competition with the government would be illegal.

While the public school system claimed it only spent $12,073 per pupil in 2017, this number excludes the cost of buildings and other depreciable assets. A study noted that were these expenses to be included, the per-pupil cost would more than double the official figure. In other words, the lousy education that Los Angeles public schools provides actually costs taxpayers more than sending students to most private schools.

Cohen is likely to try to portray himself now as a redemptive sinner – an act that is almost an affront to sin. For those who have long been critics of his infamous career (and the failure of the New York Bar to take action against him), the act will be as infuriating as it is unbelievable.

And so then when they see Trump at the State of the Union recite this litany of great things one after the other -- a strong economy, an economy that is disproportionately benefiting the working class and African-Americans and other minorities, it's almost as if, how can that be? And so a certain kind of dissonance I think creeps in which you are forced to deny the facts in order to support the hypothesis that you have been force-fed over many, many years.

More importantly, Cohen's allegations concerning the payoffs have some independent corroboration. Hush-money payments were made to Daniels and to another woman alleging an affair with Trump.

So this was one of those coming together moments. And Bloomberg has got the money.

Administration figures show that 161,000 family units crossed the border in fiscal 2018, a remarkable 50 percent increase from the year before. Homeland Security officials have also said 60,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border last year, a 25 percent increase.
