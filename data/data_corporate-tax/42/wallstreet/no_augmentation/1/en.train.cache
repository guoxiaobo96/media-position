If you're doubting if someone with income in those ranges is wealthy, consider that the median household income in the U.S. is $55,775 and, even in expensive San Francisco, it's $90,500.
This got me to thinking: If these lists are so effective, why do we need a fresh set of them every year? Two answers come immediately to mind. First, investors are fickle and easily dissuaded by their emotions, compelling sales pitches and of course the ups and downs of the markets. Second, many of the items on these lists are vague and fail to tell people what they should actually do.
Other advisers share this point of view. Once retired, if retirees have funds in a traditional 401(k), Roth 401(k) and HSA, they can effectively manage their tax bracket by making withdrawals in a tax-efficient manner, said Westley.

A trade war with China remains a distinct possibility. The terms of the U.K.'s exit from the European Union, or Brexit, have yet to be determined. France is dealing with anti-government street protests, triggered by an announced fuel tax, since abandoned, and a push for a higher minimum wage. Italy and the European Union, which were at loggerheads over Italy's budget, have come to some kind of an agreement that will allow Europe's fourth-largest economy to avoid sanctions for now.
There's good reason to believe that the tax cut had almost no impact on business investment. Rather, it was strong demand, especially for oil, that encouraged businesses to expand capacity. Now investment is softening along with aggregate demand.
U.S. equity funds remain the most popular ETF category by far, in terms of volume. However, other categories saw much faster growth over 2016. While volume for U.S. equity funds rose 19% in 2016, international equity funds grew 55% while fixed income ETFs had volume growth of 68%. Commodity-based funds saw the biggest volume uptick, growing 172%, according to Credit Suisse.

Are you being foolish? On the contrary, you are being smart. If your family members want to help you financially, why not ask them for items that you need: Patio furniture, an ironing board or rug; these items will also make the family feel less like they have a stake in your house. Giving money to family members can also create jealousy among those who like to keep score. Some children, like Sarah in Washington, D.C., believe that they are automatically entitled to their parents' money, for instance. Nice as it is to get a helping hand, we are not entitled to our family's money.
In 2009, the company honed in on the mobile Internet sector, investing $15 million in the travel website Qunar.com. Two years later, Baidu paid $306 million for a 62 percent stake on the travel booking site. As an investor with stakes in both companies, Foo played a key role in negotiating the deal. This paved the way for Qunar to raise $167 million in a public listing on the Nasdaq in 2013.

Rosengren: No, I wouldn't phrase it that way. Our dual mandate goal would be that we have to get to 2% inflation and get to what we believe is a sustainable unemployment rate. The unemployment rate right now is at 4.1% so we're already lower than where we think we need to be. My own view is what the sustainable unemployment rate would be more like 4.7%. If you look at the Blue Chip forecasts, which just came out, they are actually getting it down to 3.7% in 2019. So we are actually moving in the opposite direction. I do think that we have to gradually tighten and I don't want to overshoot on the unemployment rate so much that it becomes very difficult to get back to a sustainable unemployment rate without having a recession.

Fewer investors think of rebalancing as a retirement income strategy. A lot of investors try to construct a retirement income check from investment earnings alone, but it isn't necessary — or most efficient. You'd need a portfolio of $2,000,000, for example, invested in the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% today to generate $40,000 in dividend income. For many people a more feasible strategy is to consider a diversified investment approach instead — and rebalance.
The gains have almost literally been nonstop. Of the 10 trading days in 2018 thus far, both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have risen in eight of them, while the Dow has gained in seven of the 10 days. All three have hit repeated records and powered through multiple milestones; the Dow topped 26,000 for the first time ever on Tuesday, though it subsequently retreated from that level and ended in negative territory for the day.

In the U.S., the combination of Trump and a succession of new asset-price records — call it Trump-squared — has been sustaining the illusion underpinning current market optimism. For those who are not too stressed from having taken extreme positions in the markets, it will be interesting (if not profitable) to observe how the illusion morphs into a new perception, one that implies very different levels for speculative markets.

Today, there is significantly more demand for bitcoin than there is supply. About 900 new bitcoin are mined daily, and three market participants alone — PayPal, Square, and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust — purchase considerably more than 900 bitcoin a day because of high investor demand.

Meanwhile, price-to-earnings multiples have suffered amid the recent volatility, with strong earnings and a negative return combining to leave 2018 with the third biggest annual fall in P/Es over the past four decades, Schulze noted, exceeded only by 2000 and 2002. The fall left the P/Es, a popular measure of valuing stocks, near five-year lows. In particular, the pressure has been concentrated in cyclical sectors, which might be poised for the biggest positive surprises if growth holds up.

That's forward thinking and generous of you. Setting up trusts for them and depositing money in those trusts on a yearly basis (up to $14,000 in 2015 without having to file a gift tax return, although there is a gift tax exclusion for education) would also reduce the size of your estate and the taxes that will fall due upon your death.

3. Markets will remain volatile, as investors are still wary of adverse economic developments and often overreact to same. It's best to have an investment policy that specifies, in advance, what will occur if the stock, bond, real estate or commodities markets (or any other asset class the investor possesses) goes up or down significantly in value. This disciplined approach to rebalancing an investment portfolio pays off.

4. Growth stocks are much more significantly overvalued at present, relative to value stocks. And large-cap stocks have outperformed small-cap stocks over about the last five years, as well. Given this, a long-term allocation of part of an investment portfolio to U.S. small cap value stocks makes sense. Emerging markets stocks are another area that appears to have lower values, relative to other stocks. While volatile, an allocation to emerging markets stocks for a small part of an investment portfolio could significantly add to returns over the long term (10 years or more), provided rebalancing of the portfolio occurs periodically.

The Biden tax plan would increase the maximum refundable child credit to $4,000 for one qualifying child or $8,000 for two or more qualifying children. Families making between $125,000 and $400,000 would receive reduced credits. Apparently, the same rules would apply to an enhanced credit for expenses to care for qualifying dependents.

Your costs for long-term care could be catastrophic, nonexistent or somewhere between. About half of the elderly won't have to pay for long-term care, the Vanguard study estimated. This group either won't need help or will have unpaid caregivers such as a spouse or adult child.

For wages paid in tax years beginning after 12/31/17 and before 1/1/20, the TCJA allows employers to claim a tax credit equal to 12.5% of wages paid to qualifying employees while they are on family or medical leave — as long as the employee is paid at least 50% of his or her normal wage while on leave. The credit rate is increased by 0.25% for each percentage point that the wage rate paid while on leave exceeds 50% of the normal rate. However, the maximum credit rate is 25%. Finally, to be eligible for the credit, the employer must give all qualifying full-time employees at least two weeks of annual paid family and medical leave. Part-time employees must be given proportional leave time.

NEW YORK (Project Syndicate) — It's old news that large segments of society have become deeply unhappy with what they see as the establishment, especially the political class.

The cost of health care rises every year, and there's no indication that will stop anytime soon. What's even more harrowing, a lot of that happens in retirement — an American couple retiring last year could expect to spend $275,000 in health care through retirement, up 6% since 2016, according to Fidelity. Not only is it expensive, but it is confusing — most Americans don't understand all the plans and insurance policies available, and tend to shut down before trying to comprehend it. To avoid going broke in retirement cause of health care, experts suggest saving for it specifically (such as through an HSA), paying as you go and adopting a healthy lifestyle — the sooner the better.

• You can take federal-income-tax-free Roth withdrawals after reaching age 59½ as long as you've had at least one Roth account open for more than five years. If you die, your heirs can dip into an inherited Roth account without owing any federal income tax, as long as the account has been open for more than five years. So open a Roth account now to start the five-year clock ticking. If federal income tax rates go up in the future (a distinct possibility especially for high-income folks--despite Trump's proposed tax plan), funds in your Roth IRA will be blissfully unaffected. Think of your Roth IRA as insurance against future tax rate increases, which are still quite possible over the long haul despite the Trump effect.

Moreover, a climb in yields has implications for stocks that have run-up over the past several months amid hope that Trump will make good on his promises. Higher yields can make the perceived safety of U.S. government bonds more attractive to buyers of comparatively risky stocks.

Or might you want to consider holding an amount equal to your specific deductible in a separate account, above and beyond what you're saving for retirement?
With a new year comes new worries. So what are investors most worried about for 2018?
Ocasio-Cortez's tax proposal is aimed at the super-rich, but when it comes to taxes, the super-rich are different from you and me, as F. Scott Fitzgerald may or may not have said. (And as MarketWatch reporter Brett Arends pointed out this week, they may also share many of the same qualities.)

Patients could even save money on their medications by asking doctors and pharmacists about less-expensive versions. Many Americans assume medical expenses at set at a fixed price, but they're not, and patients can comparison shop to reduce costs. Patients can lose thousands of dollars a year by not looking around before going with a medical procedure or prescription, researchers at Harvard, Yale and Columbia Universities found. Fewer than 1% of individuals used price transparency tools, including websites or apps, to find the best prices for medical procedures and medications.
Those were the thoughts of JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, who offered a forecast for U.S. economic growth that outstrips even some of the more bullish economists.
19. Make more money. Saving and/or cutting back is a great way to get ahead, but it's an incomplete strategy if you're not trying to earn more by enhancing your career. Too many people are stuck in the mindset that there's nothing they can do to get a better job, take on more responsibilities or earn a higher salary. That's nonsense.
5. But credit itself is important. Likely the biggest expense over your lifetime will be interest costs on your mortgage, car loans, student loans, etc. Having a solid credit score can save you tens of thousands of dollars by lowering your borrowing costs. So use credit cards, but always pay off the balance each month.
Chinese companies had said corn subsidies in the U.S. were indirectly benefiting U.S. suppliers of DDGS, allowing them to flood the Chinese market. DDGS is a corn-based byproduct from the ethanol industry used by animal breeders as a substitute for corn and soymeal.
Andrew Adams, analyst at Raymond James, also noted that while the S&P 500, which is weighted by market capitalization, notched a record, the same index didn't follow suit when all its components are given an equal rating (see chart below). Also, small-cap stocks, which led the postelection charge, have lost some of their fizz.
China, where the virus was first discovered late last year, has had 96,882 confirmed cases and 4,792 deaths, according to its official numbers.
DAVOS, Switzerland--Google said late Friday that it has struck a deal with the U.K.'s tax authority that will settle a tax dispute and boost its future taxes in Britain, part of a broader effort by European governments to wring more corporate tax from big firms in the tech sector.
The U.S. dollar carved out a three-month low, deepening its losses during Wednesday's trading session after the Federal Reserve's December meeting minutes showed a dovish tilt in the central bank.
U.S. Steel Corp. X, +8.12% shares fell in the extended session Tuesday after the steel producer missed Wall Street estimates for the quarter. U.S. Steel shares dropped 10% to $7. The company reported an fourth-quarter loss of $6.83 a share on revenue of $2.57 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast a loss of 88 cents a share on revenue of $2.53 billion. Of U.S. Steel's $999 million loss on the quarter, $606 million of that was the result of a tax provision, the company said.
The payday lending industry's trade group, the Community Financial Services Association of America, didn't respond to requests for comment. Lenders World Acceptance Corp. WRLD, +1.06% and Enova International Inc. ENVA, -8.25% also didn't respond to requests for comment.

The appeal of Montana last year may be a little less surprising. The Big Sky State is part of the so-called American Redoubt — the thinly populated region that has long been popular among preppers and survivalists. If ever there was a year when preppers and survivalists had the news flow all their own way, it was 2020.
It isn't surprising to me that we're tightening up at the short-end but the fact that monetary policy both here and abroad has been pushing down on the long rate means that this is going to be a little bit different exit strategy than what we've historically seen. We haven't had a bloated balance sheet around the world in previous periods. People who are taking a lot of meaning from the slope of the yield curve, I think, need to consider what it means to be in a different monetary policy framework — which is that Europe, Japan and the United States have a balance sheet that intentionally was suppressing long rates. So the signal value probably isn't quite the same, but it is a reason to your earlier question about why financial conditions haven't tightened more because the balance sheets are likely to only come down gradually over time. Now you could do it differently, and if you want to see the long end of the market go up quickly I can certainly imagine policies of central banks in some part of the world deciding to sell long-term securities would have the impact of pushing up the yield curve. I'm not advocating that. But I think it is an intentional policy. It is not as if this is an unanticipated outcome.
Democrats are looking to be in pole position in Washington after key runoff Senate races in Georgia are tilting away from Republicans, with results already rippling through financial markets. See full story.
Looking ahead, the CPI will be driven higher or lower by a few large categories of spending: shelter, food, energy and medical care combined account for 68% of the CPI. Those are the items to keep your eye on.
Wells Fargo, meanwhile, reported EPS of $1.16, compared with 96 cents a year ago, with revenue of $22 billion. Expectations were for per-share earnings of $1.23 and revenue of $22.45 billion.
Past years when stocks have gotten off to such a strong start have typically coincided with steep gains for the market overall. However, kicking January off with a rally hardly guarantees a smooth ride upward, and there may be no more dramatic illustration of this than 1987. While that year started with big gains, it was also the year of Black Monday, the Oct. 19 crash where 23% of market value was wiped out in a single session. However, the S&P still ended up 2% on the year in 1987.
These are long-term goals and time is on your side for all of them, said Douglas Boneparth, a financial adviser and president of advisory firm Bone Fide Wealth in New York.
Under it, the two chambers of Congress must pass a budget resolution with specific instructions to committees on how much in spending cuts or increases to target or how much in tax increases or cuts to target. Other legislation can be written to raise the federal debt limit.
These top-ranked index funds aren't built to handle a stock-market crash
What's more, in 52% of markets, including Chicago and Los Angeles, rents are rising faster than wages. And more renters may also find themselves priced out of the housing market, because home prices are appreciating more quickly than rents in 70% of markets. As a result, the old guideline of not spending more than 30% of your income on rent (or a mortgage) has become increasingly difficult to follow in cities like San Francisco and New York.
It's not whether she'll blow up, it's how and when, was one Democratic take on the headline-generating congresswoman from New York, Murphy writes.

If you're like most people investing for and living in retirement, you probably want to make sure that you have your financial house in order sooner rather than later in the new year. But what's the best to do that? What tactics and strategies should you consider? Here's what experts had to say.
Grant said that, for serious money, your core money, [a better strategy is] to make sure that whatever the market does, you have money coming in.
Shares of Boeing Co. BA, +0.14% fell in Thursday's extended session after the aircraft maker said it would cut back production on 747s to 0.5 plane per month by September from one currently. Global air passenger traffic growth and airplane demand remain strong, but the air cargo market recovery that began in late 2013 has stalled in recent months and slowed demand for the 747-8 Freighter, said Ray Conner, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. As a result, the company will report a $569 million after-tax charge in the fourth quarter. Boeing shares were off 1.5% in after-hours trading.
With Democrats newly in the Majority in the Senate and the inauguration of the new Biden-Harris Administration just two weeks away, all options are on the table as we consider the best way to address the crises at hand and lead our nation forward, said House Budget Chairman John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat, in a statement.
As we stated yesterday, the chances of the Democrat's taking control of the Senate in a tied majority scenario have risen, wrote Peter Cardillo, chief market strategist at Spartan Capital Securities. However, while we expect the GOP to maintain control by slim margin the political uncertainties will likely keep the market defensive, he wrote.
That creates a lot of volatility in oil-field investment. High prices attract a lot of investment, but when prices fall, as they did in 2014 and 2015, investment collapses. The dip in U.S. growth rates in 2015 and 2016 was largely due to the impact of lower oil prices on business investment.
While it came in below expectations, it wasn't sufficiently weak for investors to feel they should sell. Single months of data can be lumpy, but the average over the past few months shows that the labor market remains strong.

The question everyone is asking is: Are the gut-wrenching ups and downs in the U.S. stock market just noise? Or is the flirtation with a bear market an early warning sign of what the U.S. economy can expect in 2019?
The partial government shutdown is now setting records, and investors might not be able to ignore it for much longer, analysts said.

This, of course, isn't the first time Trump has claimed responsibility for job creation without providing details on what those jobs are or offering transparency as to where they're coming from.

The float, which would be one of the first big IPOs of the year, would come more than seven years after the Griggs family sold Dr. Martens for £300 million to Permira. The private equity group plans to sell down its stake as part of the IPO.
The history of white power extremism dates back to slave patrols and the post-Civil War rise of the KKK. In the 1920s, the KKK had millions of members. The following decade saw the rise of Nazi sympathizers, including 15,000 uniformed Silver Shirts and a 20,000-person pro-Nazi rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City in 1939.
Technology shares were the most represented sector in the basket, comprising 22% of the holdings. Alliance Data Systems ADS, -2.67% and F5 Networks Inc. FFIV, -0.54% were among the biggest tech components; both pay a tax rate around 37%.

The number of people in this bracket is likely very small — less than 2% of American households, according to 2013 Internal Revenue Service data. In total, about 20% of all American households would see their taxes rise under Trump's plan, according to the Tax Policy Center.
• England's chief medical officer, Prof. Chris Whitty, said the country was facing a major health emergency unless people strictly abide by the lockdown rules set by the government, with the National Health Service threatening to be overwhelmed by the number of COVID patients, MarketWatch's Pierre Briançon reported. More than 81,000 people have died from the coronavirus disease in the U.K., the world's fifth-highest toll. That is twice as much as more populous Germany. The government on Monday opened seven mass vaccination centers, with up to 50 such facilities planned, as it tries to reach 15 million of the country's most vulnerable by mid February.
The U.S. has reached the point where cash could be replaced almost completely with a system of electronic debits and credits. Yet the amount of dollar bills being used continues to grow, particularly bills of large denominations. There are now almost 12 billion $100 bills in circulation, up from 2 billion 20 years ago. Divided by the size of the U.S. population, those 12 billion $100 bills amount to 48 Benjamins for every American man, woman, and child.
Insure against catastrophe. Health insurance can prevent bankrupting medical bills. Disability insurance can replace your income if you can't work. Life insurance protects your dependents. Liability insurance can cover lawsuits that might otherwise wipe you out. As you accumulate wealth, make sure you increase the liability limits on your home and auto insurance to at least equal your net worth.
We are skeptical of meaningful re-acceleration in industrywide loan growth, said UBS analysts in a Jan. 4 note. They forecast lending growth of 5.9% for Citigroup and 0.1% for Bank of America Corp. BAC, +2.61% , which report Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. That will be driven by commercial real estate, Juneja noted. In contrast, buoyant consumers and a blowout Christmas shopping season are boosting credit card loans—though other consumer loan types, like autos, are growing more slowly.
The White House's estimates also don't allow for any negative impact through business and consumer confidence in general, which is another source of downside risk, noted Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. However, there is so far little evidence that market sentiment has suffered so far, he said, in a note.

But some have been going the other way. Credit Suisse's U.S. equity strategist Jonathan Golub lifted his S&P 500 SPX, +0.29% year-end target to 4,200, from 4,050, partly on hopes for a stronger economic reopening as Democrats gain power in Washington.
Unlike with a traditional IRA, you don't have to start taking annual required minimum distributions (RMDs) from Roth accounts after reaching age 70½. Instead, you can leave your Roth account(s) untouched for as long as you live if you wish. This important privilege makes your Roth IRA a great asset to leave to your heirs (to the extent you don't need the Roth money to help finance your own retirement).
Now let's figure out the annuity payout, which amounts to 30 average annual payments of $50 million, pre-tax. After the federal tax withholdings, that's an average of $37.5 million per year, according to USAMega.com. A 5% state tax would reduce it to an average of $35 million.
A personal defined-benefit plan provides a guaranteed payout in your retirement years, just like the defined-benefit plans of old. The yearly payout can be no larger than the average of your three highest-earning years, up to a maximum of $215,000. The amount you invest in your plan—which must be substantial to provide such a large guaranteed payout—is tax deductible.
Of course, there's also the possibility that a building consensus for an inauguration day top turns out to be a contrarian indicator of its own.
Tesla bull Dan Ives at Wedbush Securities said he was surprised that there wasn't a significant pull forward in deliveries, even though potential buyers knew that a EV tax credit was coming. While Tesla's price cuts could help soften the blow of the tax credit cut, it's not what the bulls wanted to hear given the impact on profitability.
Parents can also set up trusts for their children, though they should work with an attorney to draft the documents instead of attempting to do it themselves, said Kevin Couper, a financial adviser at Sontag Advisory in New York. Trusts, which are not always tax advantageous and are also subject to gift limitations, can incorporate any rules by the parents, such as what age the children gain control of the account and how frequently the money is distributed to the child. There is a lot of flexibility, he said. You wouldn't necessarily choose this option for a short-term goal, Boneparth said, but it would make sense for a considerable sum of money.
Get ready for the looming digital meltdown.
At the same time, the risks associated with investing in bitcoin—namely the potential for theft—have been substantially diminished over the past three years, with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency authorizing national banks to provide cryptocurrency services. Several banks have also started to provide institutional bitcoin custody services, deposit-taking, custody and fiduciary services for digital assets.

The dollar rally is being driven by enormous investor expectations that the relatively strong U.S. economy will accelerate even further under the leadership of [President-elect] Donald Trump who is expected to stoke growth through fiscal stimulus and deregulation, said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management. The dollar has risen 4.6% over the last quarter on prospects of rising inflation and interest rates.
Still, Americans don't seem to be giving up on homeownership yet. Sales of existing homes rose 14.7% in December, the biggest monthly increase ever recorded, after depressed sales in November. Sales in 2015 were the best since 2006, at 5.26 million.

Landis also took issue with those who argue that, far from the Social Security system running out of money in 2034, it is broke now. Those who make that argument point out that the much-vaunted Social Security trust fund of nearly $3 trillion doesn't really exist—the money was deposited with the U.S. Treasury where it was long ago spent.
New York Fed President William Dudley on Tuesday said he's wary of the border-adjustment provision contained in the House Republican tax plan.
There are many costly products (see #9 below) to avoid: i. Variable annuities which possess deferred contingent sales charges; ii.Equity indexed annuities marketed as alternatives to stock market investing, or any that possess a deferred contingent sales charge; iii.Non-publicly traded REITs; iv.Hedge funds; v.Proprietary mutual funds (mutual funds manufactured by an affiliate of your brokerage firm); vi.Principal trades (such as when a brokerage firm sells you a bond out of their inventory); vii.IPOs (on average, the performance of stocks in IPOs underperforms the rest of the market over the two years following the IPO (initial public offering)—there will always be some big winners, but the losers (underperformers) dominate in this space; viii.Any cash value life insurance product sold for retirement needs.

When reducing the number of brackets, you don't want to have too much of a tax cut, but you also want to try to approximate something like the original curve, Cole said. The result of that means sometimes if you're not super generous all the way across, you're going to end up with a tax increase for some. It's a little causality of simplification.
A mob stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, but investors showed little reaction — lifting the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a record close and showing little appetite for traditional safe-haven assets despite violent scenes that temporarily interrupted the ratification of President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College victory.
Ocasio-Cortez's mention in early January of a 70% tax on the wealthy provoked heated reaction from both supporters and detractors, with House Republican whip Steve Scalise deriding the idea as a leftist fantasy program.
Others, who at times identify themselves with the term alt-right, often mix racism, anti-Semitism and claims of white victimization in a less militant way. In addition, there are what some experts have called the alt-lite, like the Proud Boys, who are less violent and disavow overt white supremacy even as they promote white power by glorifying white civilization and demonizing nonwhite people including Muslims and many immigrants.
There are three broad classes of fixed investment: structures, such as factories, oil wells and housing; equipment, such as machinery, airplanes and computers; and intellectual property, such as software, new drugs, and blockbuster Hollywood movies.
The current policies by the Federal Reserve also stifle retirement plans for the younger generation. Current approaches cause low or nonexistent income for most savers, and there is no indication of it getting better for the foreseeable future. Decades ago, with Social Security and a pension from an employer, a person could expect to sustain themselves in retirement. Now, too many people find themselves retiring with student loans, car loans, and more that make retirement difficult to realize.
Musk said the company will retain only the most critical temps and contractors, adding that the staffing changes will be made while boosting Model 3 production and making many manufacturing engineering improvements in the coming months.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said Tesla TSLA, -4.39% faces a tough challenge of making our cars, batteries and solar products cost-competitive with fossil fuels, and that the company's products are still too expensive for most people, according to an update on the company's blog that was emailed to all employees.
Gymboree has reportedly filed for bankruptcy — the second time in two years.
While these probable victories raise the level of political uncertainty and certain sectors of the U.S. equity market may underperform (health care, tech for example), the macro implications of these election outcomes are clearly positive, said Derek Halpenny, head of research for global markets at MUFG Bank in London. There is now a chance of larger stimulus checks for U.S. households ($2,000 instead of $600) and an increased prospect of larger fiscal stimulus support in general going forward.
Investors pushed yields higher on the expectation that Trump's proposed policies—including stiffer trade barriers, a massive infrastructure bill and deregulation—would boost growth and wages, causing consumer-price inflation to rise more aggressively.
So far, the beat rate has slightly below historical averages. Butters said this week that 70% of companies reporting results have beat earnings expectations, just below the five-year average beat rate of 71%.
Furloughed workers are scrambling to delay their bills, and some lenders are offering assistance with zero-interest loans or reversed overdraft fees. Bills, of course, are not disappearing — unpaid federal workers owe more than $400 million in mortgage and rent payments, and are also on the hook for auto loans, credit-card debt, student loans and everyday expenses.
Nothing proves that quite like research on millionaires by wealth management firm UBS. UBS, +1.71% Sixty percent of those with more than $5 million defined themselves as wealthy, compared with 28% of those worth $1 million to $5 million. Yet what millionaires mean by wealthy is not necessarily financial independence: Only 10% defined wealthy as not having to work. It's not even a number; only 16% said surpassing a certain asset threshold automatically made you rich.

The new leader could inform European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker and all the other oligarchs of Europe's ruling class that on March 29 — the date the U.K. is scheduled to leave — his government will declare unilateral free trade with Europe. It would continue to permit EU banks and professionals to do business and work in the UK if the EU does the same.
Back to Bogle, who haunts our call of the day from Andrew Lapthorne on Société GLE, -0.94% quantitative analysis team. The analyst warns that U.S. small-caps will be in the eye of the next storm for stocks, owing to the huge amount of debt they've been racking up for years. Corporate debt was another horizontal cloud mentioned by the Bogle.
Over time, you keep building that cushion while insuring yourself against catastrophic expenses that could wipe out what you've saved. Eventually, you can achieve financial independence, where your income in retirement is sufficient to cover your expenses and some extras.
This reading implies a significant level of potential longer-term risk, he says. If the market does start to head meaningfully lower, this condition could exacerbate the decline, given the amount of capital with the potential to exit the market. In such an event, the substantial potential risk could, thus, become manifested risk.
The film, which stars Michelle Williams as Getty's impoverished daughter-in-law Gail, and Mark Wahlberg as his security investigator Fletcher Chase, explores the chasm between Getty's colossal fortune and his family troubles, which culminated in Italian captors kidnapping his grandson John Paul Getty III in 1973 and cutting off his right ear before Getty paid the $3 million ransom. Getty himself shelled out $2.2 million, the maximum that was tax deductible, and lent his drug-addled son John Paul Getty Jr. the remaining $800,000 at 4% interest.
Identifying a common enemy can also help, the authors added, noting the obvious threat of the virus. Since some people in a polarized U.S. still don't see the COVID-19 as a legitimate concern, public-health officials for now could focus on downstream effects of the virus: We can focus on 'battling' poverty by getting people back to work or on 'racing' other countries to return to normal, they wrote.

But it is not just Trump's proposed tax changes that plausibly affect market psychology. The U.S. has never had a president like him. Not only is he an actor, like Ronald Reagan; he is also a motivational writer and speaker, a brand name in real estate, and a tough deal maker. If he ever reveals his financial information, or if his family is able to use his influence as president to improve its bottom line, he might even prove to be successful in business.
Fed policy makers raised their median forecast for the number of rate increases in 2017 to three in December, up from two previously. But minutes from the central bank's December meeting revealed that many officials are still cautious.
My husband and I currently have a $70,000 mortgage on rental properties and a $20,000 balance on a 0% annual percentage rate credit card that covered the remaining balance on our house in Costa Rica, which we mostly paid cash for and expect to pay off by February.

There are lessons from the rapid acceptance of the internet when considering legislating the cryptocurrencies. The permission-less innovation with respect to the internet was one of the keys to its success. Imagine how much progress would have been delayed — or crippled — if web developers had been forced to acquire a license to set up each new site.

The incentives in the 2017 tax cut had almost nothing to do with the investment boom we saw in 2017 and 2018, which helps explain why many corporate executives and macro-economists don't think the tax cut transformed the economy at all.
Well, in the old days, before the HSA, the advice was this: Save using a traditional 401(k) if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement or save using a Roth 401(k) if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

What has been viewed as muted moves in Treasury yields come as the dollar, as gauged by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.13% , has been near its lows for September at 92.07, despite tax-cut legislation and other fiscal stimulus measures which were expected to boost the buck. The dollar regained some ground on Wednesday, extending gains in the wake of the minutes.
If you're an entrepreneur, having a great business credit score can really help you. You'll have easier access to a business loan or line of credit. A high business credit score also helps you receive lower rates on loans and insurance. This leads to more savings for your company.
Further, Ackman's comments about U.S. stocks and index funds are a fallacy of composition. After all, the rise of index funds is a global phenomenon and many global markets (like emerging markets) have become quite attractive in relative value terms over the past 10 years when compared with U.S. stocks. Savvy managers should be able to exploit the attractive valuations in parts of the world where valuations have declined substantially, but despite the supposed upward pressure from indexing, many of these foreign markets have appeared more like value traps than anything else.

An excellent example of this bit of Munger wisdom in action was during the height of the bull market bubble in technology stocks during the late 1990s, when many brilliant investors were busy buying the hot internet stocks of the day. Munger knew he didn't understand these new internet businesses — so he and Berkshire Hathaway avoided them completely. Most of Wall Street thought he had lost his touch. But when the internet stock bubble finally burst, and many fortunes were lost, and it was Munger who looked brilliant.

When oil prices began to tumble in the summer of 2014, natural gas partnership prices declined as well, even though their revenues were derived from long-term contracts to transport natural gas. Investors panicked out of fear that depressed energy prices would make future pipeline contracts less lucrative. But low natural gas prices are leading to continued production increases as the U.S. ramps up exports of liquid natural gas. This means more good times ahead for the toll-taking gas pipeline operators.

But add to the Trump effect all the attention paid to Dow 20,000, and we have the makings of a powerful illusion. On Nov. 10, 2016, two days after Donald J. Trump was elected, the Dow Jones average hit a new record high, and has since set 16 more daily records, all trumpeted by news media.
Trust arrangements can help protect your assets and ensure accountability in how funds are distributed.

Thursday's reports throws some cold water on the bullish crowd.
The new tax law has further complicated the math in deciding whether to rent or buy, according to the Urban Institute. Under the 2017 tax code, a family of three with an annual income of $150,000 would be better off buying if their rent exceeded $1,507 per month. But with the new tax code, they'd have to pay more than $1,885 per month to make buying worthwhile. Do we expect people not to buy because of these changes? At the margin, yes, researchers at the Urban Institute wrote.
Actively managed U.S. stock funds' performance in 2015 mostly disproved the idea that stock pickers can beat the market when the market is beat.

Beyond conventional payday lenders, some credit unions that serve government employees are offering loans to affected workers during the shutdown, and they're not necessarily charging the high interest that's usually associated with cash advances. The Navy Federal Credit Union, for example, is offering to lend up to $6,000 to eligible members, saying there will be no fees or interest charges, while the Congressional Federal Credit Union will extend a line of credit with a 0% interest rate for 60 days.
And so, in God's mercy, a happy Christmas to you all.
Economists at Barclays point out this claims report has special significance because it was conducted in the same week that the government does its measurement for the nonfarm payrolls report. The Barclays economists note that continuing claims were higher than during the survey week for December; however, almost half the rise comes from California, impacted by a rise in agricultural claims, which don't, by definition, make it into the nonfarm payrolls report. The remainder of the claims rise, relative to December, is concentrated in states like Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, where the manufacturing industry's troubles are impacting.
Firstly, good work. Now here's where else you can save.
There's no time like a new year to establish new habits. Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the nonprofit Identity Theft Resource Center, recommends relying on tools you already use — phone alarms, calendars, journals or refrigerator notes — to remind you to add cards when needed and remove them afterward. For example, add a note saying take insurance and prescription cards to the reminder about your doctor appointment. Set a reminder to remove them, too.
Liz Keller, director of the Delaware Tourism Office, says many retirees come from the big nearby states, and retire to Delaware because they already have a second home there.

Ghosting them without a decision will only prolong your stress—make sure you give them a decision when promised.
Converting a traditional IRA with a relatively big balance could push you into a higher tax bracket. For example, if you're single and expect your 2019 taxable income to be about $110,000, your marginal federal income tax rate is 24%. Converting a $100,000 traditional IRA into a Roth account in 2019 would cause about half of the extra income from the conversion to be taxed at 32%. But if you spread the $100,000 conversion 50/50 over 2019 and 2020 (which you are allowed to do), all the extra income from converting would be probably taxed at 24%.
Schumer reiterated that idea Wednesday in a brief news conference on Capitol Hill.

These events give you the opportunity to meet like-minded people and receive recognition for your generosity.

• Quite possibly, you do have enough assets to be exposed to estate taxes, but you don't know it. Consider this: for tax purposes, your estate includes your house, furnishings, cars, retirement plan assets, investments, equity in employer stock options, baseball card collection, and everything else you own. Here's the kicker: it also includes any proceeds from insurance on your own life unless you take steps to prevent this (such as setting up an irrevocable life insurance trust). In my experience, it is usually life insurance that causes unexpected estate tax exposure. Right now, the value of your estate must exceed $5.49 million (or $10.98 million if you are married) for you to be exposed to the federal estate tax, and that's before any estate tax relief that might be enacted by the Republicans.

Portland State University's Institute on Aging studied 650 adults over a two-year period and discovered prolonged conflict was significantly associated with a high number of negative health conditions, as stress dampens the immune system. When we're saying yes to requests that we'd much rather avoid, it pushes our beliefs and behaviors out of harmony. This kind of cognitive dissonance causes horrible discomfort and irritability—a vicious circle that results in depression, anxiety, even Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, according to The British Journal of Psychiatry.
The exact amount of this larger maximum is dependent on a number of assumptions, such as your age when you set up the plan, your income history, your life expectancy, and what actuarial assumptions are used to project stock and bond returns into the future. Charles Schwab, which can help clients set up these plans and then oversee and administer them, illustrated what this maximum would be by focusing on a hypothetical 55-year old in 2016 who intended to retire when he is 65, and whose income for the prior three years averaged $260,000 a year. The firm calculated that this hypothetical physician would have been able to contribute as much as $165,800 in pretax dollars into a personal defined-benefit plan.

A new report released by Arcview Market Research on Tuesday says the legal marijuana industry is expected to generate nearly $40 billion in economic impact by 2021. That would be roughly a 150% increase in economic output from the $16 billion cannabis generated in 2017. The report provides estimates on cannabis's total economic contribution, direct and indirect jobs created and tax receipts from each of the 35 states that are expected to have medical and, or recreational marijuana by 2021, according to a news release. Across the country, Americans are worried about being able to find jobs and support their families, Arcview Market Research Editor-in-Chief Tom Adams said in a statement. The numerous employment opportunities created by the cannabis industry, especially in states that are legalizing adult use, cross the spectrum from retail and service jobs to science, technology and other traditional professions. The report estimates that legalization of adult-use, or recreational marijuana sales in California, which began on Tuesday, will create nearly 146,000 cannabis-related jobs in the state in four years. As California joined some 28 other states, and the District of Columbia, that have legalized recreational marijuana stocks of companies tied to the industry saw big share gains on Tuesday.
Earlier, Goldman posted its first quarterly loss in six years as a weak performance by its trading unit added to a one-time charge related to the new tax law. The bank said it had a $1.93 billion loss, or a loss of $5.51 a share, in the quarter, weighed down by a $4.4 billion tax charge.

Upper-income individuals would face higher capital gains taxes under the Biden plan. Under current law, the maximum effective federal income tax rate on net long-term capital gains and qualified dividends recognized by individual taxpayers is 23.8%, as explained in the main body of this column. Under the Biden plan, net long-term gains (and presumably dividends) collected by those with incomes above $1 million would be taxed at the same 39.6% maximum rate that is proposed for ordinary income and net short-term capital gains. With the 3.8% NIIT add-on, the maximum effective rate on net long-term gains would 43.4% (39.6% plus 3.8%). That would be almost double the current maximum effective rate of only 23.8%.

We credit our aha moment to Michael Saylor, the chief executive of software company MicroStrategy, who bought $1.2 billion of bitcoin in 2020. During a recent SALT Talk, Saylor made a persuasive case that bitcoin, as the undisputed winner of the cryptocurrency wars of 2017, is the dominant digital monetary network. Like Saylor, we believe that when a digital network—think Facebook, Amazon and Google—achieves a market capitalization of over $100 billion, the horse is out of the barn.

Still trillions more dollars are needed but the federal deficit is already too big and someone has to pay. Many members of Congress reflexively balk at higher gas taxes and user-fees solutions but Leaders Pelosi and Chuck Schumer could triangulate the issue with Trump.
The latest story about the inevitable day of reckoning due to index funds comes from hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. Ackman's flagship hedge fund has failed to outperform the benchmark S&P 500 Index by a wide margin in the past few years, and his 2015 annual letter blamed index funds for some of the troubles. How much of this is true, though? Let's explore some of Ackman's comments in more detail.

One of the risk factors mentioned in the prospectus is the company's liability for obligations of the Brink's Co., thanks to its acquisition of a business formerly owned by Brink's called Broadview Security. That business is subject to the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992, meaning it must cover the costs of health-care coverage for retired workers suffering from coal-related ailments.
A household's average tax rate — also called their effective tax rate — is the total share of their income that they pay in taxes. It's usually much lower than their top marginal rate, as this chart from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows.
Free trade always has victims, but the EEC delivered dynamic growth from the consolidation of businesses across national boundaries.

American Airlines Group Inc.'s stock AAL, +2.52% surged 2.3% in premarket trade Friday, after the air carrier reported a fourth-quarter profit that rose above expectations. Earnings rose to $3.28 billion, or $5.09 a share, from $597 million, or 82 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, such as a benefit related to the reversal of a tax valuation allowance, adjusted earnings per share came to $2, above the FactSet consensus of $1.97. Revenue fell to $9.63 billion from $10.16 billion, compared with the FactSet consensus of $9.64 billion. Passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) fell 6% to 12.69 cents. Operating expenses declined 7.9%, due primarily to a 41% drop in fuel expenses. The stock has tumbled 17% over the past three months through Thursday, while the S&P 500 has lost 9.4%.
The program would include licensing opportunities and assistance for communities of color who have suffered disproportionately during the U.S.'s yearslong War on Drugs.

The Los Gatos, Calif. company, however, has maintained its view on competition, welcoming new entrants to the internet streaming landscape and saying there is plenty of consumer time for multiple companies to be successful.
The U.S. vaccination program continued to stumble also. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine tracker shows that as of 9.00 a.m. ET on Thursday, just 5.9 million Americans had been vaccinated, way below the 20 million that was the most recent revision to targets promised by the federal government. Just 21.4 million doses had been distributed. In December, when the first emergency use authorizations were granted to the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.11% and German partner BioNTech SE BNTX, -1.33% and later by Moderna Inc., the government initially promised 100 million doses would be delivered by year-end.

Indexing strategies have been the fastest-growing segment of the asset-management industry in the past 15 years because of low fees, tax efficiency, diversification and the failure of high-fee active fund managers to justify those higher fees.
So how do we learn to say NO with grace?
Renting is significantly more expensive than buying in the City of Brotherly Love. In fact, the average wage-earner would need a 36% raise to afford the average rent there. Buying, however, is more affordable.
Yahoo US:YHOO responded by saying it's in the midst of a multiyear transformation and will share additional plans for change on or before its fourth-quarter earnings call.
The energy giant said it expects to book a $1.7 billion charge in its 2017 fourth-quarter results for claims related to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The company has already said it is likely to take a $1.5 billion accounting charge related to U.S. tax reform. BP shares have a weighting of 5.1% on the FTSE 100, the fourth-highest of any individual company, according to FactSet data.
6. On the regulatory front, the U.S. Department of Labor is close to finalizing regulations that will require all those providing advice to 401(k), certain other ERISA-covered retirement plan accounts, and all forms of IRAs, to do so under the fiduciary standard. But, the implementation date is likely to be at the end of 2016, not before. And the regulations won't apply to other types of accounts (such as individual non-IRA accounts, joint accounts, and trust accounts). Hence, investors need to protect themselves:
If a report is frozen, the agencies cannot release information to lenders or others who request to screen credit unless the individual lifts the lock. Assad Lazarus, senior vice president of product and consumer experience at Equifax, says a credit freeze is the most proactive solution because it blocks the possibility that a swindler could misuse the child's credit.
1. Save some of your money regularly instead of spending everything. Start your serious savings earlier instead of later. If you can't sock away a lot, don't let that stop you. If you can save (and invest) even $25 a week, that's still $1,300 in a year, $13,000 in 10 years. Do that for 30 years and earn a compound return of 10%, and you'll have about $214,000. (And once you start seeing the results, I'm willing to bet you'll find ways to add more than just $25 a week.)
This option would keep the U.K. in Europe's single market, or single economic zone, without being a full member. That is an attractive prospect to U.S. businesses in London. It is also quite likely to win widespread support in parliament and in the EU.
All things considered, buying property represents one of the most effective ways to build wealth but also one of the slowest. Though, once your investments start to compound, your portfolio will begin to have several income generating assets. You can reinvest the profits you make from selling previous investments and see your wealth truly begin to snowball.
Presidents in constitutional democracy don't have absolute powers: in the American system, they operate within a system of checks and balances. But some observers say it's an exaggeration to see Trump's threat to declare a phony national emergency as a dangerous power grab. In Politico, the headline for an opinion article written by Zachary Karabell urges people to stop freaking out about Trump's state of emergency threats. Karabell acknowledges that [d]eclaring a national emergency to solve an invented crisis might be misguided…[but] it [would not be] an existential threat. Karabell notes that other presidents have taken broader or more dangerous actions during past emergencies — Franklin Roosevelt during World War II; Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War — and American democracy survived. On Lawfare, the headline for a piece written by Quinta Jurecic urges everyone [to] calm down about the prospect of Trump declaring a contrived emergency. Jurecic agrees that it would be stupid for Trump to do this, but asserts that it would not, in itself, be a step toward authoritarianism.
It starts with valuing the importance of what saying no means to our daily lives. Whether we are retired or still part of the workforce, we need to acknowledge that our time is precious currency that should be spent with great care. We want our days to be filled with a variety of familial, civic and work-related responsibilities that we highly honor.

But producing oil from shale is different in an important way: The investments are much smaller (less than $10 million per well), production can ramp up quickly, and the productive life of any well is much shorter. This means the profitability of investing in a shale-fracking project depends on expected oil prices over the next few years.
As far as trading of individual cryptocurrencies goes, there are a number of topics that must first be addressed, he said:
But U.S. data released Tuesday morning revealed that the ISM manufacturing index climbed to 60.7% in December, from 57.5%, to reach its highest level since August 2018, dulling appetite for gold and prompting some losses in earlier dealings.

Goldman Sachs Group was the darling of the Dow on Wednesday, after its stock surged nearly 10%, marking its best day in about a decade.
Still, those rising yields might be manageable if it means that U.S. economic growth is humming along. And elevated rates are a boon for banks which borrow on a short-term basis and lend long-term. Gross thinks the growth trajectory remains unclear and that gross domestic product needs to touch an annual rate of 3% to help to boost corporate profits rather than the 2% rate GDP has hovered around over the past decade.

J.P. Morgan reported per-share earnings of $1.07, versus $1.71 a year ago, but beat the FactSet consensus of $1.69. Revenue of $25.45 billion was 5% higher than the $24.33 billion booked a year ago and beat the FactSet consensus of $25.17 billion.
Friday's rally meant that none of the equity indexes have posted a down day so far in 2018. For the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, it was the fourth straight closing record, while the Dow carved out its third in a row. The broad-market benchmark has closed at a record on the first four trading days of the new year, the first time it has done so since 1964, according to WSJ Market Data Group.
But a footnote in investment bank's quarterly report indicates that more than one-fifth of the firm's EPS performance in the last three months of the year can be attributed to a $467 million tax benefit bank received after overpaying repatriation taxes, which were due as a result of the 2017 corporate tax reform. Goldman had expected a one-time charge of $4.4 billion related to the Trump administration's late-2017 corporate tax cuts, but the final tax benefits were better than the bank's original estimates.

Retire your mortgage. Having a paid-for home by the time you retire won't just help you sleep better at night. It also means you don't have to withdraw as much from your retirement funds, since you're not making mortgage payments. A lower withdrawal rate can make your savings last longer. You also can turn your equity into income if necessary through a reverse mortgage or by downsizing.

Therefore, he will have an outstanding balance of around $300,000, which is about what the remaining estate has in total. Is there any legal way to make him pay the balance, or are we just left to hope his conscience makes him pay? He has done everything by the books on the restitution, but has put all property, business [he owns some franchise restaurants and apartments], cars, etc. in his wife's name to avoid paying more than the minimum restitution. So in this case maybe crime does pay. What are your thoughts?

It took me a while to really get a grip on this bit of Munger wisdom. It is predicated on the theory that a shortsighted stock market will sometimes underprice a company's shares relative to the long-term economic value of the company. When that happens, Munger buys into the company and holds it for the long term, letting the underlying economics of the business eventually lift the stock price.

For purposes of meeting the five-year requirement, the clock starts ticking on the first day of the tax year for which you make your initial contribution to your first Roth account. That initial contribution can be a regular annual contribution, or it can be a conversion contribution. For example, say your initial Roth pay-in was an annual contribution made on April 1, 2017 for your 2016 tax year. The five-year clock started ticking on Jan. 1, 2016 (the beginning of the tax year for which the contribution was made), and you will meet the five-year requirement on Jan. 1, 2021.

Economists are not very good at predicting how large deviations will be. And there are some underlying reasons for why you might see valuation differences. One would be that if you really think we're in a low-interest-rate environment. That means valuations, will, on average, be higher. So the question is, do you think that is a permanent phenomenon or a temporary phenomenon? And obviously when you are talking about stocks, but also to some extent commercial real estate, the tax code matters, and we've just had a tax code change. So those kinds of effects can have an impact on valuation. But I would say that real estate, like other asset classes, are now showing to be a bit higher than what they've been historically and that continues to be a little bit of a concern for me.
By law, the insurer must be conservative with the funds so the actual interest is going to be quite modest. The amount of each payment that is nontaxable is based on an exclusion ratio (see IRS Publication 939).
Laws like those in New York, requiring a BitLicense for cryptocurrency activity with a large legal, compliance and filing cost, are a mistake and will only protect incumbents and drive innovation away. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ruling that the cryptocurrencies issued by Initial Coin Offerings are securities and need to be registered will drive these issuances overseas (probably to Japan and Singapore with their supportive regulatory regime) and the U.S. innovators and investors may not be able to participate.

My husband cheated on me, moved out of our home, and moved in with his girlfriend in October 2019. He stopped paying all the bills and doesn't pay child support, or much of anything. He filed for divorce, but because we are unable to finish paying the lawyers, our divorce is on pause.
That almost certainly means those of us who are still working will pay in one way or another. We could fix the problem virtually overnight by raising the Social Security tax rate by 1.415% to 7.615% and increasing the Medicare tax rate by 0.32% to 1.77%.

Interested newcomers must live inside Candela, rent a house and have a job paying a salary of at least 7,500 euros ($8,800) per year to be approved for the generous offer. Singles will receive 800 ($940) euros from the town coffers, couples will get 1,200 euros ($1,400), three-member families will get 1,500 to 1,800 euros ($1,760-$2,100), and families of four to five people will get more than 2,000 euros ($2,350).

Bitcoin is an evolutionary step forward for the technology of money, which has steadily progressed from barter to beads to gold to fiat currency. Bitcoin is the first store of value in the world where supply is entirely unaffected by increased demand. Some 18.5 million bitcoin have been mined so far, and by 2025, over 20 million will be in circulation. Yet there can only ever be 21 million bitcoin because of a stipulation set forth in its source code.

The Internal Revenue Service on Wednesday announced that it is waiving a penalty for any taxpayer who paid at least 85% of their total tax liability during the year through federal income tax withholding, quarterly estimated tax payments or a combination of the two. The usual percentage threshold to avoid a penalty has been 90%, the IRS said in a statement. We realize there were many changes that affected people last year, and this penalty waiver will help taxpayers who inadvertently didn't have enough tax withheld, said IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig.
What's more, the HSA gives savers a way to earmark money for an expenditure that currently represents 10% to 15% of all expenses in retirement. So, instead of using all the money in your 401(k) to fund all your expenses in retirement: housing, health care, food, transportation and so on. You would use your HSA to fund just health-care expenses and your 401(k) to pay for all the other expenses.

Inflation would still be, I think, in a range that it wouldn't be affecting decision-making by households or firms but would give you a little more flexibility to reduce the probability that you hit zero during recessions. So if we were to have a recession right now, most recessions we move interest rates by much more than 300 basis points. If you look at where the [Fed forecasts] in December had the fed funds in the long run, [2.8%] it is low enough that more than likely in most recessions we'd hit zero. That is a concern.
Do an apples-to-apples comparison to at least see if the lump-sum offer is a good one, Haithcock said.

As you know, the usual deadline for filing your annual personal federal income tax return is April 15 of the following year. However, that date is always adjusted for weekends and holidays. So the deadline for your 2016 Form 1040 is April 18, 2017. That date reflects the fact that April 15 and 16 fall on a weekend and April 17 is the Emancipation Day holiday in the District of Columbia. If you can't file by April 18, you can obtain an automatic six-month extension to Oct. 16 by filing Form 4868 by no later than April 18.

• Interest and dividends vs. selling shares? John and Jane could have chosen to have interest and dividends transferred to a bank account first, and then sell shares if needed. For example, if they received $20,000 in interest and dividend payments — equal to 2% yield from their $1 million — they'd only need another $20,000 more from their portfolio. It can be easier, though, just to reinvest and keep the money working. This can also make the paperwork easier.
All of these trades are, fundamentally, driven by the same factor: The expectation that Trump's policies will spur growth and stoke inflationary pressures if his administration slashes corporate taxes, embarks on a massive spending program and rolls back regulation as speculated.

Moderna's vaccine marks the third to be approved for use by the MHRA and the second that uses the mRNA approach, which sends a message to cells telling them to create proteins that can generate an immune response.

This makes life hard for the central bank. For instance, it makes it more difficult for the central bank to engineer a soft landing for the economy, Rosengren said. It also means the Fed cannot pause in its gradual pace of rate hikes and should even pick up the pace a bit this year. The U.S. central bank might have to raise rates four times in 2018, he said, more than the median forecast of Fed officials or the two hikes the market expects.

This is a strange Christmas Eve. Almost the whole world is locked in deadly struggle, and, with the most terrible weapons which science can devise, the nations advance upon each other. Ill would it be for us this Christmastide if we were not sure that no greed for the land or wealth of any other people, no vulgar ambition, no morbid lust for material gain at the expense of others, had led us to the field. Here, in the midst of war, raging and roaring over all the lands and seas, creeping nearer to our hearts and homes, here, amid all the tumult, we have tonight the peace of the spirit in each cottage home and in every generous heart. Therefore we may cast aside for this night at least the cares and dangers which beset us, and make for the children an evening of happiness in a world of storm. Here, then, for one night only, each home throughout the English-speaking world should be a brightly-lighted island of happiness and peace.

If May loses the vote on her EU deal by only a small majority — perhaps fewer than 50 votes — she will likely once again ask Brussels for last-ditch amendments to the deal, with a view to bringing those back to the U.K. Parliament and persuading enough politicians to back her in a second vote.
At the same time, the need for Congress to focus on Social Security is getting more dire, thanks in part to the pandemic. The pandemic has the potential to move the depletion date to as soon as 2024, Arnone said. You don't want to make policy in 2023 knowing the trust funds could be depleted in 2024, he said. Because of the pandemic, some Americans born in 1960 and 1961 will already see less in benefits over their lifetimes, according to an analysis from the Center for American Progress.

Perhaps, he said, the right decision is to delay retirement to allow them to work longer and save more. After being retired for year, if you decide you want to go back to work, it is rare to see someone ever go back to the level of earnings they had in the past, said Watters. Thus, it is a big decision to stop working.

Sticking to a plan is also key to having a comfortable amount of assets when it's time to retire, something Joe Mecca, a 40-year-old marketing manager at Coastal Federal Credit Union in Raleigh, N.C. has done, he said. Even when finances were tight — such as student loans, auto loans and at one point his dual-income household becoming a single-income household — he remained steadfast on contributing to his future's funds, knowing the money would grow to his benefit. He did admit it would have been easier to stop contributions so he could have more cash flow every paycheck, though.

Munger's sitting on your ass investing strategy argues one will make more money buying into a business with exceptional business economics working in its favor and holding it for many years, than engaging in a lot of buying and selling trying to anticipate stock market moves.

Many 50-somethings are at the crossroads of their lives — between big life events that may have already occurred, such as buying a home and getting married, and the children they raised are becoming financially independent, also known as empty nesting. When expenses start to dwindle is the perfect time for 50-somethings to start ramping up their retirement savings, especially if they don't have much in those accounts. By your 50s, you should have saved four or five times your annual salary, though those in their 50s have an estimated median savings of about $117,000, according to a 2015 Government Accountability Office analysis. Unfortunately, some people just can't afford to retire yet.

You don't file these worksheets with your return, but you should keep them with your tax records for the year.

• Roth IRAs set up in your name are exempt from the required minimum distribution (RMD) rules, which force you to start taking taxable withdrawals from other types of tax-favored retirement accounts, including traditional IRAs, after reaching age 70½. With a traditional IRA, if you fail to withdraw the proper RMD amount for a year, you owe a 50% penalty on the difference between the amount you should have taken out and what you actually took out (if anything). Ouch. In contrast, you can leave Roth IRA balances untouched for as long as you wish and continue earning federal-income-tax-free income and gains. When you die, your remaining Roth IRA balances can be left to your heirs who can then take out the money federal-income-tax-free.

The shutdown fight isn't really about Democrats v. Republicans; its about Trump against the reality that neither Republicansnor Democrats support his wall. There simply aren't enough votes in Congress for Trump to secure a win. In a constitutional democracy, that would likely mean Trump is out of luck. But Trump has the instincts of an authoritarian. He does not believe ordinary rules apply to him.
There have been a number of big misses in 2017, the most significant being in March when ADP payrolls rose 255K and BLS private payrolls rose just 59K, he said, in a note. In 2017, the average absolute error was roughly 49,000, he said.
To put such a COLA modification into perspective, consider that the average monthly Social Security benefit is $1,404. The COLA for next year is 2.8%, which would otherwise increase this monthly payment by $39. A reduction of that COLA by 1 percentage point would reduce the monthly increase to $25, or $14 less.
As more and more capital flows to index funds — and certain index funds such as those tracking the S&P 500 receive disproportionate amounts of investor capital — the valuation of the indexed constituent companies increases. While some investors consider the valuation of the index components when allocating to specific index funds, many and perhaps most do not. We would expect that many if not most investors picked an index fund when they signed up for their 401(k) plans and never looked back.
Almost all DDGS that China imports comes from the U.S. The country bought 6.8 million tons of the feed ingredient worth $2 billion from the U.S. in 2015, up from $1.8 billion for 5.4 million tons in the previous year, Chinese customs data showed.
Sometimes, as in your brother's case, the restitution does not fit the crime: $100 is the price most people pay for their cellphone or cable bill, or on a meal at an upscale restaurant. It's a token payment. It doesn't seem fair, and it's not a lot to pay every month, but there are so many loopholes in U.S. law that allow people to avoid paying restitution to victims of crimes. Keeping your home in your spouse's name is certainly one way. Let's not forget that your brother spent time in a federal prison camp too, so his punishment has not all been financial. But, it does not make up for the emotional and financial collateral damage.
My wife and I are seeking professional counseling to help us walk this difficult road of trying to be supportive of our daughter while being totally against what we see as a controlling and manipulative relationship. We recognize there is nothing we can do to stop them from making and learning from their choices, as we all do eventually. But I don't have to reward their decision with a financial gift upon my passing either. I intend to alter my will to exclude my daughter from receiving any portion of my estate, unless she is no longer married or living with this man. I may, however, include some financial gifts for any future grandchildren in the form of college funds or IRAs. I don't want any part of my estate to go to, or be in control of, this coward and thief she wants to marry. What say you?

As MarketWatch's Tax Guy Bill Bischoff wrote, the new law limits your deduction for state and local income and property taxes to a combined total of $10,000 ($5,000 if you use married filing separate status). Foreign real property taxes can no longer be deducted. So no more property tax write-offs for your place in Cabo. However, you can still choose to deduct state and local sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes.

However, 2020 should not in any way be considered a down payment toward the U.S. meeting its 2025 Paris Agreement target of 26%-28% below 2005 levels, the group, which includes Hannah Pitt and Alfredo Rivera, said. The emission reductions of 2020 have come with an enormous toll of significant economic damage and human suffering. With coronavirus vaccines now in distribution, we expect economic activity to pick up again in 2021, but without meaningful structural changes in the carbon intensity of the U.S. economy, emissions will likely rise again as well.

Higher-income individuals must pay a surcharge in addition to the base premium for Part B coverage. For 2018, surcharges apply to singles with 2016 MAGI in excess of $85,000 and married joint-filing couples with 2016 MAGI in excess of $170,000. Including the surcharges (which go up as 2016 MAGI goes up), the 2018 Part B monthly premium for each covered person can be $187.50 ($2,250 for the full year), $267.90 ($3,215 for the full year), $348.30 ($4,180 for the full year), or $428.60 ($5,143 for the full year).

Still, there are issues to be mindful of, including relatively weak growth that was far less than the overall sector, he said. Saunders also expressed concerns that the improved performance comes as a result of the consumer's willingness to spend rather than any particular measures Macy's has taken.
Most advisers also agree that the decision to save first in a traditional or Roth 401(k) depends on the current and future expected tax brackets. In general, however, Vincent Barbera, a certified financial planner and managing partner with Newbridge Wealth recommends that Generation Xers — those born 1965 through 1980 — contribute first to a traditional 401(k). Odds are they need the tax deduction, he said.

This imbalance between humanity and finance was also reflected in the art collection he amassed which now forms the basis of the Getty Museum in California, according to Scarpa. One of the criticisms that was leveled at him as a collector was that he viewed every work of art as a trade. He bought artworks he thought were undervalued and this led him into antiques. But as a result it meant his collection was weak in masterpieces, he said.
Of course, history is never destiny, and Coolidge is only one observation — hardly a solid basis for a forecast. Moreover, unlike Trump, both Coolidge and Mellon were level-headed and temperate in their manner.

This graphic from HowMuch visualizes that squeezing (it calculates tax-bracket changes assuming filers use the standard deduction, which would increase under Trump's plan). As it shows, the richest taxpayers at the top see gains, and the poorest taxpayers at the bottom get hurt. But there is one slice of wealthy taxpayers in the upper brackets that would also get hurt — or, at least, benefit the least from the changes.
If anything, this lack of data will favor an even-more cautious approach from the Fed when it comes to normalizing monetary policy. This is particularly true since the latest inflation data (which comes from the funded Bureau of Labor Statistics) shows no imminent risk of an outbreak, he said.
Another issue is that in China the overlap between corporates and the state can often make it difficult to get a true financial picture. For instance, hugely profitable state banks in recent years have by some estimates accounted for 50% of the net profits of all listed Chinese companies. This could mean if China's banks had to recognize a substantial increase in bad debts, another wild card is the impact on the central government's fiscal position through lost tax revenue.

In fact, having a capital loss carryover could turn out to be a pretty good deal. The carryover can be used to shelter both short-term gains and long-term gains recognized next year and beyond. This can give you extra investing flexibility in those years, because you won't have to hold appreciated securities for over a year to get a lower tax rate. You'll pay 0% to the extent you can shelter gains with your loss carryover. If there are future tax rate increases (which I think are unlikely through at least 2022), capital loss carryovers into future years could turn out to be really valuable.
Vice President Pence, who was evacuated from the Capitol, should seriously consider working with the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to preserve democracy, Timmons added.

Borrowers whose circumstances have changed since they last filed their tax return — information that won't be reflected in the data retrieval tool — can use other documentation to prove their income, like pay stubs or a letter from their employer. But because those documents typically show net income and not gross income — which is available through tax documents and on which the calculation for income-driven repayment plans are usually based — borrowers' loan payments could wind up being higher, Kantrowitz said.

While incentivizing positive outcomes — for example, by adding provisions for random drug tests or employment requirements — your trust document should clearly spell out consequences for failure to adhere to the terms.
Even as the economy recovers, states' level of funding for their higher education institutions hasn't bounced back, the report found. The reasons for the cutbacks (or in two cases, the growth) in spending on colleges and universities vary based on state budget constraints, revenues and other factors. For example, it's likely North Dakota and Alaska were able to boost their higher education spending in part thanks to increased oil revenues, a resource not available in every state, said Tom Allison, the report's author.
President Donald Trump has left it to states to administer the vaccine program — tweeting that it was up to the states to administer and then calling some states very slow — meaning that stressed state health departments, which have already had to deal with testing, contact tracing, public information campaigns and deciding when or whether schools or businesses should be open or closed, are now tasked with handling the biggest public health effort in decades.

Under current law, the federal income tax basis of an inherited capital-gain asset is stepped up fair market value as of the decedent's date of death. So, if heirs sell inherited capital-gain assets, they only owe federal capital gains tax on the post-death appreciation, if any. This provision can be a huge tax-saver for greatly-appreciated inherited assets — such as personal residences that were acquired many years ago for next to nothing and are now worth millions. The Biden plan would eliminate this tax-saving provision.
Sockwell: One misconception is that the court cares if he cheated and you'll get a bigger settlement. It varies state by state.

For taxpayers, the payments are based off what they earned in their 2019 tax returns, which are the ones people filed in mid-July or mid-October if they got an extension. The IRS says it's using the banking information it already has on file from those returns.

On Monday, with cameras capturing Ma and Trump in the marbled lobby of Trump Tower following their meeting — which they both characterized as great — Ma said he's going to work with the incoming administration to support 1 million small businesses in an efforts to sell products in China and Southeast Asia. Despite referring to that 1 million figure as representing U.S. jobs in an Alibaba blog post, neither Ma nor Trump elaborated on whether any of these would be full-time corporate jobs stationed in the U.S., or whether they'd simply be an outgrowth of the third-party network of sellers on Alibaba's e-commerce sites, many of whom likely also sell products on other e-commerce sites, such as Amazon and eBay.

Shares of telecom equipment supplier Ciena Corp. CIEN, -2.93% rose 3.2% in Tuesday morning trading following an upgrade to buy from analysts at Goldman Sachs.

Under Section 10A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, PwC is also required to independently investigate all of the allegations made by short sellers and others against Valeant regarding Philidor. The auditor must make its own determination whether anything illegal occurred and what the possible effect might be on the financial statements. PwC also must review the status of any internal investigation of the allegations against Valeant, and determine whether the audit committee and the rest of the board of directors have been adequately informed of any illegal acts.
The closest we can come to Trump among former U.S. presidents might be Calvin Coolidge, an extremely pro-business tax cutter. The chief business of the American people is business, Coolidge famously declared, while his treasury secretary, Andrew Mellon — one of America's wealthiest men — advocated tax cuts for the rich, which would trickle down in benefits to the less fortunate.
Americans had more than $420 billion in credit card debt as of late 2018, according to personal finance website NerdWallet, and the average household with credit-card debt has nearly $7,000 in revolving debt that carries over from month to month. And those households are paying a hefty sum in interest.
The Federal Litigation Unit, a government agency charged with overseeing federal restitution, can garnish a paycheck, seize assets, tax refunds, 401(k), retirement accounts and an inheritance in order to help pay off the full amount owed. But the Justice Department states: Unfortunately, as a practical matter, a defendant who has no money or potential to make money may be unlikely to ever make meaningful restitution to the victims of a crime. That could include keeping assets in a partner's name. But it's not a perfect system.
President Emmanuel Macron sought to impose a new tax on petrol, which is already terribly expensive in France. The bankers in Paris ride the subway but folks in the hinterland must fuel up to get to work. Most discretionary driving has already been taxed away — the levy would have had little impact on CO2 emissions but create much hardship.

NEW HAVEN, Conn. (Project Syndicate) — Speculative markets have always been vulnerable to illusion. But seeing the folly in markets provides no clear advantage in forecasting outcomes, because changes in the force of the illusion are difficult to predict.
Once your cash-flow plan is outlined, things fall into place. At this point, there will be a clear picture of what portion income will come from investments, savings, what the pre-retiree and retiree can expect their tax liability to be, etc., Grenier said. If necessary, adjustments can be made to lifestyle, expenses and investments to assure that in retirement expenses can be meet, vacations taken and provide peace of mind that they will not outlive their assets.
These aren't promises of traditional labor-force jobs that many Americans dream of when they listen to Trump's rhetoric on job creation. They're merely part of a publicity stunt that plays on Alibaba's previous announcements to expand its presence outside of China, particularly in the U.S.
2. It's likely to be the most important donation you'll ever make. An Internal Revenue Service study found that a typical bequest is almost three times as large as the total amount that person has donated in his or her lifetime (on FreeWill, it averages at $69,000). Choosing causes on which you're going to have an enormous impact is immensely satisfying. But with so much money at stake, it's worth thinking carefully about where you want to have impact and why.
Still, if you are like most investors, probably 90%, what you really want to know is exactly what to do. Instructions, in other words.
Proposals to privatize or scrap these systems face strong political opposition. Plus, the proponents can't guarantee that future generations would be better off. Shoring up the current systems, by contrast, would ensure that today's workers get the benefits they've been promised.

Hypothetical portfolio – John and Jane
1. It makes estate planning easier to think about (and sometimes even enjoyable). Only 54% of U.S. adults over 55 have a will that directs where their money will go once they pass away. And fewer than 30 percent of all Americans have an up-to-date will. One big reason so many of us die without making our wishes known to our loved ones and others is that dying is an event we may not want to contemplate. Framing a discussion in a more positive light — about the impact you would like to make, from saving the redwoods to supporting your local church or synagogue — triggers happy memories. That transforms a potentially miserable process into a source of joy.
Index funds are a growing segment of the world, but this thinking implies that index funds are now the marginal price setter of the market. This might be becoming increasingly true, but as of 2015 index funds were still a relatively small piece of all asset managers at just 34%. Bear in mind, much of this money is simply index funds inside of active strategies. (See the rise of the many tactical asset allocation ETFs, for instance.) The annual turnover of the 100 largest ETFs is 864%, which shows that ETFs are far more active than most people think.
Those factors may be offering gold room to run higher, at least in the near term.
The refund delay for a return that claims either of the aforementioned credits affects the entire refund shown on the return — not just the portion of the refund caused by claiming one or both of the credits. Although the IRS will begin releasing refunds for returns claiming the credits on February 15, it is unlikely that the refund will arrive in your bank account or be available on your debit card before the week of Feb. 27, due the time it takes for bank account deposits and debit card credits to roll through the financial system. Note that the Feb. 27 date assumes that your return has no processing issues and you that you choose the direct deposit option or debit card option to receive your refund.

This overlap will likely contribute to a more seamless process of at least reviewing legislation in Congress, Altman said. Now that the Democrats have the gavel, they can hold hearings, mark it up and bring it to the floor, she said. Senators will also likely look at other parts of Social Security to tweak, such as one regarding the Windfall Elimination Provision, which adjusts benefits for people who receive non-covered pensions, such as teachers, firefighters, police officers and other public employees.
Renting may be better than owning to build wealth — if you're disciplined enough to invest the money you save by not owning a property, a 2017 study suggested. When considering buying and building wealth through equity appreciation versus renting, and reinvesting in a portfolio of stocks and bonds, property appreciation does not change the results, co-author Ken Johnson, real estate economist at Florida Atlantic University's College of Business, said.

Investments — Review, rebalance and update if necessary with your adviser.
If your business pays nonemployee compensation aggregating to $600 or more to a single payee (payment recipient) in a calendar year, the business must file a Form 1099-MISC to report the payments. Similarly, employers must report wages paid to employees on Form W-2. Previously, these forms were required to be filed with the IRS and Social Security Administration (SSA) by the last day of February or by March 31 if filed electronically. Copies were required to be supplied to payees and employees by January 31 of the following year. Recent legislation moved up the deadline for filing with the IRS and SSA to Jan. 31 of the following year. So the IRS/SSA filing deadline for Forms 1099-MISC and W-2 that show payments made last year is Jan. 31, 2017. This rapidly approaching due date applies whether you submit the forms on paper or electronically.

Calculating the ratio is a key exercise in Your Money or Your Life, a guidebook for the simple living and early retirement movements, first published in 1992. Authors Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin suggested adding up the annual earnings over your entire life, as reported in Social Security statements or old tax returns. To that total, you can add in other money received that wasn't reported to Social Security, such as investment and interest income, inheritances, gifts and gambling winnings.
When people do estate planning, they often don't think about supporting the causes that have been important to them.

Medicare Part A coverage is commonly called Medicare hospital insurance. It covers inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing facility care, and some home health care services. You don't have to pay premiums for Part A coverage if you paid Medicare taxes for 40 or more quarters during your working years. In that case, you're considered to have paid your Part A premiums via Medicare taxes on wages and/or self-employment income. However, some individuals did not pay Medicare taxes for enough months while working and must pay for Part A coverage.
Tyrrell said it is likely telemarketers can access existing numbers, but anyone who wants to add a new phone number cannot. This will have a larger effect on legitimate telemarketers than robocalls exclusively for scams, he said.
On the stuff front, the things we buy for free time activities is vastly more voluminous than the stuff we buy for work. And when we suddenly have more free time, I don't know how realistic it is that we will never want to buy things that aid the activities we'll fill that free time with. If left to our own devices, wouldn't we actually be likely to want more stuff, because we'll have more time to spend on hobbies? Even Mr. Money Mustache has a whole bunch of bikes, guitars, tools and other non-free hobby stuff. We may have more time to hunt for deals and find things used, but we've made sure to account for this tendency in our future spending.

A new floor: From a technical perspective, gold hasn't looked this good in a long time. The precious metal has touched $1,350 an ounce a few times over the past few years and has been pretty stable between $1,200 and $1,250 since the last test of those highs back in September. We've yet to break out to the upside, but a clear pattern of higher lows is an incredibly encouraging sign that we've found a new floor for prices. And with recent moves up through the important round number of $1,300, there's a good chance we keep powering higher.

Last year, I interviewed six white collar criminals and, while some were genuinely contrite, some were not in a position to pay off all the money they stole from their companies; they made very small payments to the injured parties every month, and also went on to become part of a speaker bureau, earning a few hundred dollars per speech up to $5,000. One of the half-dozen I spoke with still insisted that his fraud was accidental, which can't be of great (if any) consolation to the victims. (His fraud totaled $4.5 million and he repays $500 a month.) Another white-collar criminal embezzled $13.5 million and had to pay around $7.5 million restitution, and pays $200 a month, based on his reported income.
The HSA is a bit trickier, but depending on their cash flow and savings it is equally critical, said Boudreaux.

The tax savings from participating in FSA plans are permanent so failing to sign up is like leaving cash on the table. Don't do that!

While reconciliation could be powerful tool — especially if Democrats use it twice in one year, as Republicans did in 2017 — the narrow margins in both chambers mean leaders will have to thread the needle in writing bills.

Americans are also buying homes that are larger and pricier; average home size was 2,720 square feet in 2015, up from 2,660 square feet in 2014. And the average price of new homes for sale in 2015 was $351,000, up from $100,000 in 2009. (Still, this doesn't necessarily reflect the housing market's strength, as new construction has mostly happened in the high-end market.)

With a deferred annuity, you put in your cash and you are not taxed on earnings until you take money out. It is like an IRA in that respect but there are no contribution limits or Required Minimum Distributions.
Obviously, you cannot plan your whole life around taxes. That said, most major life events have significant tax consequences, and over the long run taxes may be by far your highest expense category. So tax planning is important. Also, there is often a right way and a wrong way to do things tax-wise, whether it's selling your home, transferring funds from one retirement account into another, getting married, getting divorced or adopting a child, among others. To make sure you do things the right way, consult your tax pro before a deal is done. Take it from me: our beloved Internal Revenue Code is riddled with traps for the unwary, and the tax savings from obtaining competent professional advice will dwarf the fees over the long haul.

Transitions can be hard — whether the retiree is at a traditional age, such as around 65, or earlier, like in their 50s or even 40s. Many people are taking early retirement more seriously — there's a whole movement for it, called FIRE, short for financial independence, retire early — but there are hard lessons that come with this freedom, such as a loss of identity from leaving the workforce or an unbearable amount of free time.

The Fed, like the world's other central banks, is steadily debasing the currency, in order to create inflation. A Google Ngrams search of books shows that use of the term inflation targeting began growing exponentially in the early 1990s, when the target was typically far below actual inflation. The idea that we actually want moderate positive inflation — price stability, not zero inflation — appears to have started to take shape in policy circles around the time of the 1990-1991 recession. Lawrence Summers argued that the public has an irrational resistance to the declining nominal wages that some would have to suffer in a zero-inflation regime.
Outside of the U.S., British Prime Minister Theresa May said Tuesday that the U.K. wants a clean break from the European Union, including leaving the so-called single market and customs union, which would allow the country to exercise tighter controls over its borders.

Along with the financial considerations, think about the non-money aspects that make up retirement. I know you said you're tired of unfulfilling, soul-crushing jobs, but switching from work to no clear plan for what to do with your days could be disastrous for your mental and emotional well-being. Not everyone has a clear vision for their retirement, but now would be the time to make a list of some possible paths. This could be volunteer work, or more time with the family, or perhaps the type of job that brings in significantly less money but also makes you happier.

Baime said his organization has heard from its member schools with great concern about students unable to complete their FAFSA due to the tax transcript issue. Unfortunately, this issue is likely affecting students who need the funds the most — college officials say they observe that low-income students are more likely to be flagged for verification.

If your enough doesn't check off all of those — say, it has enough to cover your lifestyle, but not enough to sustain a recession or emergency in the early years of your retirement — then it's probably not actually enough. And conversely, if your enough easily checks off everything, and then some, there's a chance you're falling into the one more year syndrome trap and working longer than you need to.

A reduction in the top corporate tax rate to 20% from 35% could add $5 to $7 a share to S&P 500 earnings in 2017, said Russ Koesterich, co–portfolio manager of BlackRock's Global Allocation Fund, in a blog post. That would go a long way toward closing the gap between Wall Street expectations for earnings and reality, he said, providing a real-life tailwind, in the form of faster earnings growth, to a market increasingly driven by hope over experience.
Making adjustments to proposals in an attempt to attract members of the opposite side may discourage other legislators of the same party, who will then vote no to a bill, said Andrew Biggs, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Anything they try to do on Social Security has to be small and noncontroversial, he said. The problem — legislators from both sides of the aisle may have a hard time agreeing, as seen with the passage of the second stimulus package. Political parties are more divided than they used to be, Biggs said.

Hard money loans have higher interest rates (between 7% to 12%) and shorter repayment periods (usually 6 to 18 months). Although higher rates are offset by quick turnaround times, if it takes too long to sell the property, you could run the risk of defaulting on the loan and losing the property altogether.

There is no easy solution here. It gets trickier to maintain control over other parts of your estate if you deed it to relatives. For instance, leaving property to your grandchildren or daughter would be more complicated than merely setting up a trust, says Brandon Bellew, a lawyer in Clearwater, Fla. If you deeded it to your grandchildren, your daughter would be guardian over this asset if her children were minors when you passed away. If you left your home to your daughter, it could be deemed marital property, depending on the laws of her particular state. In other words, it could belong to both your daughter and her husband, regardless. Like people, the law can be stubborn and refuse to bend to our will.

Of course, there are tools within retirement accounts that allow investors to save more. Employer-sponsored retirement accounts, such as 401(k) and 403(b) plans, allow employees age 50 and older to contribute $6,000 more in their accounts, on top of the $18,500 maximum per year. SIMPLE 401(k) plans have a maximum contribution is $12,500 with a $3,000 catch-up contribution limit. Traditional and Roth IRAs have a maximum contribution of $5,500, and allow $1,000 more in catch-up contributions. (Roth IRAs also have income limits.) Consider the differences between pre-tax and after-tax accounts, said Melissa Sotudeh, a financial adviser at Halpern Financial in Rockville, Md., since tax-deferred plans' assets will draw down faster than after-tax plans because withdrawals will be taxed.

It was a tough time for the stock market with the S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% posting the worst-ever start to a new calendar year. But by the end of the first quarter, the scene had changed. The Fed signaled a pause, which in turn weakened the dollar, and ended up delivering just one rate rise in 2016 at its December meeting. Oil found a bottom below $30 a barrel and Beijing delivered a final dose of stimulus that helped underpin Chinese, and global, growth, Schulze said, in an interview.
Rosengren: We've intentionally pushed long-term rates down by having a big balance sheet. We've chosen a path which will not disrupt financial markets which means that our balance sheet comes down quite slowly. Until we have more normalized the balance sheet, it is not surprising that long rates are lower than they otherwise would be and it is not just what the U.S. is doing, it is what Japan and Europe are doing. So they are still expanding their balance sheets, even though we've been pulling back, and so that also is pushing down long-term rates as well.

Calls for the end of a more-than-three-decade bull market in bonds have been frequent of late. That has been particularly the case in the wake of President-elect Donald Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton in November, which resulted in a bond selloff that pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to around 2.60% in December from a low of 1.36% in July.
For example, most bloggers I know who write about early retirement talk about how much more they'll travel after they quit. Which is great. But: travel isn't free. And even travel hacking isn't free. It often falls into that spend to save fallacy that tricks us into believing we're saving money when really we're spending more. Or they assume they can practice geographical arbitrage by renting out their place while they travel, which is great if it works. But what if the market turns south for an extended time and renters are hard to find? What if the market becomes saturated and you can't rent your place out? Will you just skip the travel then? Or will you wish you'd boosted your spending estimate a bit more to be less reliant on a set of circumstances out of your control?

How you factor in inflation is also important, and whether you want to adjust numbers for inflation or adjust your projected rates of return downward to keep things in today's dollars terms. Inflation has historically tended to be in the 2% to 3% range annually, so if you believe that markets will continue to average roughly 8% in the future, you can run your projections at 5% (8% minus 3%) to get a sense of what that will do.

Alan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation, says that most people assume reducing the number of tax brackets is one way to simplify the U.S.'s extraordinarily complex tax code — which has been a rallying cry for politicians, particularly on the Republican side of the aisle.

When contemplating a Roth conversion, the challenges of analysis are compounded when one factor is in your favor (in this case, postponing required distributions) while another factor may be neutral or potentially even work against you. For example, if your heir's tax rate ends up being lower than your current tax rate, much of the benefit derived from postponing required distributions via Roth conversion could potentially be offset by the higher tax rate paid at the time of conversion (versus the lower tax rate your heirs would have paid on any savings remaining in a traditional IRA at the time of inheritance).

Health care continues to be the top expenditure with these tax refund payments over the next 100 days, according to the report Deferred Care: How Tax Refunds Enable Healthcare Spending by JPMorgan Chase Institute. Cash-strapped families are more likely to use the money towards health care — out-of-pocket medical expenses on debit cards increased 83% following a tax refund check, instead of no real change to credit card spending, suggesting the people who needed the money were the ones making the transactions after receiving a refund. Account holders in the top quintile (who had more than $3,500 in their accounts) saw an 11% rise in health care spending after receiving the refund, while people in the lowest quintile (with less than $536 in their accounts) increased health care spending by 220%.

To save for your retirement, you must first understand what it means to be financially free. Financial freedom means preserving your capital, earning yield on the wealth you're creating, and budgeting for your savings to outlast your days on this planet. The goal of financial freedom is to get to the point where your monthly income is greater than your monthly expenses. When you're spending, you'll be spending against your own earned money and not against what you hope you'll earn in the future. When rates on deposits drop below the inflation rate it becomes impossible to save for the future and so one must invest in more risky assets or in non correlated assets to escape this impossible savings conundrum.

If there is a small loan that a borrower really wants to pay off, he or she should attend to that if it helps keep the repayment of other loans on track.

More importantly, even if index funds are influencing valuations, then this should create more opportunities for more active managers. After all, if Ackman thinks the U.S. markets are overvalued and that the tide is essentially lifting all boats, then one has to wonder why he has any exposure to U.S. markets in the first place. The purpose of a more active strategy is to find slices of the market that won't expose investors to systemic risk. This is what the higher fees are supposed to justify, after all. If the more-active investor can't expose those uncorrelated corners of the market, then one has to wonder what purpose the manager is serving in the first place.

16. Plan for 2025. That's about the time we should have self-driving cars. And, as you get older, time proceeds faster (in your perception), which slows your reaction times. These and other factors tend to make driving skills decline over time. With self-driving cars will come far fewer accidents, and car ownership will change. More and more people will have shared cars (just call up a car, using an app), which should cut the cost of car ownership and use dramatically. And, it will aid many older retirees to maintain mobility. So, if you plan to purchase a car anytime soon, plan to keep it for 10 years, and realize that this might be the last car you purchase in your lifetime, as you will rent self-driving cars in the future.

Gold prices GLD, -0.58% are up roughly 6% in the last six months, which underperforms a gain of 11% for the S&P 500 but is still noteworthy. And since rolling back in early December, gold has surged more than 5% in just a few weeks while the S&P has barely budged.

Shares of Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants Inc. DRI, -0.91% ran up 1.7% toward a record high in premarket trade Monday, after the company raised its fiscal 2018 adjusted profit outlook. The company, which restaurant brands also include LongHorn Steakhouse, Yard House and Bahama Breeze, said it now expects adjusted earnings per share of $4.70 to $4.78 up from its previous guidance of $4.45 to $4.53. Separately, said as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the company estimates it will record a non-cash benefit of $70 million, or 56 cents a share, related to the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities. The company said it plans to make a $20 million investment in its workforce in 2018. The stock has shot up 23% over the past three months through Friday, while the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% has gained 7.6%.

The downside of using the reconciliation procedure is it could take longer than Democrats want and its use would require the bill to be more narrow in scope than they would prefer.
Next up on the prepayment menu are state and local income and property taxes that are due early next year. Prepaying those bills before year-end can decrease your 2020 federal income tax bill, because your itemized deductions total will be that much higher. However, the TCJA decreased the maximum amount you can deduct for state and local taxes to $10,000 or $5,000 if you use married filing separate status. So, beware of that limitation.
Positive public opinion for legalization will help keep legal sales on a fast pace, the report states.

Given such metrics as the current price-to-earnings ratio of 1,400, to name but one, the thesis that the electric vehicle maker is wildly overvalued is even more valid today than a year ago. But the timing of betting against it? Who knows. You know what Mr. Market says: The market can stay irrational longer than most investors can stay solvent. Mr. Market, if you haven't been introduced, was the character created by Warren Buffett's mentor—Benjamin Graham—in his 1949 classic The Intelligent Investor. In it, he warned of the dangers of market irrationality and group think.
• Germany's BioNTech is aiming to supply up to 2 billion doses of its COVID-19 vaccine in 2021, up from an earlier goal of 1.3 billion, after receiving emergency use authorization in both the U.S. and EU. In a regulatory filing, the company said it has committed to supplying more than 1 billion doses of the vaccine, which it co-developed with Pfizer. The partners are making the vaccine at six manufacturing sites and are aiming to expand the label to include pediatric indications, pregnant women and other sub-populations
After Collins was hit with charges, Pelosi called for tougher ethics measures, saying his indictment and arrest show the rampant culture of corruption and self-enrichment among Republicans in Washington today.
What lessons can we learn from this experience? One is that we shouldn't be surprised if our politicians will wait until the last minute to make necessary changes to the Social Security system. If so, then we probably should assume that Social Security's current payout rules will stay largely or completely in place for the next 15 years.
You can't sit on the sidelines as the Trump rally continues, but you have good reason to question its durability, wrote analysts at Montreal-based Pavilion, in a Monday note. The president-elect's tax plan will do little to boost growth, and will largely benefit high earners, crimping consumption and dramatically eroding fiscal balances.
Here's one last chart from SocGen that taps into another worry on the radar for investors — a recession threat. It shows that one in four U.S. stocks have 50% or more of their value erased in a recession:
GE stock GE, -2.65% was down 4% in midday trade Wednesday, and is down more than 20% over the past three months as a restructuring to return the company to profitability disappointed investors. The stock has lost more than 40% over the past 12 months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA DJIA, -0.46% has climbed 29.8% and the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% has added 23%.
In that example with the $35 million average payment, the first net payment — after the 25% federal withholding and the state taxes — would be about $16 million. The 30th installment would be north of $65 million.
File this if you are claiming nonrefundable tax credits other than the child tax credit or the new $500 credit for other dependents.

This is one of the best and shortest papers of the year. As you may know, I am a huge fan of indexing, and this paper gets right to the point. Indexing works because it's low-fee, tax-efficient and diversified. Enough said.

How actual smart people talk about themselves.
January is a natural time to take stock of your financial life, and to dream big dreams about 2018. Could this be the year you make the leap to homeownership? Or will you make a big change and trade in your mortgage payment for a landlord? While the housing market has slowly recovered from its dip in the 2000s, blind faith in housing gains has not. Homeownership rates hit a 50-year low in 2015, and first-time home buyers are now waiting a record six years to move from renting to buying. In fact, young adults looking to upgrade out of their one-bedroom apartments are increasingly renting single-family homes rather than buying. Single-family rentals — either detached homes or townhomes — make up the fastest-growing segment of the housing market, according to the Urban Institute.
Higher inflation and anticipation of Fed hiking have underpinned selling in bonds, lifting yields from a low in July of 1.36% to a high last month of about 2.6%. A plot of projections for future rate hikes by Fed members released last month, implies three rate increases in 2017.
And Vermont is just the latest New England state coaxing young professionals with financial perks. While Maine has no trouble drawing about 36 million tourists to explore its rocky coastline each year, getting local graduates to stay for good, or drawing in young professionals from other states, has been harder. (Its median age is also high; 44, or five years older than the median age across the rest of the country.) So the 2008 Opportunity Maine Tax Credit, which helps pay off the student loans of Maine residents, has expanded to out-of-state workers. After you move to Maine, the amount of money you put toward paying your student loans each year is subtracted from your state income taxes. So if you pay $1,800 in student loans, but you owe the state $2,000 in taxes, then you just pay Maine $200 at tax time.

Taxpayers reporting income in those ranges would see their marginal tax rate rise from 28% under current policy to 33% under the plan Trump proposed during his campaign. (Your marginal tax rate is the amount of tax paid on your next dollar of income, as you move into a higher tax bracket. It is not your overall, or effective, tax rate, which is typically lower.)
In a market reversal, decline or a flat/low-single-digit year, however — and especially if increased volatility pushes managers to sell into apparent trouble — funds may generate tax bills that equal or eclipse their growth; investors won't be happy with oversized tax bills on mediocre results.

The decline in employment was the first since last April, when the U.S. lost a gargantuan 20.8 million jobs in that one month alone.
While multiple comments from officials, as well as a lowered expectations of rate increases in 2019 from three to two already pointed to a change of sentiment at the Fed, the minutes hammered that point home on Wednesday. Some central bank officials had been in favor of pausing the rate increases in December already, and many agreed that the Fed could be patient with their hikes going forward.
As the table below shows, despite more years to save, older workers are nearly as anxious about not having a financial cushion as younger ones. When needed, they often tap retirement accounts to cover the shortfall — which doesn't help their second most common financial concern.
The company's first big break came in 2003, when it invested $8 million in Alibaba during the company's second round of fundraising. GGV Capital's founding partner, Thomas Ng, had put money into Alibaba in 1999, when the company was still operating out of an apartment in the eastern city of Hangzhou. The risky investment paid off as the value of its stake grew 30 times when Alibaba went public in 2014, Forbes reported.
If the decline holds, if would be the first since the second quarter of 2016, when EPS fell 2.5% to mark a fifth-straight quarter of declines.

Though that downward spiral for bond prices (yields rise as bond prices fall) has abated somewhat, prominent bond investor Bill Gross says the 10-year yield remains the most important factor in financial markets.
Under current law, the 12.4% Social Security tax hits the first $137,700 of 2020 wages or net self-employment income. Employees pay 6.2% via withholding from paychecks, and employers pay the remaining 6.2%. Self-employed individuals pay the entire 12.4% out of their own pockets via the self-employment (SE) tax. For 2020, the 12.4% Social Security tax cuts out once 2020 wages or net SE income exceed the $137,700 ceiling. For 2021 and beyond, the Social Security tax ceiling will be adjusted annually to account for inflation. As things currently stand, the 2021 ceiling will rise to $142,800.
Interestingly, the strength we have seen in sterling comes despite a sharp downturn in the UK manufacturing PMI.

This distinction is important to understand because the rise of less-active investors creates greater opportunities for more-active managers. This is due to the fact that a passive product requires active management. For every passive investor who doesn't want to waste time and money buying every stock in a stock index fund, there is a more-active manager or market maker ensuring that that product trades at the net asset value that that less-active investor desires.

The buy-versus-rent calculus is shifting toward renting being more affordable, said Daren Blomquist, senior vice president at Attom Data Solutions.

• Down market? The risk of a down market is critical to retirees. Early in retirement, a big drop in your portfolio can be particularly damaging. A diversified portfolio with the right mix of cash, high-quality bonds, and stocks helps with diversification, but it's not a guarantee that your portfolio won't lose value. In a down market, consider cutting discretionary expenses, if you can. Do this, and you'll limit the need to sell investments in a down market.
A must-have expense is one that can't be delayed or skipped without serious consequences. They include shelter costs, transportation, groceries, utilities, insurance, minimum loan payments and child care. In their book All Your Worth, bankruptcy expert (and current Massachusetts senator) Elizabeth Warren and her daughter Amelia Warren Tyagi recommend limiting must-haves to 50% of after-tax income.
Financial security isn't a number or a threshold. It has to do with what you spend, and save, relative to your income.
He's no more optimistic about the U.S. economy's ability to repeat its 2016 pickup in growth. The Fed's rate-hike cycle was still in its infancy, with the Fed having just delivered its first increase of the cycle in December 2015. Now, the delayed effects of past rate increases are starting to bite, he said, while the sugar rush from last year's tax cuts and other fiscal stimulus are set to fade, leading Capital Economics to expect a clear slowdown for the U.S. economy in 2019.

In a 2016 experiment, Berman's Common Cents lab, co-founded by behavioral economist and best-selling author Dan Ariely, relied on pre-commitment to help people almost double the amount of their tax refunds they saved. Users of the savings app Digit were asked by text message how much of their refund they wanted to set aside, sometimes after the funds had been deposited in their bank accounts and sometimes before they received the money. Users who committed to the goal before getting their refund saved 22% of it, vs. just 12% for those who pledged to save after they received the money.

The other is a naturally occurring illusion: the proximity of Dow 20,000.

Whatever happens, Dow 20,000 will still have a psychological impact on markets.
The Four Pillar Freedom blog's Zach created this chart to simplify what chipping away at your expenses could mean for your long-term prospects:
On the question of spending trends, it's worth thinking about whether level spending throughout your life is realistic. We plan to travel on the cheap in our 40s and 50s, but recognize that we probably won't be quite as enthused about crappy mattresses in cheap hotels in our 60s, and might even want to take a cruise or two (or fly first class once our miles are exhausted). Or we might get sick of living in a cold house in the mountains and decide we'd rather spend a little more to live at the beach. That's the thinking behind our two-phase retirement approach, with our leaner early years and our more cushy traditional retirement. Our plan is based on lower spending in the first 18 years of retirement, and then roughly doubled spending after age 60, perhaps more if our returns significantly outpace our projections. (Also helpful if we need long-term care, which currently costs multiple times what many early retirees plan to spend each year and is not covered by Medicare.)
That doesn't mean that we set new speculative-market records every day. Stock-price movements tend to approximate what economists call random walks, with prices reflecting small daily shocks that are about equally likely to be positive or negative. And random walks tend to go through long periods when they are well below their previous peak; the chance of setting a record soon is negligible, given how far prices would have to rise. But once they do reach a new record high, prices are far more likely to set additional records – probably not on consecutive days, but within a short interval.

Betz-Hamilton knows how hard it can be to repair a bad credit history — even a false one. She says it took her eight years to repair damage done to her credit. During that time, she says, her first credit card was canceled, and when she got a new one it had a $300 limit and 29.9% interest rate. She also was forced to pay 18.23% for a car loan, she says.
The legislation most likely to find its way back to the House is the MORE Act, or Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment and Expungement Act, which seeks to decriminalize cannabis at the federal level. The House voted in favor of the bill in December, but it was not expected to find favor in the then-Republican-controlled Senate.
Additionally, consumers should be aware how much interest they're earning on their banks accounts. Stock-trading platform Robinhood made a huge splash in December when it announced banking accounts that were set to earn 3% interest. Though the company has since delayed the rollout of these accounts amid regulatory scrutiny, the public's enthusiastic reaction to the announcement — some 850,000 people joined a waitlist for the accounts — shows that Americans are hungry to earn interest on their cash.

Of course, the report isn't the first to draw a connection between state disinvestment in higher education and rising tuition or growing student debt.

Asset rotation: Many stock-market investors are still optimistic after a great run in 2017, but it's undeniable that many traders are ready for what's next now that tax reform is priced in and the big run for equities looks long in the tooth.

Retirement savers cannot withdraw from their 401(k) plans before they turn 59 ½ years old (unless they become disabled or are separated from their employer after turning 55 years old). If distributions are made before 59 ½ years old, savers have to pay an additional 10% tax on the distribution (loans up to 50% of vested account balances are also allowed depending on the employer and plan, though they must be repaid within five years).
In addition to Trump's policies, investors will be monitoring the president-elect's Twitter feed, which he has used to take shots at specific companies. On Tuesday, he criticized General Motors Co.

Social Security is known as the third-rail in politics — because it's highly charged and considered untouchable — and politicians typically can't agree on how to fix the program and its funding issues. Discussions around solutions can become controversial, especially considering so many people rely on the program to provide some, if not most, of their retirement income. Over the past few decades, legislators have argued over how to repair Social Security — such as raising taxes or reducing benefits.

12. I urge retirees to use caution when purchasing fixed annuities, and another newer type of (fixed) annuity—the longevity annuity. If interest rates do, in fact, increase, then better annuitization rates will likely appear, resulting in greater payouts from the annuities. While fixed annuities have a place to play for some retirees, purchasing one should likely be done with the aid of a fee-only adviser who possesses expertise in evaluating the strength of the life insurance company, the vitality of the state insurance guarantee fund which might be available in case of insurance company default, whether to structure the annuity with a CPI (inflation) rider or equivalent, whether to ladder fixed annuities over time, and to secure the better rates through shopping for no-load or low-load annuities.

Netflix Inc.'s stock NFLX, -3.75% rallied 0.9% in premarket trade Friday, after Deutsche Bank upgraded the streaming video service, citing expectations that Netflix will report better-than-expected results next week. Analyst Bryan Kraft raised his rating to hold, three months after starting coverage with a sell rating. He raised his stock price target to $110, but that was still 15% below Thursday's closing price of $129.18, from $92. Kraft said when he initiated coverage of Netflix, he believed the company had an attractive business model, but the stock was priced two years ahead of the fundamentals, and that a sale of the company was highly unlikely. His new rating and price target is based on a higher subscriber trajectory internationally, a lower tax rate and the believe that fourth-quarter results will beat guidance for international subscribers. The key driver of the stock price around earnings reports has predominantly been subscribers, Kraft wrote in a note to clients. Netflix is scheduled to report results after the market closes on Jan. 18. The stock has run up 29% over the past three months, while the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% has gained 6.5%.
Why investors are facing 'the Icarus dilemma' in 2018
Rosengren: The [Fed forecasts] in December had three tightenings. I actually think we'll probably need a little bit more than that. I'm hopeful that we can continue to do it gradually. Doing it gradually probably requires us to continue to be doing it though. So if we were to slow down for some reason, I would be worried that at some point we would have to start moving more quickly. I would be worried about moving quickly at a time when asset prices were already at very high valuations. I think being able to do it more leisurely is one reason why we haven't had as much of a slowdown and probably has reduced the probability of having a recession. In addition, fiscal policy being so stimulative is a period where you wouldn't expect an economic downturn either.

The dollar had rallied since last summer on prospects of higher inflation and higher interest rates as well as potential accelerated economic growth, if the new administration of President-elect Trump delivers on promised fiscal stimulus.
After a study of county-level economic data, Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS Securities, concluded that the increase in oil prices was responsible for much of the rebound in fixed investment in 2017, including investments in drilling equipment, storage tanks, pipes, machinery, vehicles, worker housing, and the equipment needed to supply the required sand and water.

Many people appear not to understand that inflation is a change in the units of measurement. Unfortunately, although the 2% inflation target is largely a feel-good policy, people tend to draw too much inspiration from it. Irving Fisher called this fixation on nominal price growth the money illusion in an eponymous 1928 book.
This is why you must be diligent in selecting the right trustee. The trustee is responsible for gauging adherence to the terms and making distributions from the trust, and he or she can be empowered with varying levels of discretion. This person must be willing, able and equipped to withhold distributions if the beneficiary does not meet the conditions.
In the complex calculus that's required for the renting vs. buying decision, one variable stands out: Which is cheaper? If that seems like a tough question to answer, there's a good reason: crunch the data from America's largest cities, and you'll learn it's a perfectly split decision. According to an Urban Institute analysis, among 33 top metropolitan areas in the U.S., there are 17 places where buying is cheaper, and 16 where renting is cheaper. Home buying is a better option for those who plan to stay in one place for 3-5 years or more. It's also a good investment in many housing markets. According to the Urban Institute, here are 16 cities where buying is cheaper.

There are people who say things are getting pricey, but corporate fundamentals are there. Even if Trump's policies don't come to fruition, I think the fundamentals are strong enough to keep the market rising, said Peter Andersen, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co, who said he was fairly optimistic about U.S. stocks.
Mr. Trump's policies will take months to be put into effect, but in the meantime the markets will need to key off the U.S. data. Given the very high expectations, the possibility of disappointment is high, Schlossberg added.
Democratic Rep. John Larson, along with Democratic senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris van Hollen, introduced the Social Security 2100 Act to the House in 2019, which suggested applying the payroll tax to earnings of $400,000 and above, as opposed to $142,800 in 2021 (or $137,700 in 2020). The donut hole between these two figures would gradually narrow every year with inflation adjustments. The proposal also recommended increasing the special minimum benefit for people with very low earnings and using the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly as opposed to the CPI-W, the index Social Security currently uses tied to urban workers. A change to the index would mean Social Security benefits would better reflect the expenses of the elderly, as opposed to younger workers today.

The other missteps include the trade battle with China, which has undercut the benefits of the corporate tax cuts, and the Federal Reserve's belief that the effect on term yields from the pace of [its balance-sheet reduction] was somehow immune to a doubling of the budget deficit, he said.
The gains we saw last year were pretty amazing, and it's hard to imagine that we could replicate that success. However, growth has been subpar and we just got a fundamental change to the tax code. As those themes mature, we could see the rally persist, and it's reasonable to believe we could have another up market this year, said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago.

While Churchill's words came at the dark time of world war, I think the sentiment he expressed — of a sense of unity and fraternal association between the United Kingdom and United States — is just as true today as it has ever been, she added.
And a small company with balance-sheet problems can't do what the big boys do — go back to markets and do a rights issue. That ultimately leads to a higher bankruptcy risk and bigger risks for the economy, which gets harder to ignore. Looking at the Fed's reversal in policy it seems far more connected to what's going on in credit markets and in terms of weakening companies, he said.

Trump has proposed cutting the corporate tax rate from 35% to 15%, and stocks with the highest effective tax rates will be the clearest beneficiaries of any potential tax reform, wrote the team of analysts, who were led by David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist.
Rosengren: That's accurate. Financial conditions have not tightened significantly with the increase in short-term interest rates. Part of that is the stock market has gone up quite a bit and exchange rates and some of these other variables are being affected by a stimulative fiscal policy. So even while we're tightening with monetary policy, in some sense we have a more stimulative fiscal policy and over the course of the year people didn't know what, if any, tax change would occur. And now we know a tax change has actually occurred, so we now have a stimulative environment from the fiscal policy side that we didn't necessarily know was going to happen, so short-term interest rates have tightened but the long rate TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.402% is a little less than 2.5% right now. I would expect over time that it will gradually increase as we unwind our balance sheet and as it becomes clear that inflation really is picking up towards our 2% goal and that the tight labor markets are starting to have an impact on wages and prices over time.

The pandemic has the potential to make that deadline even sooner.

We would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $6.53 to $6.68 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth rates of 5% to 8%. Again, we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS with the euro at 109, our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.10 per share. Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS would range from $6.43 to $6.58 per share. At this early stage in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range, which, at approximately 5%, is higher than current consensus estimates.

It sounds like your income friend has an immediate annuity. He is NOT getting tax-free interest income. He is getting a monthly annuity payment of which a portion is not taxed. It is not taxed because it is considered a return of his investment principal.

In 2016, ETFs accounted for 30% of all U.S. trading in terms of value, and 23% in terms of share volume. Their usage represents remarkably swift adoption of an asset class that is not even 30 years old — the first launched in 1993. Trading growth could accelerate in 2017 with the implementation of the Labor Department's fiduciary rule, which is widely expected to favor ETFs.

For years I've lectured about the wonderfulness of Roth IRAs. The new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) makes Roth IRAs even more attractive and they can provide insurance against future tax rate increases that I think are almost inevitable. Here's what you need to know about Roth IRAs and especially Roth IRA conversions in the post-TCJA world.

What a treat to receive a letter that's not about someone borrowing money from his family and not wanting to repay it or trying to find out how to ask a friend or family member for money owed to them, but from someone who actually doesn't want to receive money from his family. I recently received a letter from a woman took money (as a loan) from her father and didn't want to repay it. Her father had died and, as she thought, so did the obligation to repay the money to her father's estate.
In addition, Sotudeh recommends re-enrolling in catch-up contributions for active retirement plans at work.

What does that mean? Here's the key distinction: Marginal tax rates are only applied to part of someone's income, not to all of their earnings. In other words, someone making $10 million would not lose 70% of that money to taxes under Ocasio-Cortez's proposal. A 70% marginal tax rate on earnings above $10 million would only apply to the portion of income above $10 million.

Energy and consumer discretionary stocks have been the biggest outperformers of the year so far, with both sectors up nearly 6%. Broadly, markets have been supported by improving economic data and an accommodative monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.

Other health care spending sparked by tax refunds: dentists and outstanding hospital bills. Almost a third of people spent money after receiving their tax refund on dentists, compared to 27% of in-person payments before receiving a tax refund. Another 39% of spending went toward nursing service providers, ambulance service providers, medical laboratories, opticians, optometrists and chiropractors. People were less likely to spend on doctors or hospitals than pre-tax refund payment.

If the Democrats manage to pull off the upsets in Georgia, then a key difference this time around, in my view, is that many of those same Democrat players who were there in 2009 would likely use their latest opportunity to advance greater fiscal spending to support the economic recovery. In a more-pronounced economic recovery, we would expect an even further rise in Treasury rates, tightening of municipal and corporate bond spreads, weakening of the dollar, and higher performance of value stocks and emerging market equities, added Brian Levitt, global market strategist at Invesco, in a note ahead of the results.
Can Wall Street close this gender gap?
Private equity funds and hedge funds have historically been structured as limited partnerships. Under prior law, so-called carried interest arrangements allowed private equity fund and hedge fund managers to give up their right to receive current fees for their services and instead receive an interest in future profits from the private equity/hedge fund partnership. These arrangements are often called carried interests because the private equity/hedge fund manager doesn't pay anything for the partnership profits interest. Also, the private equity/hedge fund manager is not taxed on the receipt of the carried interest because it's not considered a taxable event.
How has your life changed for the better since you ditched debt?

Most U.S. houses aren't designed with aging in mind. Only about 1% of the national housing stock can be considered truly accessible if you need a wheelchair, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.

Under prior law, such property generally had to be depreciated over 39 years, which is a long, long, time.

The vast majority of 2020's emission reductions were due to decreased economic activity and not from any structural changes that would deliver lasting reductions in the carbon intensity of our economy, the Rhodium researchers said. If COVID-19 and the resulting recession hadn't happened, we estimate that U.S. emissions would have declined by only around 3% this year, driven in large part by the decline of coal-fired power generation and to a lesser extent the reduction in heating demand due to warmer winter weather.
There are two nice attributes of interest and dividends: one, most portfolios generate them, and two, they're always positive. However, they might not be enough to generate the income you need. For John and Jane, portfolio growth boosted their return, which provides a third portfolio income stream in addition to what they're getting from interest and dividends. This may not happen every year. But on average, we expect that a diversified portfolio will grow over time.

For many years, Form 1120 C corporation returns have been due two and a half months after the end of the corporation's tax year. So for a calendar-year corporation, the deadline was March 15 of the following year (adjusted for weekends and holidays). However, recent legislation established new deadlines for corporate returns. For tax years beginning in 2016 and beyond, the Form 1120 due date is generally moved back by a month, to three and a half months after the close of the corporation's tax year, which translates to April 15 (adjusted for weekends and holidays) for a calendar-year corporation. So the filing deadline for 2016 returns of calendar-year corporations is April 18, 2017. Five-month extensions to September 15, 2017 can be obtained by filing Form 7004 by the un-extended due date (April 18 for a calendar-year corporation).

On Tuesday, Plummer was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.
But an HSA — if it and a high deductible health plan (HDHP) are part of your employee benefits package — complicates things a bit. That's partly because your tax bracket now and in retirement doesn't matter as much. The money goes into the HSA before taxes (like a traditional 401(k)); grows tax-free (as do traditional and Roth 401(k)s); and distributions are tax-free (like a Roth 401(k)) if used for health-care expenses in retirement.
The dollar has gained 2.4% in the last three months, as measured by the ICE dollar index, boosted by the Federal Reserve's interest-rate hike in mid-December. That strength means reduced sales for U.S. companies when money is repatriated from a country with a weaker currency. Dollar strength was repeatedly invoked in the first three earnings seasons of 2015 as a major headwind, with many companies making extra disclosures that attempted to strip out its effect.

Over the past 20 years he has paid what the judge told him to pay. It is about $100 a month. The way I figure it since the restitution started in 1992 and it is now 2015 that's 23 years at $1200 a year so he has paid $27,600.

History shows past shutdowns have had a negligible impact on stocks. So far, that's been the case with the partial shutdown that began on Dec. 21 and entered its 26th day on Wednesday with no end in sight with congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump at an impasse over his demand for funding for a $5.3 billion border wall. The closure has far exceeded the prior record, a 21-day shutdown during the Clinton administration that began in December 1995.

This task becomes more urgent when we're in our 50s. Our financial decision-making abilities generally peak around age 53, researchers have found, while rates of cognitive decline and dementia start to climb at age 60. As we age, we tend to become more vulnerable to fraud, scams, unethical advisers and bad judgment, says financial literacy expert Lewis Mandell, author of What to Do When I Get Stupid. Cleaning up our finances can help protect us.
If we paid better attention to the instances when we did muster the courage to say no, we'd realize that our world did not implode and our loved ones did not excommunicate us from family gatherings. Instead, we pay the greatest attention to the rare occasion when someone did push back on us with a vengeance and we felt guilty. The truth is that our friends, relatives and bosses usually accept our decision to say no. It helps to observe how others effectively say no, as well. When we watch them carry on with little repercussion, the lesson is learned. When you finally consider what's important and realize that saying no to others holds your values in high esteem, you'll be more inclined to eliminate unwanted, unnecessary obligations in your life.
Hard data also show that capital spending is softening. Real business investment surged at a 10% annual pace in the first half of the year, but slowed to 2.5% in the third quarter.

The Dow is up only 19% in real (inflation-adjusted) terms since 2000. A 19% increase in 17 years is underwhelming, and the national home price index that Case and I created is still 16% below its 2006 peak in real terms. But hardly anyone focuses on these inflation-corrected numbers.

Due to recent legislation, the IRS cannot issue refunds before Feb. 15, 2017 for personal returns that claim the earned income tax credit or the additional child tax credit.

But there are limitations to the procedure. The reconciliation bills cannot increase the budget deficit beyond the years covered by the budget resolution, which is why President Bush's tax cuts were originally temporary. The bills cannot deal with Social Security. And the changes proposed must have a budget effect by changing spending or revenues in a non-incidental way. Violations of those rules can result in the offending provisions being stripped out or the bill losing its filibuster protection.

3. Plan for the 'What-Ifs.' Give some thought to how you would manage if a financial shock hit — say, you were laid off or you and your partner split or one of you became ill. Having considered the financial ramifications in advance, even vaguely, will prove useful and maybe even comforting if the event comes to pass, at a time when your emotions will be running high.

The U.S. economy needs a higher rate of productivity if we want living standards to improve. The tax cut didn't change the weak trend in business investment.

With the Fed hiking rates, you can expect increased volatility. That, in turn, makes investors jumpy.

What's driving the market: The pound rally squeezed U.K. stocks and particularly weighed on the big multinationals in the FTSE. As around 75% of revenues for the index are made overseas, an appreciation in sterling hits profits when converted back into the U.K. currency. Sterling stayed higher even after data from IHS Markit/CIPS showed the U.K. manufacturing PMI dropped to 56.3 in December from November's 51-month high of 58.2. The consensus forecast called for a reading of 58, according to FactSet. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.

Shares of Humana Inc. HUM, +1.15% dropped 2.5% in morning trade Monday, to pull back from the previous session's record close, after the health care company provided 2018 membership growth estimates. Following results of the annual enrollment period, the company raised its net membership growth estimate for individual Medicare Advantage products to 180,000 to 200,000 members from an initial estimate of 150,000 to 180,000 member, as a result of higher-than-expected retention of existing members. For prescription drug plans, however, membership is estimated to decline by 280,000 to 320,000 members. The decline is primarily a result of the loss of auto assign members in Florida and South Carolina, due to pricing over the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) low income benchmark, continued membership declines in its Enhanced Plan and significantly lower-than-anticipated growth in the co-branded plan with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -1.31% given low-priced competitor offerings. Separately, the company affirmed its adjusted 2017 earnings-per-share guidance of about $11.60, which compares with the FactSet consensus of $11.63, and said it expects the tax reform legislation to reduce fourth-quarter net earnings by about $160 million.

Rosengren: I think there are some advantages of having a Fed-led discussion about how we should think about the framework. My own view is that we would be better off having a little more flexibility than having a specific inflation target. I would much rather have an inflation range – something more like 1.5%-3%. And that during times where interest rates were likely to be low because labor force growth was quite low and productivity was quite low, that would be a time that I would actually like a higher level of inflation so I would like to be higher in the range during that period. And during periods of very high productivity then we could be lower. And the reason for that is – and it is partly a financial stability concern – that the current framework where we have low productivity and low population growth and not much immigration, is an environment where we are going to hit the zero lower bound too frequently. And I do think that has significant consequences – both because monetary policy becomes less effective when we can't move short-term interest rates, and I also think that it changes investor and household behavior when you start having periods of prolonged interest rates that are very low and unchanged. So I would like to avoid those kind of outcomes occurring in future recessions and so I think it is a good time to be discussing what is the right framework to reduce that probability.

ETFs are increasingly favored by investors because they offer easy access to pretty much any sector, region, asset class, or strategy, typically with lower fees and greater tax efficiency than mutual funds. While the accessibility of ETFs, the largest of which are index funds, has played into the growing trend of passive investing, the spike in volume indicates that traders are also using the funds as short-term holdings rather than core positions in their portfolios.

However, Ma's assertion that he's going to create a million new jobs in the U.S. by helping small businesses sell products and services to China is a stretch. The Chinese e-commerce giant is merely upping its own investments to appeal to U.S. small businesses, providing them with incentives, such as user data and logistics capabilities, in hope that more American brands will sell items on its e-commerce sites. The increased demand for those U.S. goods from the Chinese middle class will prompt, it hopes, increased hiring as U.S. brands expand to meet the heightened demand.
So if you convert in 2019, you'll pay today's low tax rates on the extra income triggered by the conversion and completely avoid the potential for higher future rates on all the post-conversion income that will be earned in your Roth account. That's because Roth withdrawals taken after age 59½ are totally federal-income-tax-free, as long as you've had at least one Roth account open for over five years. So in effect, the Roth conversion strategy insures you against future tax rate increases that would otherwise hit withdrawals coming from your current traditional IRA balance plus future account earnings.

When taxes on the very wealthy are lowered, but raised for ordinary citizens to meet budgetary demands (whether from far-off Brussels or from well-off financiers), it should come as no surprise that some are angry. The Yellow Vests' refrain speaks to their concerns: The government talks about the end of the world. We are worried about the end of the month.

* The easiest deductible expense to prepay is included in the house payment due on January 1. Accelerating that payment into this year will give you 13 months' worth of itemized home mortgage interest deductions in 2020.

The prices of food to be consumed at home rose 1.6%, but because food accounts for a somewhat larger 13.6% of spending, even that modest increase was enough to boost the CPI by 0.07 percentage points.

It may seem unusual to set up a retirement account for your child, but there are benefits. When it comes to saving for retirement, the earlier the better, but these accounts can also be used for education purposes or just about anything else. Roth IRA withdrawals can be done tax-free so long as it's solely from he person's contributions, not earnings. So for example, say you contribute $1,000 every year for five years, you'd be able to take out $5,000 the following year and it would be tax- and penalty-free. Children can get started with a retirement account at a young age, even with neighborhood jobs like dog sitting. For parents who are self-employed, it can be particularly easy for kids to have an account opened if you hire them as a part-time worker.
Financial advisers, who have long worked with families to help them achieve their goals, often find themselves in the middle of these difficult situations, working with parents to put into place financial safeguards that protect not only family finances but also the well-being of the relative battling addiction.

If you hold investments in taxable brokerage firm accounts, consider the tax advantage of selling appreciated securities that have been held for over 12 months. The federal income tax rate on long-term capital gains recognized in 2020 is only 15% for most folks, although it can reach the maximum 20% rate at high income levels.

So, the true maximum rate for high-income individuals is 23.8%: the advertised 20% top rate plus 3.8% for the unadvertised NIIT.

• Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech said an in vitro study found that their COVID-19 vaccine neutralizes the two new highly infectious variants that have emerged in the U.K. and South Africa. The results were published on the preprint service bioRxiv and have not yet been peer-reviewed. Though these two rapidly spreading viruses are different, they share the N501Y mutation, which is located in the receptor binding site of the spike protein and results in the virus's spike protein binding more tightly to its receptor., the companies said in a joint statement. It has been shown to infect mice more efficiently. The trial found the sera of 20 participants in the Phase 3 trials neutralized the virus with the mutation as well as they neutralized the virus without the mutation, said the statement. Pfizer, BioNTech, and UTMB are encouraged by these early, in vitro study findings, said the statement, although further research is needed.

But the ratio of domestic after-tax profits to the net value added of corporate business (a crude way if imprecise way of saying revenue) was 15.9% in the third quarter — well above the 9.9% median over the last 50 years.
The market is completely missing something on the Goldman earnings, Steve Biggar, director of financial services research at Argus Research told MarketWatch. They had an unusual low tax rate of just 16.2%, down from 19% in the first three quarters of the year, he said.

Professionals in big cities profit from globalization but the working classes in suburbs, smaller cities and rural communities languish. Immigrants corrupt local cultures and incubate crime, and burdensome regulations and high taxes make starting a business and affording simple necessities too difficult.
Short-term rental properties, otherwise known as vacation rentals, can act as one of the best ways to generate significant income from your real estate holdings. Owners can charge higher rates a day than long-term investment properties and they can also potentially use the home themselves when renters do not occupy the property.
4. Bundled Payments Work, Study Finds, But HHS Nominee No Fan — A study found that Medicare's bundled payments model for joint replacement could save the government billions of dollars without harming patient care.
The IRS and the Treasury Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on when tax season starts this year. Last year, the IRS started accepting and processing returns on Jan. 27.
Of course, there are some benefits to homeownership, and they aren't just avoiding unexpected rent hikes and unpredictable landlords. Many people simply enjoy interior decorating and entertaining, Tabarrok added. And perhaps more importantly, home ownership is often tied to access to better public schools. The U.S. tax code also subsidizes houses.

But that's the wrong way to think about this. As Stephen Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt observe in How Democracies Die, the drift away from democracy can be gradual. There often isn't a single dramatic moment when jack-booted troops march in the streets: democracies [can] erode slowly, in barely visible steps. Claims that Trump is another Adolf Hitler or Josef Stalin are of course wild exaggerations. The danger to the U.S. is something more like Hungary under Prime Minister Viktor Orban or Turkey under President Recep Erdogan — countries that maintain a veneer of democracy while eviscerating its substance. Even actions that are not illegal can undermine constitutional democracy: Levitsky and Ziblatt observe that the system depends in part on unwritten norms that set limits on power.
Reports that the State Council is considering shaking up its various financial regulators by consolidating them, suggests that policy is still unclear.

There are just so, SO many morsels from this epic Stephen Miller interview with Jake Tapper on CNN.
First, we should note that much of the confusion in this debate stems from the mythical distinction between active and passive investing. As I've noted many times before, the market is composed entirely of active participants whose level of activity ranges from silly (high-fee day trading, for instance) to intelligent (your typical Boglehead-type of approach often referred to as passive indexing). Since the market is made up of one portfolio of all outstanding global financial assets, and all market participants deviate from this global cap-weighted portfolio, then the distinction between active (those who try to beat the market) and passive (those who try to capture the market return) is far murkier than most would have you believe.
Perhaps one of the clearest indications that a rally inspired by President-elect Donald Trump is starting to stall is shiny and yellow and is outperforming other assets by a healthy margin.
If Democrats win both seats in the Georgia runoff contests, that could make it easier for President-elect Joe Biden's administration to pass legislation that could influence trading in stocks, including the repeal of corporate tax cuts put in place under the Trump administration.

Retirement is a long ways away for him, he says — at least 30 years — but saving money early on means not worrying about putting away as much later down the road if he weren't able to do so.

Without knowing any of the parties, I would have to say that there are two potentially controlling people in this situation: There is the man who may or may not be usurping some or all of your daughter's time and there is the man who wants to punish her for making this choice. On this basis, your daughter is drawn to characteristics that may be all-too familiar. If you cannot make her pay for marrying this man while you are alive, you will do so after you are gone. You may not like him, you may never like him, but you will lose your daughter if you continue to insist that she does as you wish. She is 20 years old. She will make mistakes.

I've even managed to complete most of a bachelor's degree without taking on student loans.

•Your requirement contribution will most likely mushroom during a bear market. Insofar as the investments in your defined-benefit plan fail to live up to what your actuary previously assumed, your annual commitment will have to be much larger still. This is especially worth remembering now, given that we very likely are in a low-return environment for both stocks and bonds. Research Affiliates, for example, the well-known investment firm founded by Robert Arnott, forecasts that the S&P 500 over the next decade will produce a return of just 2.5% annualized, while intermediate-term corporate bonds are projected to produce a return of just 2.7% annualized.
Profit, as measured by per-share earnings, is faring even worse. The S&P 500 is on track for a 5.9% decline in earnings per share, according to FactSet.
Becoming a landlord and owning a long-term rental property (or several) is one of the most common ways to invest in physical real estate.

That helped to dull the pain of what was a difficult period.
According to USAMega.com, if one person wins the current lottery and the jackpot is $1.5 billion, the lump-sum payout will be $930 million. After federal taxes are withheld — and Uncle Sam requires that 25% of the winnings are withheld, but the winner presumably owes closer to 40% overall — the payment is a bit under $700 million, which may face additional state withholdings. If state tariffs are at the 5% or 6% rate, the net payout will be at or below $650 million. (The confusing discrepancy between what is withheld versus what someone at the top tax rate must pay is why plenty of past lottery winners wound up in tax trouble with Uncle Sam.)
Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in December he expects trading revenue to rise about 15% from the year-earlier period, as activity in fixed-income trading picked up after the November presidential election, while equity indexes surged to record levels, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Have you made the extent of your feelings known? If so, you have helped to create an environment where this man — himself only 24 — is more likely to decline your invitation to talk. Typically, invitations are issued in the spirit of goodwill. You want him to acknowledge you. Yet you have called him repulsive, a coward and a thief. They're strong words. He may be these things or it may be that you feel like he has stolen your daughter's affections or, indeed, your daughter. But a thief is someone who walks into a bank and asks the teller to hand over the money — not asks for the hand of the woman he loves.
The beginning of 2016 saw some moments when commodities notes such as iPath S&P GSCI Crude Oil Total Return ETN OIL, -6.93% were completely disconnected from the action of oil prices, trading at premiums rather than fair value mostly due to back-room technical reasons.

Questions on the FAFSA that require interactions with other agencies are also causing hiccups for some students and schools. In order to qualify for federal financial aid, male students need to register for the draft.

Colleges are able to look students up individually to make sure they're registered, he said.
Warning: The state and local tax prepayment drill can be a bad idea if you will owe the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for this year. That's because write-offs for state and local income and property taxes are completely disallowed under the AMT rules. Therefore, prepaying those expenses may do little or no tax-saving good if you will be in the AMT zone. Thankfully, changes included in the TCJA took millions of taxpayers out of AMT danger, but not everybody. Ask your tax adviser if you're in the clear for this year or not.

Now is also the time to begin using various types of accounts for retirement funds, said Patrick Amey, a financial adviser at advisory firm KHC Wealth Management Services in Overland Park, Kan. Max out employer-sponsored retirement accounts, such as a 401(k) or 403(b) plan, and use Roth Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). The third option is a taxable investment account, that they can use in the early years of their retirement as their tax-deferred accounts (the first two types) continue to grow.

They asked for our approval to get married over the Thanksgiving holiday, which I refused to give based on their behavior and lifestyle choices over the past two years, which my wife and I have found so disrespectful and hurtful.

Shares of Caterpillar Inc. CAT, -1.26% rallied 1.4% in morning trade Monday toward a record high, enough to pace the Dow Jones Industrial Average's DJIA, -0.46% gainers, after the mining and construction equipment maker was upgraded at J.P. Morgan. The stock's price gain of $2.25 added about 15.5 points to the price of the Dow, which was down 38 points. J.P. Morgan analyst Ann Duignan raised her rating to overweight from neutral and boosted her stock price target to $200 from $144, which ties her for the highest target among the 25 analysts surveyed by FactSet. Although the stock already soared 70% in 2017, the second-best calendar-year performance in the stock's history, according to FactSet, Duignan said she believes there is still significant upside to the stock. She said among the notable catalysts for the stock, the recent tax reform legislation should extend the cycle for Caterpillar's North America construction business and a lower tax rate supports higher through-cycle FCF. In addition, Duignan believes Caterpillar's resource business in si the second year of a 10-year upcycle.

Many people associate far-right extremism with the rise of Trump. It's true that hate crimes, anti-Semitism and the number of hate groups have risen sharply since his campaign began in 2015. And the QAnon movement – called both a collective delusion and a virtual cult – has gained widespread attention.

• China has locked down 4.9 million people in the city of Langfang as new infections raised concerns about a second wave in the country that has mostly contained the virus, Reuters reported. The National Health Commission reported 55 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, down from 103 a day earlier. Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, accounted for 40 of the 42 locally transmitted infections, with the capital and northeastern Heilongjiang province reporting one local case each.
An Associated Press analysis of data from government monitoring stations found that at least 38 million people in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana were exposed to unhealthy levels of wildfire smoke for at least five days in 2020.

This helps explain why electric vehicles, for all their hype, only account for about 2% of new car sales here in the United States. In Europe, tax breaks tend to be more generous, and the EV share of the market is about 5%. Depending on the car and the country, tax breaks on an electric car can be as much as $10,000—more than enough to sway buyer decisions, all else being equal.
It may be way too early to call the Trump rally over. Socks are sill boasting year-to-date gains and the Dow is on track to hit the 20,000 milestone, but it appears that there are some signs that the notion of Trump being a slam dunk for stocks isn't a certainty.

The current growth estimate compares with the average reported growth of 25.5% for the first three quarters of the year, and would represent the lowest expected growth since 7.3% in the third quarter of 2017. And for the first time since Q3 2017, the growth isn't expected to be unanimous: The utilities sector is the only one of 11 S&P 500 sectors expected to report an earnings decline.

One thing that's generally true is that folks that have income of $10 million or more, a lot of their income is what you would call unearned income: capital gains, or benefits from a business that you own or operate, and that may put you in a position where you're not necessarily taxed at what you might otherwise think based on the top marginal rate, he added.

Believe it or not, a retirement in the near future is feasible, some financial advisers said. How much money someone needs to accumulate before retiring depends greatly on the individual's circumstances and numerous factors. If you expect a shorter life expectancy and can live off $3,000 a month, you'd be right under the typical 4% withdrawal rate, said Kristin Sullivan, a financial adviser at Sullivan Financial Planning. He could likely withdraw more in the early retirement years knowing his withdrawals would drop quite a bit when Social Security kicks in, she said.
With so many stocks in the index flat or down, it should have been pretty easy to drop a bunch of losers and produce a win, yet only about 20% of large-cap funds were able to beat the S&P 500. Don't expect much better in 2016.

Sometimes, gifts can come with a gift tax, which could be due at any time. That is, the giver feels like he/she has a hold over the person who received the gift. And this tax could be due just when you least expect it. (Even gifts as small as concert tickets can result in the giver calling in favors or even taking advantage of the beneficiary of the gift.) If you accept money from your family, especially with no expectation that it be returned, you are indeed obliged to them for the rest of your life.
So far, investors have largely shrugged off Trump's campaign threats to label China a currency manipulator and to impose tariffs on imported goods. Since then, he's barely mentioned the protectionist measures that had been a substantial part of his campaign, noted Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda.
Jobless individuals in Arizona, California, New York, Louisiana, Rhode Island and Tennessee could begin to receive that additional aid this week, according to their state labor departments.
And if you're not investing in an employer-sponsored account (after all, only 14% of employers offer such plans, according to the U.S. Census Bureau) consider a Roth IRA, which more forgivingly allows investors to use those assets for an emergency should a situation arise. As opposed to other accounts, like a 401(k) plan, that place penalties on individuals who withdraw money from these accounts, investors can take money out of a Roth IRA penalty-free so long as they only take out the money they invested, and not the investment earnings of those assets. Some 30 year olds, like Packer, have numerous accounts. Packer and his wife, for instance, have been maxing out their 401(k) plans and Roth IRAs for a few years.
ClearBridge breaks big market selloffs into crashes and pullbacks. Crashes occur when stocks see a drawdown of 20% or more that lasts longer than a year. Pullbacks are selloffs of 15% or more that last less than a year. A look back at market performance shows crashes have been 2.5 times more likely to coincide with recessions.
But the lack of detail has prompted market participants to evaluate whether double-digit gains were justified, with stock prices moving sideways over the past week.

Here's the plan. If your total itemizable deductions for 2020 will be close to your standard deduction amount, consider making enough additional expenditures for itemized deduction items before year-end to exceed the standard deduction. Those prepayments will lower this year's tax bill. Next year, your standard deduction might be a bit bigger thanks to an inflation adjustment, and you can claim it then. Or it could be smaller, if major tax-increase legislation passes, which I think is unlikely.
Dimon said his bank JPM, +1.65% has benefited in fixed-income trading from the exit from that business by many European banks that are dealing with their own issues.

The speculation taking place in cryptocurrencies is a completely separate issue. There is no compelling reason why a cryptocurrency could not have a fixed exchange rate, like one U.S. dollar per bitcoin, nor is there a compelling reason why the total number of bitcoins could not increase at a fixed rate, say 2% a year. A currency is a stock, a number measured at a point in time, like the number of $100 bills outstanding on December 31, 2017.
It's like saying Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -3.44% , Etsy Inc. ETSY, -4.09% and eBay Inc.

Sure, they're all platforms connecting sellers and buyers, which are necessary tools in a modern economy in which even tiny merchants wish to reach potential customers across the globe. But their actual full-time, with-benefits workforces are much tinier. Alibaba has fewer than 36,500 global employees despite notching in as one of the most valuable Chinese companies, with a market capitalization of $230 billion, according to FactSet.

Maximizing earnings should be a main focus in your 40s, experts said. This includes negotiating salaries, asking for raises or finding additional income. If a salary isn't enough to support your lifestyle and retirement savings, there are two additional options: the first, create or look over your budget and see what can be cut — the second, consider a side hustle, said Jill Cornfield, who writes about retirement for personal finance site Bankrate.com. You can start with a hobby, or build a mini business and eventually make that side gig a full-time job if you'd like. Regardless, saving as much as you can is important. I have never heard someone who said 'I wish I hadn't saved so much.'

Parents and others should beware of potential gift taxes, however. The annual limit is $14,000 per child (and double if you have a spouse willing to gift that much). UTMA and UGMA accounts are irrevocable, which means you will not get access to the money back, so don't put away money you may need. You don't want to put yourself at risk for your own purposes because you were being very kind to your children, Boneparth said. The last thing you want to do is incur penalties because you didn't plan ahead or plan for emergencies appropriately.

Weak production: Across 2017, gold mining GDX, -1.72% was incredibly anemic, prompting a report from ANZ that noted gold output was at its lowest point since the financial crisis, with risks only getting greater.

But the collective result is less gold coming out of the ground, which should benefit gold investors in 2018.

Rosengren: Just having the data from the spring time roll off – we had the wireless prices changes, there were a couple other changes in prices that I think were tied to individual markets that really were not tied to overall inflation and so I think once we get to the spring time we're going to be seeing numbers much closer to 2%. In addition, we have pretty tight labor markets already, and if we continue to grow faster than potential, those labor markets are going to get even tighter. If we start seeing unemployment rates below 4%, that's a pretty tight labor market. You're already hearing lots of stories, I think, in some of the tight markets about the difficulty of getting labor and one way to respond to that is to offer higher wages to try to attract people either in the local market or from outside the local market. These things take time. They don't happen overnight. That's why there are long and variable lags in monetary policy. I do expect that over time it will have that impact. We'll see more wage pressures and we'll see with time more inflation.
One last point: When seeking out a professional adviser to assist you with exploring your Roth conversion options, you would do well to avoid advisers who demonstrate a strong, knee-jerk opinion (positive or negative) about the strategy.

Some strategies, including delaying the start of Social Security, may help you minimize taxes and maximize your lifetime income. Consulting with a tax pro before you retire can help you determine the best strategy.
Of course, the age in which someone retires is becoming fuzzy, said James Nichols, head of consumer solutions group at New York-based financial services firm Voya Financial, and people are expected to live longer in the future than they did decades ago. By these new standards, future retirees need to push away anxiety over potential money problems and get to business: take into account all expenses you'll possibly incur in retirement (such as health-care costs and bills), and save so you're not one of the many who are undersaved for retirement. That means taking the baby steps in your 50s to get to where you'd like to be in the future.
Juan Carlos Diaz, president of the American Nightlife Association, a trade association, says bars and clubs are well aware of the laws and are increasingly focused on training staff to spot drunken revelers, calm tense situations — and limit their own liability in the process.

The solution: Take good intentions out of the equation and automate the process, so you won't have to think about saving for that proverbial rainy day after a one-time set-up. It's a technique that's been used with great success in the 401(k) world, where more companies now default employees into their plans and automatically bump up their contributions every year. Employers who use these default settings have seen participation and savings rates rise dramatically.

Southwest Airlines Co. LUV, -1.34% said late Tuesday its board of directors agreed to pay a $1,000 bonus to all full-time and part-time employees to celebrate the recent passage of the tax reform legislation. The employees will get the bonus on Jan. 8. We are excited about the savings and additional capital, which we intend to put to work in several forms--to reward our hard-working employees, to reinvest in our business, to reward our shareholders, and to keep our costs and fares low for our customers, Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly said in a statement. Shares of Southwest rose 0.2% in late Tuesday trading after ending the regular trading session up 1.3%. Netflix Inc.

India stocks surge. India's GDP slowed in the second quarter, but remained the fastest in the world at a 7.1% rate of expansion. Furthermore, with China's economy definitely cooling off and investors leery of Europe amid Brexit and U.S. stocks after the plunge at the end of 2018, the timing may be right for a rotation into this rare bright spot of the global economy. It's a risky call, I know, but one that could really pay off.

The emotional and financial havoc addiction wreaks on families is staggering. Kids from stable, loving families become addicted and will go to great lengths to get money for drugs, even stealing from their parents or other family members. Many parents of chemically addicted children grapple with anger and guilt, and often spend thousands — even hundreds of thousands — of dollars on that child's rehabilitation. Oftentimes it's the money they had set aside for retirement.

Your future tax bracket matters, as well. If you anticipate your bracket will drop in retirement — which happens for most people, according to experts — making deductible contributions to individual retirement accounts now is a good plan, because the tax breaks from those contributions likely will outweigh any taxes you'll pay on future withdrawals of the IRAs. If you expect your marginal tax rate to be higher in retirement, making nondeductible contributions to a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, could be the better plan.

In these days of nonstop talk of decluttering, downsizing and minimalism, enough has taken on a meaning of not too much. Which it for sure does mean. But for those inclined to rush the journey to early retirement, it's worth reminding ourselves that it also means not too little. Especially if you're planning to quit work for good. There's a lot riding on that number, and it's essential that you not shrink it down too much, lest you find yourself short on funds at the very time, in your later years, when you're least able to hustle for more.

How credit scores predict what you will buy next
Shares of CSX Corp. CSX, +0.40% rose 1.5% late Tuesday after the railroad company reported adjusted earnings above Wall Street expectations. CSX said it earned $4.1 billion, or $4.62 a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with $458 million, or 49 cents a share, in the year-ago period. The net earnings included a $3.6 billion tax reform benefit and a $10 million restructuring charge, the company said. Adjusted for these and other items, CSX earned $573 million, or 64 cents a share. Sales reached $2.86 billion, from $3.04 billion a year ago. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected adjusted earnings of 56 cents a share on sales of $2.88 billion. The stock ended the regular trading session down 1.9%.

Some advisers, meanwhile, recommend an entirely different funding order. For his part, H. Jude Boudreaux, a certified financial planner and founder of Upperline Financial Planning, said Generation X and millenials, in a perfect world would contribute the maximum to their Roth 401(k) and their HSA. The younger and the lower your tax bracket, the less the Roth 401(k) hurts compared to the traditional 401k, and hopefully the longer they will have for the tax-free growth, he said.
2. Interest rate rises are likely to be modest, but will still affect bond returns. As interest rates rise, the value of bonds fall. The longer the duration of the bond, the more likely its fall in price. Since fixed income investments are a defensive part of a portfolio, designed in part to offer some stability to the overall value of the portfolio, retirees might consider instituting a ladder of CDs, purchased directly from banks (and keeping within FDIC limits). Most CDs over 1 year in maturity can be redeemed early with a 180-day interest penalty; if interest rates rise significantly, retirees can exercise this put, in essence, when it makes sense to incur the penalty to reap the higher interest rates for the remainder of the original CD term. A short-term bond fund may be added to the fixed income part of the portfolio, to provide some liquidity. Never forget the threat of inflation; while inflation has been low over the past decade, in particular, it could come roaring back at any time; a ladder of inflation-protected securities held in a tax-deferred (401(k) or IRA) account, or a bond fund containing TIPS, might be a prudent part of a person's fixed income portfolio, to help guard against inflation risk.

• Contact credit-reporting agencies. Parents should check with the agencies at least once a year to see if credit reports exist in their children's names, Griffin says. In most cases, children only have credit reports when they've been added to a parent's credit card as an authorized user. So if parents find that there is already a report in their child's name, they should request a copy. TransUnion also has an online form where parents can submit child-identity-theft inquiries.

Supreme Court to rule on Obama's bid to block deportations
American democracy depends on the principle that everyone is accountable to the rule of law, that there are limits even on what a president can do. But Trump has shown he does not accept the idea of limits on power, that he favors unilateral action over the interactive give and take of a constitutional democracy. When something or someone gets in his way — whether it's Robert Mueller, James Comey, Jeff Sessions, or Congress itself — his impulse is to bully his way through or around the obstacle. He doesn't let unwritten rules stop him from doing what he wants — whether it's profiting from his office, refusing to disclose his tax returns, or giving top jobs to unqualified family members.

While social media and the mobile revolution were great narratives in the last few years, fueling massive gains for the FAANGs and other high-profile tech stocks, the bloom is off the rose. From privacy concerns about Facebook FB, +2.02% to peak smartphone to a general decline in tech worship as Silicon Valley culture has been increasingly exposed as reckless and misogynist, it will be harder for Big Tech to rely on vague growth narratives and investor goodwill to support nosebleed valuations in 2019.

Her job involves reviewing all sorts of evidence, including reports and depositions, for clues on whether bars served a visibly drunk customer. It's not always an easy call. There are times where the bar is very busy and they do communicate with somebody, but they don't exhibit the behavior until after they leave the bar, she said.
Stocks ended higher Tuesday, taking back a chunk of the previous session's decline, as investors awaited the outcome of a pair of runoff elections in Georgia that will determine control of the U.S. Senate. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.58% rose around 168 points, or 0.6%, to close near 30,392, according to preliminary figures, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.29% gained around 26 points, or 0.7%, to end near 3,727. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.40% advanced around 121 points, or 0.9%, finishing near 12,819. Republicans will keep control of the upper chamber if they retain one of the two seats up for grabs in Tuesday's election. A Democratic sweep is seen giving President-elect Joe Biden room to push for a more aggressive round of fiscal stimulus after he takes office later this month, while also raising the prospect of a rollback of the 2017 corporate tax cut.
Shares of Citigroup Inc. C, +0.33% shed 0.5% in morning trade Wednesday, after UBS did an about-face on the banking giant, flipping to bearish from bullish, amid concerns over how new protectionist policies may affect Citigroup's global franchise. Analyst Saul Martinez gave the stock a rare sell rating, after it was at buy for nearly three years. He cut the stock price target to $58, which is 3.2% below current levels, from $64. Only 15% of companies covered by Citigroup have sell ratings. Citigroup's global franchise is generally a good thing, but it also leaves the company less levered to lower corporate tax rates and higher interest rates in the U.S., and more exposed to risks associated with the President-elect's protectionist policy stances, Martinez wrote in a note to clients. He said an underperforming Mexican franchise and Asia consumer businesses in slower growth markets also dampen his view. The stock has soared 20% since the election, while the SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF XLF, +0.52% has climbed 18% and the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% has gained 6%.

Zurich-based UBS UBSG, +3.96% UBS, +3.02% said Tuesday that net income in the three months to the end of December rose to 949 million Swiss francs ($931.5 million) from 858 million francs in the same quarter last year. UBS had originally posted year-earlier net profit for the year-earlier fourth-quarter of 963 million francs. However, that figure was subsequently lowered by the bank as part of its organizational changes, restatements and accounting adjustments.

The market's reaction to May's remarks revived the notion that most of the strongest impulses affecting the Treasury market will be a consequence of other markets and even foreign geopolitical events, said Ian Lyngen and Aaron Kohli, fixed-income strategists at BMO Capital Markets, in a Tuesday research note.
• What about taxes? Consider the tax implications of withdrawing income from your portfolio. For example, it typically makes sense to avoid selling any shares purchased within the last 12 months to limit short-term capital-gains tax treatment. Earnings withdrawn from a traditional IRA or 401(K) are taxed as ordinary income. Withdrawals from Roth IRAs or Roth 401(K) are not taxed at all.
* If you paid Medicare taxes for 30-39 quarters during your working years, the 2018 Part A premium was $237 per month ($2,844 for the full year). For 2019, the monthly premium is $240 ($2,880 for the full year).

5. If you're saving in an employee plan like a 401(k), make a target date retirement plan the backbone of your allocations. In one simple step, that will accomplish most of the things you should be doing. To increase your long-term return from this fund, allocate part of every contribution you make to an auxiliary fund such as a value fund, a small-cap blend fund, or a small-cap value fund.
Homebuyers might have a harder time getting proof of income for their home-loan applications. Lenders typically require a transcript, administered by the IRS and called Form 4506-T, which verifies income for potential homebuyers. Under a government shutdown, the only transcripts the IRS will issue are those related to disaster relief efforts, according to the contingency plan.
But there was no corresponding jump in the sales of untaxed drinks. They actually went down too, though only by a few percentage points. Instead, there was simply a huge jump in the sales of sugared and sweetened drinks in stores just outside the city.
Several of the most popular Trump trades have either stalled or reversed in recent weeks — a sign that the market's postelection exuberance is beginning to wane.
Ford Motor Co. F, +1.60% said Monday it was ceasing production in Brazil, closing two plants immediately and another by the end of the year, winding down sales of some Brazil-made vehicles as inventory is sold. Manufacturing operations in Argentina and Uruguay and the sales companies in other South America markets are not affected, Ford said. The company said it will keep some customer-support, product-development, and related operations in Brazil as well as its regional headquarters in São Paulo. The auto maker said it will facilitate possible reasonable alternatives for interested parties to take over the available plants. In connection with this decision, Ford expects to pre-tax charges around $4.1 billion, including about $2.5 billion in 2020 and about $1.6 billion in 2021. Shares of Ford added to gains on the news, recently up 2.3%. The stock has lost 0.3% in the past 12 months, contrasting with gains around 17% for the S&P 500 index. SPX, +0.29%
Similar results were seen when activity is measured by the value traded, as opposed to just the number of shares. The S&P ETF still came in first, with $19 billion traded in the fund each day, while a stock didn't enter the ranks until 13th place. By this metric, however, Apple Inc. AAPL, -3.39% was most active, with less than $1 billion traded.
All of these actions have chipped away at the foundations of our constitutional democracy. If Trump does declare a national emergency in order to gain access to funds used for some construction of the wall he craves, his action should be understood in this broader context. This is a president with clear authoritarian tendencies, who believes he can do as he likes. He is constantly testing the limits. Baselessly declaring a national emergency in order to get his way would be just the latest example. If Congress — which hasthe authority to stop the president if it chooses to do so — failed to act and allowed Trump to, once again, get what he wants, the message to Trump would be loud, clear, and dangerous.
Tesla Inc. stock rallied to an all-time high Thursday, boosted by one upgrade and hopes that a blue Senate will be a potential game changer for the Silicon Valley electric-car maker and other EV and alternative-energy companies.
Pot stocks implode. Remember all those aggressive pitches for bitcoin during the run-up to almost $20,000, and notice how they have evaporated? Expect the same thing to happen in the investing bubble that is marijuana stocks. I certainly don't begrudge traders who made money in picks like Tilray TLRY, -11.47% or Canopy Growth CGC, -5.15% last year. But the momentum looks to be moving to the downside, with a lot of pain in store for these stocks in 2019.
Now that we see how their portfolio performed, how do they generate the cash they need? They rebalance, as shown below:

• The European Medicines Agency said that the product information for BioNTech and Pfizer Inc.'s vaccine should be updated to say there are six doses in each vial. The authorization granted to the vaccine, which is referred to as Comirnaty in Europe, on Dec. 21 in the European Union says there are five doses in each vial. The EMA, which is the E.U.'s drugs regulator, said health care providers should use low dead-volume syringes or needles to extract what it says is an extra dose. The European Commission must next endorse the EMA's recommendation for it to move forward into clinical practice.
In some ways the government's hands are tied from last year's stock buying as it now has a substantial position to protect. Added to this, the original reason the party could not let its bull market die remains due to the potential political fallout from losses after it effectively orchestrated the bubble.

The law enforcement community is among those who have failed to understand the true nature and danger of far-right extremists. Over several decades, the FBI and other federal authorities have only intermittently paid attention to far-right extremists. In recent years, they have again acknowledged the extent of the threats they pose to the country. But it's not clear how long their attention will last.
You're right to say that investing these assets in something other than CDs would possibly have gotten you more money, but there's still time to make sound financial decisions. Sticking to low-interest accounts may feel comfortable, but you could actually be losing out on money in the future if these accounts do not keep up with inflation. The same can be said for housing — rent prices may fluctuate and rise much faster than your income, said Nadine Burns, president and chief executive officer of A New Path Financial.
Tesla was added to the S&P 500 index Dec. 21. The stock fell in that session and the next, but has been on an upward trajectory ever since. The stock has gained more than 750% in the past 12 months, compared with gains around 18% for the S&P.

Immediate annuities can be a very helpful part of one's retirement plan because nothing else is guaranteed to payout regardless of how long one lives. That guarantee has a lot of value for many people but from a purely rate of return perspective, these arrangements only pay off well if the annuitant has above-average longevity. The longer one lives, the better. If our 65-year-old lives to age 90, the IRR is about 4.6%, a strong result given no market risk.
The following table shows what analysts expected through Friday in terms of year-over-year EPS growth for the S&P 500 and each of the S&P 500's 11 sectors for the fourth and first quarters, as well as the change in estimates since Jan. 11 and Sept. 30.

The outsize gains in Goldman's stock Wednesday, however, also may be a reflection of an overall bounceback in a beaten-down asset that had been the worst performer among financial peers. Last year, Goldman shares fell 34.4%, versus a decline in the S&P 500 of 6.2% and a drop in the Financial Select Sector SPDR fund XLF, -1.04% of 14.7%, over the same period.
10. Other than keeping fees (and there are many hidden fees in investment products) and costs low, the next most important decision relates to strategic asset allocation—i.e., what is the target allocation to various asset classes (U.S. stocks, foreign stocks, fixed income investments, etc.) over the long term. Many retirees have investment portfolios that are either too aggressive or too conservative. And most risk tolerance questionnaires lack true insight into how much investment risk you NEED to take on, as opposed to how much risk you can tolerate. Developing a strategic asset allocation, as part of an overall investment policy, is an area that a fee-only, expert financial planner/investment adviser can help a retiree with.

DuPont Chief Financial Officer Nicholas Fanandakis: We expect net sales to be down low single digits versus prior year due to the impact of currency and continued challenges in agriculture and emerging markets. Currency will continue to impact the top line, as the dollar strengthens against most currencies, primarily the euro and the Brazilian real. Excluding currency, sales would be about even with prior year. The company expects 2016 operating earnings of $2.95 to $3.10 per share on flat sales excluding currency.
Dr. Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had warned in December that the U.S. would suffer more deaths every day for the following two to three months than the almost 3,000 who died in the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, or the 2,400 who died in the attack on Pearl Harbor.

More likely, tax increases would be phased in over time and combined with other changes, such as raising the full retirement age and lifting or eliminating the current cap on how much of our earnings are taxed. (The current 6.2% Social Security tax applies only to the first $128,700 of annual earnings in 2018, while the 1.45% Medicare tax applies to all earnings.) You can experiment with possible solutions using the American Academy of Actuaries' Social Security Game.
Despite recent weakness, Mellor thinks that the dollar will end 2017 stronger.
But these numbers are illusory. The U.S. has a national policy of overall inflation. The U.S. Federal Reserve has set an inflation objective of 2% in terms of the personal consumption expenditure deflator. This means that all prices should tend to go up by about 2% per year, or 22% per decade.

It's not simple, but Dorsainvil and other advisers say savers should not overlook the triple tax benefit HSAs when funding retirements accounts: contributions reduce your taxable income for the respective tax year, withdrawals for qualified medical expenses comes out tax-free and should you need to use the funds after age 65 there is no tax penalty.

Still, even though Wall Street stalled in the final sessions of 2016, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.1% in its last week of the year, it has been in a fairly pronounced uptrend since early November, when Trump won the U.S. presidential election. While financial stocks have accounted for the lion's share of the market's postelection gains, investors are betting that the policies Trump is expected to pursue will accelerate economic growth.

What can you learn from all of this? To accept the terms of your brother's restitution. As one of the people impacted (indirectly, at least) by his crime, you can choose to suffer all these years later, or move on. That's easier said than done, of course. But there are some things you can do in order to make that happen. This might involve a trip to the aforementioned lawyer to put your mind to rest regarding your brother's restitution and your mother's will, speaking to your brother about how you feel his crime has impacted your family, or focusing on making your mother's final years comfortable and happy.
I ended up in New York at Columbia Law School and took out a lot of student loans, a little over $200,000 by the end. It was a much bigger financial decision than anyone in my family had to make before. So I just blindly went all in. It also happened to be 2008, so it was a terrible time to take on loans. Many of my interest rates were around 8%.
I appreciate the thought, but it does make me uncomfortable to accept financial gifts, partially because I know that some of these family members are not in great shape themselves and could probably use the money more responsibly, and partially because the decision and commitment to a property and mortgage were ones that I made alone, and I don't feel they should have to contribute in any way.

REITs are individual companies that own commercial properties such as hotels, apartments, office buildings and retail spaces. These investments usually pay high dividends and get used regularly in retirement funds. They do so because by keeping your REITs in a nontaxable retirement account, you can automatically reinvest your dividends without a tax consequence, allowing your money to grow even further.

8. Get the big purchases right. I know I shouldn't be so judgmental but whenever I see $50,000-$70,000 SUVs on the road or enormous McMansions, the first thing that pops into my head is, I wonder how much they have saved for retirement? Personal finance experts love to debate the minutia of brown-bag lunches and lattes, but the most important purchases in terms of keeping your finances in order will be the big ones — housing and transportation. Overextending yourself on these can be a killer.

There is, in short, a gross mistrust in governments and politicians, which means that asking for sacrifices today in exchange for the promise of a better life tomorrow won't pass muster. And this is especially true of trickle down policies: tax cuts for the rich that eventually are supposed to benefit everyone else.
Revenue growth is also expected to decelerate, with the FactSet blended growth estimate of 6.6% well below the average of 9.7% for the first three quarters of 2018, and the slowest growth since the third quarter of 2017's 6.2% rise. The fourth-quarter estimate, as well as the first-quarter outlook, has declined slightly over the past week.

For many years, Form 1065 partnership returns have been due three and a half months after the end of the partnership tax year. Ditto for returns of LLCs that are treated as partnerships for tax purposes. So for a calendar-year partnership or LLC, the filing deadline was April 15 of the following year (adjusted for weekends and holidays). However, recent legislation changed the deal. For partnership and LLC tax years beginning in 2016 and beyond, the Form 1065 due date is moved up by one month, to two and a half months after the close of the tax year. So the deadline for 2016 returns of calendar-year partnerships and LLCs is March 15, 2017. Six-month extensions to September 15, 2017 can be obtained by filing Form 7004 (Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File Certain Business Income Tax, Information, and Other Returns) by the un-extended due date (March 15 for a calendar-year partnership or LLC).
I am not surprised by the reversal we have seen in relative performance between gold and US stocks so far in 2017. The big rally at the end of last year was partly driven by speculation on what Donald Trump could do for the economy as president and part due to a scramble by fund managers to get cash off the sidelines and into the market by year-end which is now over, said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. It also seemed to me like the Dow was getting drawn toward 20,000 as though it was caught in a tractor beam, he said.
3. Pay attention to taxes. Invest in a 401(k) or similar retirement account if one is available to you — with luck, you could even get matching funds from your employer. Maximize your use of IRA accounts, and choose a Roth IRA for its long-term tax advantages.
If, instead, the Fed persists is raising the funds rate to the point that it exceeds the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a recession would be the likely outcome.

Regulators would do well to get extensive feedback from sophisticated investors and innovators who understand crytocurrencies and their possible uses, as these sorts of developments are as unknown and incapable of being understood by policymakers today as the automobile was at the turn of the 20th Century. Specifically, we are attempting to regulate a decentralized network of trust that has never existed before, and must resist impulses to treat it like a centralized network, where if the intermediary (e.g. bank) is protected, the system remains safe. In this crypto-world, with no central intermediary, it will be only possible to understand how to properly regulate once the industry matures a bit and has found a purpose in the economy.

The reason indexing has become so prominent is because there is tremendous evidence proving that the market allocates capital better than more-active high-fee managers. The rise of indexing is consistent with the view that the market does not believe people like Bill Ackman know more about a corporation than the people who run that corporation. I find it rather odd that so many hedge fund managers believe they know more about corporations than the people who have spent their lives running and building those corporations.

Given that, some advisers are suggesting a new funding order for your retirement accounts. One could argue (savers) should fund their 401(k) up to employer's match, use any savings above the match amount to fund an HSA account and then use savings above that to fund a traditional or Roth IRA, or use for additional 401(k) contributions, said Rianka Dorsainvil, a certified financial planner and founder and president of Your Greatest Contribution. The latter contribution recommendation depends on the (saver's) income and whether from a tax strategy standpoint which vehicle would make the most sense for the (saver) to invest.

And this is my only forecast for the 10-year in 2017. If 2.60% is broken on the upside—if yields move higher than 2.60%—a secular bear bond market has begun. Watch the 2.6% level. Much more important than Dow 20,000. Much more important than $60-a-barrel oil. Much more important that the Dollar/Euro parity at 1.00.

Health care is one of the key components of retirement expenses, and is the only part of household expenditures that increase with age, Banerjee said in a release. While some of these costs are more predictable, others are uncertain, and for many people these expenses spike toward the end of life when resources are slim. To successfully manage your resources in retirement, a good plan may include separate preparations for each.

Trump Official: Medicaid Not Designed for Able-Bodied People
Medicare Parts A and B do not pay for all health care expenses. Coverage gaps include copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles. So you may want to buy a so-called Medigap policy, which is private supplemental insurance that's intended to cover some or all of the gaps. In most states, insurance companies can only sell standardized Medigap policies that offer the same basic benefits. Some Medigap policies offer additional benefits for an additional cost. Premiums vary depending on the plan you select.
Further, the data above showing index funds as a share of total assets in index funds proves that index funds don't control corporate America. They are, at best, still a minority participant. And more importantly, the rise of short-termism has coincided perfectly with the growth in activist hedge funds because most of these funds have time horizons that are much shorter than corporations would prefer. An asset manager literally cannot think long-term like a corporation because they are judged by their annual returns. Hedge funds will never have a truly long-term time horizon. They will necessarily do what is in the best interests of the short term because they must impose their short-term needs on firms. Perhaps this isn't true of Ackman's firm, but it is certainly true of active managers in general.

President-elect Joe Biden said in a news conference that the rioting bordered on sedition and called for Trump to go on national television to fulfill his oath and defend the Constitution and demand an end to this siege.
The hallmark of Trump's plan, which the Tax Foundation has estimated could cost as much as $6 trillion over the next decade in lost tax revenue, is lowering the number of tax brackets from seven to three: 12%, 25% and 33%. This would squeeze many taxpayers into a lower bracket than their current one, and some would move into a higher marginal tax bracket.

Housing, which has been a reluctant participant throughout this business cycle after overplaying its hand in the previous one, has peaked. Yet even at the high point for single-family housing starts earlier this year, builders were breaking ground on new homes at rates that paled in comparison to those of previous expansions over the last half century.
The downside? Paying for anything other than education costs will result in a penalty, so if your child isn't going to use the money for school it may make sense to transfer the account to a family member (or yourself) who will. Other college savings options include prepaid tuition plans, where parents lock in tuition payments at a slightly higher rate than current prices but likely lower rate than future prices, and Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, which can also be used for qualified elementary and secondary school expenses and is funded with after-tax dollars. One other risk is that college savings accounts in a child's name might hinder potential scholarships or financial aid, said Peggy Doviak, a financial adviser and principal of D.M. Wealth Management in Norman, Okla.

• Moderna Inc. MRNA, -5.43% expects its COVID-19 vaccine to provide immunity to the virus for at least a year, according to remarks made by a company executive at an investor conference on Monday, MarketWatch's Jaimy Lee reported. Moderna developed one of the two authorized COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. The company is tracking antibodies in participants in its Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials to better understand what level of antibodies are needed to be protected against infection with the coronavirus. Our expectation is that the vaccination should last you at least a year to the degree that you need a booster shot, the executive said. Separately, Moderna's vaccine was granted emergency use authorization in Switzerland, which has agreed to purchase 7.5 million doses. Ride-sharing company Uber said it will work with Moderna to find ways to support the update of COVID-19 vaccines.

So if you expect to pay lower tax rates during retirement (good luck with that), you might be better off making deductible traditional IRA contributions (assuming your income permits), because the current deductions may be worth more to you than tax-free withdrawals later on.
By contrast, the unfortunate decision by their creators to allow the value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to float versus the dollar opened the door for foolish speculation, and many gullible fools have rushed through that door. With no anchor, the price of bitcoin is whatever people are willing to pay — and what they are willing to pay today depends solely on what they think even bigger fools will be willing to pay tomorrow. When the bitcoin bubble pops, some speculators will be battered. So will the credibility of cryptocurrencies.

A 50% limit isn't easy to achieve, but it frees up money for wants (30%) and savings or debt repayment (20%). Sticking to a 50/30/20 budget also helps people better survive job loss and other economic setbacks by limiting their overhead. Having an emergency fund equal to three months' worth of must-have expenses is a good goal after you get on track with retirement savings and have paid off troublesome debt such as credit cards. Any loans may be affordable if the payments doesn't push your must-have expenses over the 50% mark.

Fifty-thousand would be about 3.5% of the market. But again, the true figure is less than that.

14. Have a fee-only financial planner undertake a comprehensive review of all of your various types of insurance—home, auto, umbrella, life, health (including Medicare Part C or D, Medigap), long-term care, etc. Most retirees tend to have too much for some types of insurance, and too little for other types—or, by not shopping around every couple of years, they are paying far too much relative to other, lower-cost policies.
Entering forbearance could wind up costing borrowers more in the long run both because interest capitalizes at the end of a forbearance period and because any time spent in forbearance delays progress towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which allows borrowers working in public service, including for the federal government, to have their loans forgiven after at least 10 years of payments.

Indeed, passive investors pay active investors in various forms (spreads, market-data fees, arbitrage, etc.) for owning their less-active product. Some active managers such as high-frequency trading firms and other market makers have made gobs of money during the rise of index funds due to the efficient way in which they make the indexing process operate. There is no clear distinction between active and passive investing because passive investing necessarily requires an active manager just like a market requires both a buyer and a seller.

For those looking to pay for their children's diplomas, one strategy is a 529 plan, a state-sponsored savings plan that comes with tax-free growth and distributions.

And while that might seem like a wide array of options, a few key sizes were missing.

If index funds control corporate America, then more of these high-fee active managers will stop pretending that they know more about corporations than the great entrepreneurs who built those businesses. But more importantly, the stock market is not the economy. Japan's economy is not suffering because there is a dearth of activist managers to help guide Japanese corporations to success. The Japanese economy is suffering primarily because they have an insurmountable demographic problem.

Under prior law, a partnership (or an LLC treated as a partnership for tax purposes) was terminated for federal income tax purposes if, within a 12-month period, there was a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the partnership's (LLC's) capital and profits interests. This so-called technical termination rule is generally unfavorable because: (1) it can require the filing of two short-period tax returns for the tax year in which the technical termination occurs, (2) it restarts the depreciation periods for the partnership's (LLC's) depreciable assets, and (3) it terminates favorable tax elections that were made by the partnership (LLC). Thankfully, the TCJA repeals the technical termination rule, effective for partnership (LLC) tax years beginning in 2018 and beyond.

Far-right extremism is also global, a point underscored by the 2011 massacre in Norway and the 2019 New Zealand mosque attack, both of which were perpetrated by people claiming to resist white genocide. The worldwide spread led the U.N. to recently issue a global alert about the growing and increasing transnational threat of right-wing extremism.
The idea here is that things that consumers spend a lot of money on have a bigger weight in the CPI. About one-third of consumer spending goes for owning or renting a home, so it follows that even a relatively modest 3.2% rise in rental prices is going to have a bigger impact on your wallet than, say, a 15% rise in fuel-oil prices (which accounts for about 0.1% of the typical consumer's budget).

Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc. CBRL, +0.55% shares were up 5.4% in Tuesday afternoon trading after the stock was upgraded to buy from neutral at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, which raised its price target to $151 from $149. Analysts increased their fiscal 2016 and 2017 earnings estimates to $7.66 and $8.50, respectively, based on boosts from falling egg prices and renewal of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which will lower the company's tax rate. SunTrust also raised its fiscal second quarter (ended January) 2016 same-store sales growth estimate to 1.5% from 0.3% based on the continued drop in gas prices, year-over-year comparisons that benefit from recent favorable weather conditions and same-store sales growth in Nov. and Dec. 2015. Analysts also believe there's potential for a share repurchase program or special dividend. Cracker Barrel shares are down 9.5% for the past three months versus the S&P 500, which is down 8.3%.

The other challenges include that cannabis companies need to be well-capitalized but are unable to access capital in the form of capital markets or bank loans. Cannabis is still illegal at the federal level, where it is classified as a Schedule I drug, putting it in the same class as heroin and cocaine. As long as the federal prohibition is in place, companies can't have bank accounts at federally insured institutions, and they can't sell product across state lines.

Your employer may allow you to transfer old 401(k) and IRA accounts into its plan, or you can consolidate them into one IRA. For simplicity, consider swapping individual stocks and bonds for professionally managed mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (but check with a tax pro before you sell any investments held outside retirement funds). Move scattered bank accounts under one roof, but keep in mind that FDIC insurance is generally limited to $250,000 per depositor per institution.
Boca Raton, Fla.–based ADT priced its IPO at $14 late Thursday, well below its targeted range of $17 to $19, to raise about $1.6 billion. Shares started trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ADT, and promptly fell 10.5%.

The vast majority of millennial workers (71%) said doing work that was meaningful to them was among the three most important factors determining career success, with 30% saying meaningful work was the single most important factor, according to a survey of 500 U.S. adults by DeVry University's Career Advisory Board conducted in 2011. And 27% said high pay was most important.

Memory lapses can lead to missed payments, late fees and credit score damage, which can in turn drive up the cost of borrowing and insurance. You can set up regular recurring payments in your bank's bill payment system, have other bills charged to a credit card and set up an automatic payment so the card balance is paid in full each month. Head off bounced-transaction fees with true overdraft protection, which taps a line of credit or a savings account to pay over-limit transactions.

In addition, since GE's North American Life and Health business is legally based in Kansas, it was that state's insurance regulator that had the last word on whether the business had enough capital to pay future claims. Capital reserves are calculated assuming moderately adverse conditions, rather than a more optimistic set of assumptions that can be used for financial statements prepared according to GAAP accounting standards.
The sector's tumble comes after it outperformed the broader market over the past few weeks, as upbeat employment data provided hopes of a strong holiday sales season.

But what might not be obvious is that you may not want to spend the same amount every year in retirement, and your spending now may bear little resemblance to what you'd actually spend in an ideal world in retirement.
There are a couple of competing explanations.
Health care can be a major challenge for early retirees, especially with no spouse who could have perhaps claimed you as a dependent on his or her plan. Health insurance can be expensive, especially when not tied to an employer's plan, and eventually, medical expenses will be a large portion of your monthly costs. This can be one of a retiree's biggest expenses and may compromise the reader's $3,000 monthly budget, said Brian Behl, founder of Behl Wealth.
Just as we looked to startups like Uber UBER, -4.23% and Facebook FB, +1.69% to revolutionize their industries, financial technology companies in blockchain are now mature enough to provide real alternatives. Services that can earn users up to 15% in interest a year. That isn't 24% owed to the banks for future income, that is your dollars earning for you — while you're at work, while you're asleep, and while you're focusing on your family or friends. The future of retirement is here and ready to help you be free.

The rebound has been attributed in part to a softer tone from the Federal Reserve when it comes to future rate increases, efforts by China to stimulate its economy, and a relative lack of negative news surrounding the U.S.-China trade spat. But analysts and others have begun to warn that the shutdown could begin to have a negative economic impact that poses to be a drag on the market.

Over the past 12 years, we've watched bitcoin's BTCUSD, +2.19% evolution from netherworld currency to major institutional commodity. In that time, it has fluctuated widely, introduced as a near-valueless currency in 2009, growing in value to $19,000+ nearly nine years later, then losing 76% of its market value within a year, before beginning a steady climb in the second half of 2020 that puts its value at more than $30,000.
Thus, reading the proverbial tarot cards visible nowadays in the fund world, here are my predictions for the coming year — the big fund stories I expect to make headlines in 2017:

But another argument goes like this. The HSA was designed to be an IRA for future health-care costs. And if that's how you plan to use it, consider doing the following: Estimate your future health care costs and then calculate how much you need to save and earn to reach that goal. In 2015, for instance, a 65-year-old couple needed $259,000 set aside in savings to fund (at the 90% confidence level) Medigap premiums, Medicare Part B premiums, and out-of-pocket drug expenses for retirement, according Employee Benefit Research Institute.

Employers may offer automatic enrollment or automatic increases to 401(k) plan contributions. The former takes money out of an employee's pay before tax and automatically places it into a 401(k) (usually around 3%), which qualify as elective deferrals. Employees can opt out of this, though it does ensure there's some money saved for retirement and has helped savers stash away maybe $29.6 billion for retirement.
The U.S. economy during the Coolidge administration was very successful, but the boom ended badly in 1929, just after Coolidge stepped down, with the stock market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression. During the 1930s, the 1920s were looked upon wistfully, but also as a time of fakery and cheating.

5. Equity indexed annuities continue to be marketed as a stock market alternative, when in fact they are an alternative to fixed income investments.

People in their 50s looking to retire sooner rather than later should also start mimicking their future lifestyle, by creating a financial plan or budget and spending less than they may currently be spending. That lifestyle should also be tested, to ensure they like it and can live within its means. By you being more disciplined on saving, it helps you be more disciplined on spending, Sotudeh said.

Others agree. Employees, who have access to several employer-sponsored accounts, need to decide how to best allocate their contributions, said Westley. How to prioritize savings will ultimately depend on an employee's personal situation as well as his or her goals for retirement.

Also, people often have unrealistically high expectations for rates of return in retirement. You may invest more conservatively and make a lower return once you are retired, said Watters. The more conservative you can be at this stage of your life, the better. When it comes to your planning options, it is better to find out now that you don't have enough saved and to work longer.
If the $200,000 in the taxable account is left to your heirs, it gets a step up in basis. When the inheritors sell, they will compare their proceeds to $200,000, not $100,000 so any gain should be minimal.
That said, for a little perspective, from the start of last year to Jan. 18, 2016, gold was only up about 2.8%, while the Dow and the S&P 500 were both off more than 8% during that period, according to FactSet data.

Take Huntsville, Ala., which had the most affordable rental market in the country back in January 2018, according to Attom Data Solutions. Last year, the average renter there only had to devote 22.3% of their wages to rent.

And the prevailing wages in places like Huntsville aren't as high as in cities like New York or Seattle.

Supervalu Inc. svu reported Wednesday fiscal third-quarter net income of $26 million, or 67 cents a share, compared with a loss of $26 million, or 69 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, such as merger and store closure charges and costs, adjusted earnings per share were 61 cents, beating the FactSet consensus of 46 cents. Adjusted EPS included a 30 cent discrete tax benefit. Revenue rose 31% to $3.94 billion, but fell shy of the FactSet consensus of $4.00 billion. Wholesale sales rose 52% to $2.89 billion, but was just below the FactSet consensus of $2.91 billion, while retail sales fell 4.1% to $1.02 billion, which was just below expectations of $1.04 billion. Same-store sales fell 3.5%, compared with the FactSet consensus for a 3.7% decline. The grocery store chain said it expects 2018 net earnings from continuing operations to a loss of $20 million to earnings of $2 million, which includes a charge of $35 million to $45 million to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets as a result of new tax legislation. The company had previously expected net earnings from continuing operations of $31 million to $50 million.

Which means that how much you need is based not just on how much you wish to spend, but on what sources that income comes from, and how much income those sources generate. If your spending target in retirement is $50,000 a year, that could come from $1,250,000 in invested assets (if you trust the 4% rule, or $1.6 million with 3%, or somewhere in between) that you sell off a little at a time. It could come from collecting enough rent to clear $50,000 after expenses. It could come from dividends alone on $2.5 million worth of stocks (assuming an average 2% yield — though I know dividend investors aim for better than that).

Strong global demand: Aside from the charts and asset rotation, there is structural demand that will provide a lift for gold. For starters, look at India, where gold imports surged an amazing 67% in 2017. The nation is the No. 2 consumer gold market in the world behind China, so that's an encouraging sign of retail demand. As for China, demand for gold bars through November was up 40% from a year earlier, according to gold portal Kitco. That speaks to strong momentum.
Beyond paying off their full card balance each month, consumers can achieve this by applying for a balance-transfer credit card with a 0% interest introductory offer. These cards give consumers a chance to pay off their debts without digging themselves into a hole via interest payments.

An individual cannot retire on $1 million if they plan to keep 70% of their funds in low-interest (no interest nowadays) accounts, said Thomas Balcom, founder of 1650 Wealth Management, who recommends having 20% to 25% in bond funds or cash positions and the remainder in a diversified portfolio of stock mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and/or market linked notes. These investments will provide him with the potential to grow his portfolio to account for inflation during his retirement years.
It's going to be necessary to have some national leadership on the issue, Allison said.

For example, millennial drivers living with their parents typically pay far higher annual premiums ($1,750) versus other demographics, a Compare.com study determined.

The credit begins phasing out for a particular manufacturer over four calendar quarters once the total number of qualifying vehicles sold by that manufacturer for use in the U.S. reaches 200,000. The IRS recently announced that Tesla had sold more than qualifying vehicles through the third quarter of 2018. So the phase-out rule is triggered for Tesla vehicles effective 1/1/19.
Premiums for all of the aforementioned Medicare health insurance coverages can be combined with your other qualifying health care expenses for purposes of claiming an itemized deduction for medical expenses on your Form 1040.

The day's gain came despite ongoing geopolitical uncertainty. Iran was in focus after nine people were reported dead after overnight clashes between protesters and security forces. The protests started last week over rising inflation and corruption, but focus has since shifted to a wider discontent with Iran's ruling system and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The wave of unrest is now seen as the largest since a disputed 2009 presidential election, and it could filter into markets if it results in any kind of disruption to the region's oil industry.

As you might know, I've been on a bit of a kick with benchmarks, as I've tried to explain some of the confusion between active and passive investing. In my mind, there is really only one global benchmark and anyone who deviates from the Global Financial Asset Portfolio is therefore engaging in active investing. We are all essentially asset pickers inside of this one aggregate portfolio. Knowing what an index actually is — and how arbitrary the term is — can be a good starting point for understanding what I am ranting about.
The quickest way to get a significant sum into a Roth IRA is by converting a traditional IRA to Roth status. The conversion is treated as a taxable distribution from your traditional IRA, because you're deemed to receive a payout from the traditional account with the money then going into the new Roth account. So doing a conversion before year-end will trigger a bigger federal income tax bill for this year (and maybe a bigger state income tax bill too).

Such a deal would be comparable with Verizon Communications Inc.'s takeover of AOL, and would give a buyer a stake in Yahoo's ad technology, mobile research capabilities, digital content, such as video, and treasure trove of patents.

Republicans may also feel more pressure to pass bills to expand Social Security, especially if they are up for reelection in the coming years, Richtman said. It is more about momentum to get Republicans to join and have these issues become more visible, he said. There's certainly a better chance than before the 50-50 split.
The other lesson, according to Landis: Changes, when they eventually do get enacted, are likely to be incremental rather than drastic. That's because draconian changes are not necessary in order to keep Social Security solvent.

And I would put financial conditions – that is not a goal of monetary policy – but it makes it harder to start tightening if you have to do a lot of tightening, and if you really have to slow down the economy. If you think that potential GDP is growing around 1.75%, well if you want to get the unemployment rate to gradually go up, you are going to have to be seeing some 1.5% [GDP prints] and some lower numbers than we've been seeing. When we see those numbers it is possible that you get more of a slowdown than you're anticipating, and that can be particularly true, I think, if financial markets are a little bit too ebullient. So I think financial conditions and financial stability issues complement some of the concerns I would have about whether we're getting to an unsustainable level of unemployment rate over time.

Higher volume and design improvements are crucial for Tesla to be able to sell the standard interior Model 3 at $35,000 as pledged and still be a viable company, he said. So far, the least-expensive version starts at $44,000 after Tesla lowered prices of all of its vehicles by $2,000 in early January. The federal tax credit that phases out this year, its expiration raising the ire of Musk, had helped make up the gap.

In addition to general volatility on Wall Street, there were lots of fireworks around its Model 3 launch, an SEC lawsuit against Elon Musk and a host of other shenanigans in 2018. Though this is encouraging to some, I expect that to continue in 2019 as continued competition from legacy auto makers makes growth harder for Tesla, and generally cheap gas prices and weak auto sales in the U.S. keep the electric-vehicle revolution from really hitting top gear.

9. About 90% of investment products have fees and costs which are too high. The academic research in this area, stretching back for decades now, is compelling—higher fees are almost certainly going to lead to lower returns over the long run. Consider a racehorse in the Kentucky Derby. All of the horses racing must carry the same weight—jockey, tack, and (when necessary to equalize things out) some small weights in the saddlebag. If a horse carries more weight (similar, for example, to investments with higher fees), the horse still might manage some smart strategy and win a short race, but for longer races the extra weight is definitely going to slow that horse down. By far the largest single factor affecting investor returns in mutual funds, variable annuities, ETFs and other pooled investment vehicles are the fees and costs incurred. Low-cost products will highly likely possess higher returns over the long run, and just a small difference in returns can add up over a long retirement.
Here are returns since the end of the third quarter:
As a consequence of these regulatory and infrastructure developments, Wall Street has turned bullish on bitcoin.

If the current bitcoin price is higher than the price you originally paid, then you would have to pay extra tax on the now realized gain from the bitcoin payment. However, if the current bitcoin price is lower than your basis price, then it amounts to realizing a loss on the bitcoin, which can be offset against your total tax bill and reduce it.

In my interview with him, Landis started by reviewing the amendments to Social Security that were enacted in 1983, which is the last time that changes were enacted. He pointed out that the Social Security trust fund was slated to run out of money in July of that year, and the changes that averted that possibility weren't enacted until March—with just four months to spare, in other words. Landis characterized the changes as gentle, phased in, and targeted in the future. They included the gradual increase in the full retirement age and an acceleration of a previously-enacted payroll tax increase; in addition, up to one-half of the value of Social Security benefits were made potentially taxable.

Grant named five closed-end funds that each have more than 85% of assets invested in natural gas pipeline limited partnerships. The closed-end funds have advantages over open-end mutual funds. For one thing, managers do not have to worry about investing new money coming in if the timing is unfavorable, as new shares are not created. Close-end funds can also make life simpler for investors at tax time, as they issue 1099 forms, rather than the partnerships' Schedule K-1 tax forms.
Some advisers suggest funding the HSA last, but for different reasons. Since the HSA can only be used for medical expenses, we typically see it as the third priority, said Adams Belew. And it is important not to forget that saving to these accounts also often has to be balanced with saving for other priorities… Unfortunately, the answer is never simple.

Sales of recreational cannabis — which is legal in Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia — grew 184% year over year, from $351 million in 2014 to $998 million in 2015, according to a report by cannabis analytics firm New Frontier and Arcview Market Research. The report estimates that the recreational and medical industry is worth about $5.4 billion — up from $4.6 billion in 2014 — and will continue to grow by 30% annually. Oregon, Alaska and Washington, D.C. were the most recent states to legalize recreational cannabis during the November 2014 elections.
There's light at the end of this tunnel. Saying no gives you the bandwidth to start building your criteria for yes projects: lost passions or hobbies like art or music, activities that jazz you such as tuning into nature, or things that will be important to you later in life, such as downsizing your possessions so that you can someday move to your dream destination.
Many Democrats in Congress recognize China's criminal behavior is a menace to American prosperity and security. A steady, private dialogue that links their support for congressional approval of the new North American free trade deal to Trump trading in his spray gun for a more focused trade rifle would help broaden their party's appeal to working-class voters.
Analysts expect slower economic growth in the U.S. in 2019 in great part because sales and especially earnings received a tremendous boost from the dramatic cut in federal corporate income-tax rates. Sales for S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% companies are expected by analysts to increase by 5.3% in 2019 and again in 2020, slowing from 9.3% in 2018.
Early in my life, Munger taught me that trying to get rich fast is dangerous. One has to gamble on the short-term price swings of some stock, derivatives contract, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% , the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% or other asset. A huge number of people are trying to do the same thing, many of them who are much better informed than I am, and the short-term price movement of any stock or derivative contract is subject to all kinds of wild price gyrations due to events that have nothing to do with the actual long-term value of the underlying business. And last, but not least, there is the problem of leverage — to get rich quickly one often has to use leverage/debt to amplify small price swings into really huge gains. If things go against us, can also turn into really large loses.

Ocasio-Cortez suggests marginal income-tax rates as high as 70%
If selling some losers would cause your 2020 capital losses to exceed your 2020 capital gains, the result would be a net capital loss for the year. No problem. That net capital loss can be used to shelter up to $3,000 of 2020 income from salaries, bonuses, self-employment income, interest income, royalties, and whatever else ($1,500 if you use married filing separate status). Any excess net capital loss is carried forward to next year and beyond.

Closed-end funds can borrow to invest more and generate more income. This fund is 34.6% leveraged. Open-end mutual funds quote net asset values (NAV) as share prices, as investors can only buy or sell shares at the end of each trading day. The NAV is a fund's total assets divided by the number of shares. But a closed-end fund is publicly traded, so its share price can trade at a premium or discount to NAV. The Center Coast MLP & Infrastructure Fund traded at a slight premium (0.47%) to NAV at the close Jan. 9.

To the extent you have capital losses this year or capital loss carryovers from earlier years, selling winners by year-end will not result in any tax hit. In particular, sheltering net short-term capital gains with capital losses is a tax-smart move because net short-terms gains will otherwise be taxed at your higher ordinary income rate of up to 37%, plus another 3.8% if the NIIT bites. Ouch.

The U.S. has long been an area of rising focus for Alibaba, particularly as the Hangzhou-headquartered company's stock continues to trade 20% below an all-time high reached more than two years ago. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed published on June 15, 2015, a week before Trump announced his candidacy for the presidency, Ma said Alibaba was focusing on the U.S. market, and he said helping U.S. brands connect to Chinese consumers would create American jobs and increase U.S. exports. Alibaba also specifically chose the U.S., rather than its home base of China, for its initial public offering.

Exchange-traded notes are a cousin to exchange-traded funds, but they are not the same and their different structure comes with inherent, problematic flaws.

The new 355 ml size is particularly important, Kaiser said, because it is the size of a standard 12 ounce can of soda or beer. Although a 355 ml can might not look very different from a 375 ml can on the shelves at the liquor store, they're much easier to source. That 355 ml size was the most requested standard of fill by wineries, so Kaiser said including it in the new regulations is a win.

Some 50-somethings may want to start by evaluating what they already have saved, according to New York-based robo-adviser Betterment. This includes looking over what accounts you already have (and possibly consolidate numerous accounts) and checking your portfolios' asset allocations. General advice is to lean toward bonds instead of stocks as you get older, since they're less risky, but some experts, such as Henry Hebeler, who assists people with retirement planning, might suggest keeping a fair mix as that money will need to stretch through your retirement years. Keep in mind, how you feel about the risk associated with your portfolio are also important in determining the right mix.
While I was paying off my student loans, my husband was also paying off his own debt.

It does not call to demand immediate payment using a prepaid debit card, gift card or wire transfer, nor does it threaten to bring in local police or immigration officers. The IRS also cannot revoke your driver's license, business licenses, or immigration status. Threats like these are common tactics scam artists use to trick victims into buying into their schemes, according to the IRS.
However, 20 states and the District of Columbia impose their own death or inheritance taxes. Some kick in at much lower wealth levels, and they can be expensive. For example, the New Jersey death tax currently hits estates worth over $2 million, and Washington state's estate tax is a whopping 20% on the excess of an estate's value over the 2017 exemption of $2.079 million. Bottom line: you may need to make some estate-tax-reduction moves after all, just because of where you live.

For example, an online illustrator indicates a 65-year-old male that buys an immediate annuity for $100,000 can get a monthly payment of $565 until his death. Versions that would make any payments beyond his death payout less. So $565 a month equates to 6.78% a year of his investment but he is not getting anywhere near 6.78% in interest or earnings. He doesn't net any investment return until he gets back $100,000 in payments which will take until he reaches age 79 and nine months. If he dies before this time, his internal rate of return (IRR) will be negative.

Instead, that turnaround is being signaled by where those recent sessions have left shares.

Excluding non-recurring items, such as $22.1 million in tax expenses, adjusted earnings per share rose to 35 cents from 31 cents, matching the FactSet consensus of 35 cents. Sales rose to $1.28 billion from $1.08 billion, but was just below the FactSet consensus of $1.29 billion, as an increase in Americas fabrication sales offset declined in recycling and mills sales. Results for the first quarter were strong even though we experienced historically wet weather in the U.S. which reduced shipments, said Chief Executive Barbara Smith. The stock has shed 15.1% over the past three months through Friday, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% has lost 12.3%.
Sirius XM Holdings Inc. SIRI, +1.28% ticked lower in the extended session Tuesday after the satellite radio company issued forecasts for this year and the next. Sirius shares declined 0.9% after hours, following a 2.1% gain to close at $6.35 a share Tuesday. The company said it expects to meet or exceed its 2018 guidance for revenue, free cash flow, and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. In late October, Sirius forecast self-pay net subscriber additions of about 1.28 million for the year, revenue of about $5.73 billion, adjusted EBITDA of about $2.2 billion, and free cash flow of about $1.5 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet estimate self-pay net subscriber additions of 1.32 million, revenue of $5.75 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $2.17 billion, and free cash flow of $1.53 billion. For 2019, Sirius XM said it expects self-pay net additions approaching 1 million, revenue of about $6.1 billion, adjusted EBITDA of about $2.3 billion, and free cash flow of about $1.6 billion. Analysts expect self-pay net additions of 1.1 million, revenue of $6.07 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $2.35 billion, and free cash flow of $1.69 billion. The company said its guidance does not include the effect of its expected acquisition of Pandora Media Inc. p in the first quarter. Sirius is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Jan. 30.

The ongoing shutdown has been sparked by a dispute over money for President Donald Trump's proposed wall at the Mexican border. The president on Wednesday left a negotiating session after clashing with top Democratic lawmakers, and Trump stated Thursday that he could declare a national emergency in order to build his wall if there's no deal with Democrats, saying probably I will do it. I would almost say definitely. Analysts have noted the impact of the current shutdown is somewhat limited, because it's only affecting agencies that represent about 25% of total government spending.

To be profitable, banks need a bigger spread between short-term interest rates — what they pay for deposits — and long-term rates, which they receive for lending. Rates — and the spread between them — became depressed in the wake of the financial crisis. When the yield curve steepens, it's because investors expect faster growth and stronger inflation.

It's a good bet that most of Donald Trump's news conference Wednesday will focus on that dossier of unverified allegations surrounding ties to Russia that the president-elect has dismissed as a total political witch hunt.
That includes potentially using reconciliation to advance critical priorities for American families, he said.
A letter released after the president-elect's news conference on Wednesday sought to explain the President-elect's plan in more detail. It says that foreign governments' business at a Trump International Hotel or similar business is not a present, Emolument, Office, or Title. Therefore, business from foreign governments and their dignitaries is not a 'present' or 'emolument' as long they are receiving fair value for their money.

Tiffany & Co.'s tif price target was bumped up to $108 from $96 at Wells Fargo after the luxury jeweler announced plans to reinvest its tax reform savings in the business. Analysts maintained their market perform stock rating. Tiffany shares are up 2.1% in Wednesday trading. What's most interesting about this is that Tiffany is essentially saying that they plan to reinvest all of their upcoming tax upside (which we estimate to be 35-to-40 cents) back into the business - a prudent move given their need to invest more heavily in sales driving initiatives, the Wells Fargo note says. During Wednesday's premarket, Tiffany announced its holiday sales figures and said it would take a $115 million-to-$165 million charge for the quarter ending Jan. 31, 2018 to reevaluate deferred tax assets and repatriation tax on foreign earnings. For fiscal 2018, Tiffany anticipates increased levels of spending in a number of areas, including technology, marketing communications, visual merchandising, digital and store presentations, the release said. Wells Fargo analysts believe this strategy could be a positive in the long term as Tiffany's top-line performance has been choppy for the past few years, potentially requiring significant investment to reinvigorate growth. Tiffany shares are up 37.4% for the past year, outpacing the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% , which is up 23.3% for the period.

Major proposals by the Biden campaign would raise $1.6 trillion to $1.9 trillion over a decade from corporations, $1 trillion to $1.2 trillion from high earners through the income tax, and $800 billion to $1 trillion from Social Security payroll taxes on high-wage earners. Biden also supports a fee on banks, which we believe will raise $100 billion, tax credits for renters and first-time homebuyers that we estimate will cost $300 billion, and an increase of the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, which we estimate will cost $100 billion.
Traditional 401(k) plans are employer-sponsored accounts that allow employees to save pre-tax dollars from their wages for retirement. A Roth 401(k) is also employer-sponsored, but contributions are invested with after-tax dollars and withdrawals are not subject to federal income tax (so long as you're 59 ½ years old and have had the account five years).
Here are four reasons why it's a good idea to think about leaving some assets to causes that are meaningful to you:
Munger made it clear to me that sometimes the shortsighted stock market serves up an investment opportunity that is so obvious it is hard not to trip over it. This usually happens when investors are panicking and fleeing any and all investments, even the ones with great long-term economics. This flight is the draining of the barrel: Stock prices sink, which makes it easier for Munger to see the fish, in this case underpriced great businesses.
Key Point: If you are self-employed or an S corporation shareholder-employee, you can claim an above-the-line deduction for your health insurance premiums — including Medicare premiums. And you don't need to itemize to get the tax-savings.
To return to the refrain: sequencing and pacing matter. It would have made more sense to begin with creating new jobs before the old jobs were destroyed, to ensure that the profits of the oil and coal companies were taxed, and the hidden subsidies they receive eliminated, before asking those who are barely getting by to pony up more.
Overall, we find states are increasingly diverging from CDC guidance and from each other, suggesting that access to COVID-19 vaccines in these first months of the U.S. vaccine campaign may depend a great deal on where one lives, the analysis found. In addition, timelines vary significantly across states, regardless of priority group, resulting in a vaccine rollout labyrinth across the country.
While we have made great progress, our products are still too expensive for most people, he wrote. Tesla has only been producing cars for about a decade and we're up against massive, entrenched competitors. The net effect is that Tesla must work much harder than other manufacturers to survive while building affordable, sustainable products.
Biden's tax plan includes the provision of applying taxes to earnings above $400,000. In his campaign, the president-elect also suggested there be a minimum benefit, so that beneficiaries who have worked 30 years get no less than 125% of the federal poverty level.
You can get your Medicare benefits from the government through Part A and Part B coverage or through a so-called Medicare Advantage plan offered by a private insurance company. Medicare Advantage plans are sometimes called Medicare Part C.

How to potentially get a 30% return in three months with the 'January Effect'
Cryptocurrencies can't compete: Lest you think the crypto craze sapped demand for gold, it's important to remember that the nice appreciation for the precious metal in 2017 came even amid bitcoin's big run. This shows resilience even as other alternative assets gain investor attention. Furthermore, even after the Cboe launched bitcoin futures in late 2017, Goldman Sachs reported no discernible outflow of gold as traders and institutional investors were given another fashionable way to play the crypto market. Gold is a haven for a reason, and no fashionable asset craze can change that.

While some very fortunate people have turned their hobbies into six-figure careers, as MarketWatch previously reported, most people use them to supplement their income.

The whole concept is to get the cash, so if the market goes down, you have cash to reinvest, Grant said. If you play for appreciation and you are down, then you are stuck. This way, if you are down, you have cash coming in every month or every quarter, that you can reinvest at lower prices, and theoretically, if the companies don't cut their dividends, at higher yields, he added.
Almost all of the Democratic candidates in the 2016 presidential election included some provision that would make tuition at public colleges free or debt-free.

To be sure, predicting what will come out of Congress in the next few months is an inexact science at best, much less the next 15 years. But if anyone can gauge Social Security's real-world prospects, it should be Andy Landis, author of Social Security: The Inside Story. Landis, for those of you who don't know him, is a former Social Security Administration representative who has several decades of experience explaining the intricacies of Social Security to retirees and soon-to-be-retirees.

So there is a need for a baseline regulatory framework, as well as oversight, that legitimizes crypto-assets.

For example, one can potentially benefit from a Roth IRA conversion by delaying required distributions, thereby enabling his or her retirement savings to enjoy extended tax shelter. Another potential way for one to benefit from a Roth conversion is when it is likely that the tax rate paid at the time of conversion will be less than the tax rate that would be paid at some point in the future (either by the IRA holder or his/her beneficiaries).
Raising kids is expensive. The average cost of raising a child is $233,610 for a child born in 2015 through age 17, according to a recent report from the United States Department of Agriculture. (It's significantly more if you're a high-earner). When a second child is welcomed into the family, the costs continue to pile up: hand-me-downs are nice, but parents will likely need to expand their living spaces, update their cars, save for college (again) and pay for promises, like summer camp sessions and soccer league.

Transactions are a flow, like the number of cars sold between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017. There is no fixed relationship between the two. The number of cars sold during a year does not determine how much money must be outstanding at any point during the year, or vice versa, because the money can be spent over and over during the year.
But what if investment returns are up at a gaudy 15%, like they were in recent years? That unlikely figure probably has a lot to do with the increasing popularity of FIRE, particularly among millennials, who haven't suffered through previous bear markets.

Catching up doesn't have to be overwhelming — whether you have kids or not, expenses can be downsized, which would allow the average 50-something to put more money away for their retirement. Some people choose to move to a smaller home, or rent, to alleviate paying off a mortgage for a home too large and perhaps not fully used. Buying a smaller home could also save on taxes, utility costs and insurance, according to business forecasts publishing company Kiplinger.
• Convert a traditional IRA into a Roth account. A conversion is treated as a taxable distribution from the traditional account with the money going into the new Roth account. So it will trigger a bigger federal income tax bill (and maybe a bigger state income tax bill too). However, the two positive factors mentioned earlier may greatly outweigh the one-time tax hit. And if the Trump tax plan becomes reality, the tax hit may be lower than in previous years. You don't need any earned income to do a Roth conversion, and there's no income restriction either. So even retired billionaires can do Roth conversions.

L Brands Inc. LB, -1.57% shares rose 2% in Tuesday premarket trading after it was upgraded to outperform from neutral at Baird Equity Research on the company's 2018 earnings-per-share growth potential. Baird raised its price target to $70 from $60. Analysts led by Mark Altschwager think the Victoria's Secret brand is turning a corner under new leadership and there's steady momentum at Bath & Body Works. Baird expects Victoria's Secret to exceed December same-store sales and fourth-quarter EPS expectations thanks to solid traffic and sales. Recent tax reforms should be a tailwind. And Baird is bullish about the company's store strategy, which includes selective expansion of Victoria's Secret square footage in order to grow core categories. Analysts note that the majority of stores don't carry the full lingerie or popular Pink collections. L Brands shares are down 8.5% for the last year while the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% is up 19.4% for the period.
Investing Insights: A global markets survival guide
As investors approach this transition from saving to spending they should take three steps: start with a retirement income plan, keep their portfolio invested and diversified, and then rebalance their portfolio periodically to generate the cash they require. Here we'll discuss the last step — creating your paycheck when rebalancing.
Advisers do emphasize the need to diversify your retirement accounts. Why so? Having money in all three types of retirement accounts gives you the best chance of creating tax-efficient income in retirement. We do like to see tax diversification, meaning having money in both tax-deferred (traditional 401(k)) and tax-free (Roth 401(k)) vehicles, said Adams Below. This helps provide for better tax planning during the withdrawal mode, and it helps with the risk of legislative changes related to how those accounts are taxed.
Because it doesn't carry a yield, gold is considered a hedge against inflation, and typically outperforms when interest rates are low and prices of consumer goods are stagnant.
Find your why. Focusing on your financial and life goals can keep you motivated to pay off your debt over the long term.
While these best-case scenarios might not seem feasible right now, don't wait to start saving until you can set aside the amount you feel you're supposed to, says Emily Guy Birken, author of End Financial Stress Now. For instance, save even 1% of your income for retirement if that's all you can afford. Increase the amount by 1% every six months as you get accustomed to having less in your paycheck — or at least whenever you get a raise.
KB Home KBH, -4.29% said Thursday it had net income of $44 million, or 43 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, down from $852.8 million, or $8.36 a share, in the year-earlier period, which was boosted by a tax gain. Revenue rose 24% to $985.8 million. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of 50 cents and revenue of $1.068 billion. While inclement weather and trade shortages in certain markets tempered our fourth-quarter deliveries and revenues, we have a positive rhythm in our business and substantial momentum as we enter 2016, Chief Executive Jeffrey Mezger said in a statement. The company had a backlog of $1.28 billion at the end of the quarter, up 40% from the year earlier. The number of homes in backlog rose 36% to 3,966.

There was talk of drastically changing 401(k) plans late last year, before the tax bill was passed. Reports suggested the contribution limit would be dropped to $2,400 per year, or somewhere between there and the then-current limit of $18,000. Others thought Congress might Rothify these accounts, by taxing contributions before investing them. Traditional 401(k) plans are tax-deferred, which means they're taxed at withdrawal. The new tax bill ended up not including either of these ideas, but still affects retirement savers and retirees, such as stopping recharacterizations of individual retirement accounts (which allow savers to undo decisions to rollover or convert accounts to Roth IRAs) or inspiring some to move to another state.
Here's what you can do to ease the pain of divorcehood:
Some numbers matter more than others. How much you make is important, for example, but your financial health depends far more on how much you keep.

Estimize, which crowdsources estimates from buy-side and sell-side analysts, hedge-fund managers, academics and others, is expecting a higher number of $1.47 a share.
Interest rates rose last year and are expected to keep increasing in 2019, making buying a home with a mortgage less affordable for many — even younger Americans who aim to pay off their home in 20 or 30 years and reap the appreciation of a rise in home values. And despite a slight drop in demand in some housing markets, tight housing inventory across the country is still fueling competition for homes and consequently making them more expensive.

My advice is to examine why he wants to retire, Haas said. Maybe there is something he always wanted to do that is different from his current job.

Many investors had not heard of yy.com because it targets young users and its business model was unique, said Lee, who led the firm's $7.9 million investment in the startup. Many investors couldn't understand it. The company was valued at less than $70 million when we invested in it, but now its valuation is more than $3 billion. The investment has grown nearly 40 times.
Question: My wife and I are both 70 and about to deal with required minimum distributions. We are in the 25% (or maybe 28% this year) tax bracket and our 401(k) and IRA assets are in the $1.2 million range. All are pretax contributions. We are both fortunate enough to have pensions, in addition to Social Security, which we live off. At this point, we don't need the money from our 401(k) and IRAs to live on. We are about to get clobbered over the next years with higher taxes due to required minimum distributions. Is your view that a good strategy may be to convert part of our 401(k) and IRAs to Roth IRAs and take a tax hit now to avoid future RMD tax consequences? And, if so, how much would you recommend we convert this year and then future years? —B.V.

People are chosen for audits when an IRS software program randomly selects the taxpayer or when that person is linked to someone else, like a family member or business partner, being audited.

Though Michael Kors saw some success with its new All Access smartwatches, handbags underwhelmed, particularly at wholesale, from a conversion perspective, analysts said.
Most Americans say they want to age in place, or remain in their current home as they get older. But homes age as well, and the repair bills tend to increase as they do. A home inspection before you retire could alert you to looming problems and give you some idea of the costs you can expect. (Home inspections typically range from $278 to $391, according to contractor matching site HomeAdvisor.)
In the example we've shared here before, which uses imaginary numbers, we show the type of projection that our plan is based on. It's nowhere near as simple as a 4% rule calculation, but it takes into account multiple factors like when our rental income kicks in, when we can switch over to tax-deferred accounts (401(k)s that are soon to be converted to IRAs), different withdrawal levels in each phase (more spending in later years), and what we can expect to have at different rates of return.

If you're not carrying balances or heavily using any of your cards, you can close several at a time. Otherwise, close them gradually over several months or even years to minimize the credit score impact, and consider keeping your highest-limit cards.

Whether it be the ties of blood on my mother's side, or the friendships I have developed here over many years of active life, or the commanding sentiment of comradeship in the common cause of great peoples who speak the same language, who kneel at the same altars and, to a very large extent, pursue the same ideals, I cannot feel myself a stranger here in the center and at the summit of the United States. I feel a sense of unity and fraternal association which, added to the kindliness of your welcome, convinces me that I have a right to sit at your fireside and share your Christmas joys.
L Brands Inc. reported of $2.52 billion for the five weeks ending Dec. 30, up from $2.44 billion last year. Same-store sales were up 1% for the period.
Investors are increasingly skeptical of President-elect Donald Trump's plans to enact pro-growth economic policies, according to a proprietary gauge of investor sentiment compiled by Citigroup Inc.
Trump has never been clear and consistent about what he will do as president. Tax cuts are clearly on his agenda, and the stimulus could lead to higher asset prices. Lower corporate taxes are naturally supposed to lead to higher share prices, while cuts in personal income tax might lead to higher home prices (though possibly offset by other changes in the tax system).
Updating and backing up the device regularly.
For millennials — those born 1981 through 1997 — the opposite may be true, Barbera said. They should start with the Roth 401(k) and slowly move to the traditional as their income increases and the need for a deduction increases, he said. It could be a situation where they move 20% every three to five years from Roth to traditional.
Hoping you choose to spend against your future earnings is what banks and credit card companies would like you to do, but this year has proven that borrowing from the future is unpredictable. When banks get you to borrow from your future self at 24% interest, they are grabbing someone else's dollars on which they pay them 0.1% to let you have instant gratification and spend now what you cannot afford otherwise.
A $20-billion-plus stock is taken private. It's the perfect storm for a megadeal: Valuations have backed down a bit, interest rates are still relatively low and corporate tax cuts have left firms with billions in more cash to deploy. Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B, -1.22% BRK.A, -0.95% already has plenty of history in making big deals, including the 2013 one with 3G Capital to take Heinz private for $23 billion or the 2009 deal to snap up railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe for $27 billion. It's hard to deal with low growth rates amid public pressures, but plenty of smallish large-cap stocks could make very attractive plays over the medium- or long-term for someone with deep enough pockets to take them private.
The bank was unusual among many American companies in recording a one-time benefit from the tax law, because it had a deferred tax liability, rather than a deferred tax asset. The bank said its effective tax rate in 2018 would be 19%, a meaningful decline, according to Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders.
On Monday, Alibaba BABA, +1.32% Chief Executive Jack Ma became, after a 40-minute meeting with Trump in the newly minted politician's gold-plated tower, the most recent CEO to tout job creation. There's no better music to President-elect Donald Trump's ears than pledges from CEOs to keep jobs in the U.S. or to create new ones. Trump based much of his campaign on ensuring U.S. jobs are kept away from foreigners and aren't outsourced to other countries, and he's gone to great and highly publicized lengths to prove his election is the reason for jobs coming to or staying in America.
In 2005, GGV set up a team to focus on China-related investments. The company picked Lee, who had worked for Singapore-based VC JAFCO Asia, and Foo, an early investor in Baidu, to run its China operation based in Shanghai.

Boston College's Center for Retirement Research found that most people world-wide are what you'd call passive savers or people who pay little attention to tax incentives currently given by traditional financial policies. Instead, they adapt and adjust their spending to their take-home pay. This mentality makes the idea of saving and earning more responsive to initiatives like auto-enrolment.

Data showed the U.S. lost 140,000 jobs in December, the first decline in eight months as the COVID-19 pandemic bore down on the economy. The jobless rate was unchanged at 6.7%.
That has led to frustrated investors moving away from the traditional diversified portfolio to a factor-investing approach, which typically means they are pursuing whatever has worked lately.
In a divided Congress, oversight could cast a discerning focus on monopoly exploitation to coax a reluctant Justice Department to start prosecuting abusers. Together, the two parties need to fashion legislation that requires drug companies, hospitals, insurers and medical professionals to benchmark prices against those fetched in prosperous northern European countries with insurance-based payments systems.
Trendowski said many cases settle. I really believe a jury doesn't want to hear about drunk driving. They just don't want to hear about the drunk driver and they don't want to hear about the bar, she said.
Such offers during the shutdown make sense, given that many studies have shown Americans often have low levels of savings. Big banks including Wells Fargo WFC, -0.88% and Bank of America BAC, -0.29% are not making similar loans to affected government workers, a New York Times report noted, though some are waiving overdraft and monthly service fees. Pro baseball is getting involved, as the Washington Nationals said affected season ticket holders could postpone monthly payments for tickets.
News of Dr. Martens' planned flotation will raise hopes of a revival in the European IPO market, which has lagged behind the record-breaking run of technology IPOs in the U.S. last year. In December, shares in food-delivery startup DoorDash DASH, +0.10% and home-rental company Airbnb ABNB, +0.67% soared as much as 115% on their first day of trading in New York.
The number of confirmed global cases of the coronavirus-borne illness COVID-19 climbed above 91 million on Tuesday, and the U.S. case tally headed toward 23 million, as three Democratic lawmakers who were forced to shelter in place during last week's attack on the Capitol tested positive for the virus.
The credit can be used to offset your regular federal income tax liability and any alternative minimum tax (AMT) that you owe. Since there are no income restrictions, even billionaires can qualify. However, if the credit exceeds your federal income tax liability, you cannot carry the excess forward for use in future years.
Ignoring that first problem, at least for now, I'm going to propose seven steps you can take that will actually make a difference.

The rioting mob are expected to have created a separate superspreader event as most of the people who were televised roaming around the corridors were not wearing face masks, as Dr. Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told McClatchy.
The thought process is worth covering because while you aren't winning this lottery (again), work may someday give you the same choice as the winner on whether to take a lump-sum payment or go with long-term distribution of money you've earned.
The pre-election Biden tax plan would raise the top individual federal income rate on ordinary income and net short-term capital gains back to 39.6%, the top rate that was in effect before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) lowered it to 37% for 2018-2025. Biden also said he would generally raise taxes on folks with incomes above $400,000 without supplying specifics.
Some commentators, most notably Professor Richard Painter of the University of Minnesota Law School, Norm Eisen of the Brookings Institution, and Professor Larry Tribe of Harvard Law argued recently in an article in The Atlantic magazine for a much broader definition of emolument to cover anything of value.
With the world's two largest economies leading a slowdown in global growth, we suspect that the recent bounce in stock markets will fizzle out, with most around the world ending the year lower, he said.
Without enough cash to foot the bill, people often turn to credit cards or tap retirement accounts. In a 2017 PwC survey, one in five boomers said they'd had to withdraw money from their plans before retirement and a third anticipated having to do so in the future, most commonly to help manage an unexpected expense.
If you put money away into an asset that is not linked to the USD or your local FIAT currency it will grow faster than inflation, if it also pays interest income on 35 different digital assets, such interest rates can be greater than inflation and get you closer and closer to financial independence each month. Add on top of that compounding interest and you have the trifecta of how to reach retirement. So here you are, we gave you the secret but unless you press the financial launch button nothing happens, you need to take action and put yourself on the right track for retirement.

Again, these aren't our real numbers, but in our actual projections, we use a 3%-after-inflation standard to ensure we're not basing our plans on overly optimistic future returns.
Treasury yields have been mostly climbing since Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8, a victory that has stirred hope that campaign promises touting fiscal stimulus, regulatory rollbacks and tax cuts, could be realized and rev up the domestic economy. That hope has pushed inflation expectations higher and ratcheted up forecasts for interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve.

Talking about finances can be touchy enough, but adding addiction to those conversations can be outright taboo. But talking about these issues openly can alleviate hard feelings and financial missteps. In order to make sure everyone is on the same page, it's vital that your heirs fully understand your estate planning structure, the intent behind that structure and the physical location of key documents.
Consider John and Jane. They've been diligent savers and have built a solid balance to tap now that they've decided to retire. They've worked with a financial adviser, and determined that they'll likely have a long life in retirement. They have $1 million saved — to round off the numbers and make it easy — and want to start retirement by tapping $40,000 from their portfolio before taxes along with Social Security and other income.

In 2015, Forbes magazine listed Tung, Foo, and another partner at GGV Capital, Jenny Lee, among the world's top 100 best venture capital investors. The magazine also names GGV Capital as the second most successful VC firm after Sequoia Capital, which is known for big-ticket tech investments.
Still, the shutdown could impact some borrowers trying to manage their debt. Borrowers who want to take advantage of the government's income-driven repayment plans, which allow them to pay off their debt as a percentage of their income, need to show proof of income to their student loan servicer. They also need to recertify their income every year to stay on the plans.
For example, he said, for employees currently in the 39.6% tax bracket but with an expectation to be in the 33% tax bracket during retirement, contributions should be made to the deductible 401(k) until their taxable income lands them in the 33% bracket. It is important to keep in mind, however, that the combined contribution limit is set at $18,000, plus an additional $6,000 if age 50 or older, in 2017, Westley said.
So the real puzzle may be why the jobs market still looks pretty good.
For instance, someone earning after-tax dollars of $40,000 and spending $30,000 a year will have to wait 31.9 years to gain FIRE. In other words, if you have $10,000 left over to invest every year, and get that 5% return, it'll take that long before you have enough money to withdraw 4% of your portfolio without running out of cash.
 I appreciate the thought, but it does make me uncomfortable to accept financial gifts, partially because I know that some of these family members are not in great shape themselves and could probably use the money more responsibly. 
All told, with China and Europe driving the EV market, BEVs (battery electric vehicles) and PHEV (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) comprised 3.8% of the global market through the end of November, Inside EVs says. This represents a market share gain of 1 percentage point, given a McKinsey study which said EVs were 2.8% of the global market at the end of March 2020. While still quite small, it's worth noting that the global share was just 0.6% as recently as 2015.

The truth is that we went from being a high-earning family to a family living on a very tight budget, but our lifestyle hasn't changed that much. It's really just the rate at which we are able to save and grow our wealth that has been affected, but our day-to-day life is so much more fulfilling now that we feel financially free.

Nonetheless, the next six months do mark an important transition period that merits a close look at Social Security claiming strategies, for the brief time window that all of the tools remain on the table, whether it's an individual filing and suspending for a potential lump sum reinstatement in the future, a couple claiming spousal benefits, or a family claiming dependent or disabled child benefits while delaying individual retirement benefits until age 70. And for those lucky enough to be born in 1953 or earlier, only a few years remain to consider a Restricted Application, before that deadline ends, too!, Kitces said.
FactSet publishes a blended growth percentage change for earnings per share for the S&P 500, representing a blend of year-over-year growth of actual results already reported and the average estimates of surveyed analysts of upcoming results.
Because child-identity theft tends to be detected long after the fact, such numbers may vastly underestimate the scope of the problem. Credit-reporting companies add that thefts of minors' identities are hard to uncover because children can have legitimate credit records if parents add them to a credit card as an authorized user. Meanwhile, data breaches exposing children's personal information online are becoming more common.
He and his wife, Tracy, a former schoolteacher and now a technology coach, started saving when they were first married in 2000, putting away money every month and increasing their savings as they received raises. They recently had to adjust their contributions to pay off the last of their debt, and plan to be debt-free this fall, but they're making it up with sound and stringent financial decisions.

People dropping out of the labor force is a big problem, said Thomas Barkin, president of the Federal Reserve.
The tax planning objective of carried interest arrangements is to trade current fee income that would immediately be treated as high-taxed ordinary income and be subject to federal employment taxes for a partnership profits interest that is expected to generate future long-term capital gains that will be taxed at lower rates. Nice. You can see why this ultra-favorable tax treatment of carried interests is controversial.

Claims data, to be fair, can be erratic. But other jobs indicators also are looking healthy. Payrolls climbed by 292,000 in December. A measure of service companies' desires to hire was a very solid 55.7%, well above the 50% mark indicating expansion.
•You need to have a high and steady income. This requirement is because of the above three factors. Schwab, for one, estimates that earnings, before considering the defined-benefit plan contribution, need to be $250,000 or more a year to make the cost of running the plan low relative to the tax savings.

So, let's say you're 35 now and need to accumulate about $631,000 over the next 30 years to fund retirement health care costs. (The $631,000 is an estimated future price tag for health-care costs in retirement in 30 years.) If that's the number, then you'd need to contribute the maximum possible to your HSA each and every year for the next 30 years. For 2017, the family maximum is $6,750 or $7,750 for those age 55 or older. The alternative, for what it's worth, would be to earmark a percent or dollar amount of your traditional or Roth 401(k) savings to pay for health care in retirement. But neither account — traditional or Roth — offers you a triple tax benefit as does the HSA.

Amid calls for his ouster, President Donald Trump condemned Wednesday's violence by a mob of his supporters, as he returned to Twitter TWTR, +1.37% for the first time since a 12-hour ban. The violence has left five people dead, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer, and that department's chief has now resigned. Meanwhile, education secretary Betsy DeVos became the second member of the Trump administration to quit in the wake of the riots.
The fear is Democrats could control both houses of Congress, and push through radical tax policy, run away spending, and alter any semblance of divided government, Wright wrote.

Though Ocasio-Cortez added that the 70% rate wouldn't apply to all of that income, that detail seemed to get lost in the contentious aftermath.

The shutdown has likely inspired some government workers to pay off debts as soon as they can when the shutdown is over, but they should only do so carefully, Beasley said. Borrowers tend to want to pay off small debts first, which is naturally motivating, but they should pay attention to the steepest interest rates.
The brand was elevated to cult status after Pete Townshend, lead singer of rock band The Who, said he would go to bed on tour with two things: A cognac bottle and Dr. Martens boot.

By 30, you should have a decent chunk of change saved for your future self, experts say — in fact, ideally your account would look like a year's worth of salary, according to Boston-based investment firm Fidelity Investments, so if you make $50,000 a year, you'd have $50,000 saved already. By 35, you should have twice your salary, the firm said. The median retirement savings for a worker in their 30s was $45,000, according to Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies, which looked at workers' retirement accounts including employer-sponsored accounts and individual retirement accounts.
1. Salary is not the same as savings. Your net worth is more important than how much money you make. It's amazing how many people don't realize this simply truth. Having a high salary does not automatically make you rich; having a low salary does not automatically make you poor. All that matters is how much you save out of your salary.

Contrast that to an investment in a traditional taxable account worth $200,000 with a basis of $100,000. Need $40,000? Sell for $40,000 in proceeds. $20,000 is your gain ($100,000/$200,000 = ½. Half of $40,000 is $20,000). Regardless of income level, capital gain rates are lower than the rates on ordinary income. That $20,000 gain is taxed at anywhere from 0 to 23.8% and the other $20,000 is not taxed at all.

Macy's Inc. M, -4.97% said Thursday that same-store sales during the months of November and December 2017 rose 1% on an owned basis and were up 1.1% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. Macy's Chief Executive Jeff Gennette says the same-store sales result sets the retailer up for a positive fourth quarter. The company saw double-digit growth online and improved holiday sales across Macy's, Macy's Backstage, Bloomingdale's and its outlet, and the beauty brand Blue Mercury. The fourth-quarter FactSet consensus is for same-store sales decline of 1.7%. Included in announced cost management efforts will be staffing adjustments, with some stores seeing reductions as others hire, and 11 store closures in early 2018. Four of those closures were previously announced. Stores will close in Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities nationwide. That brings the number of shuttered stores since 2015 to 124. Macy's expects annual expense savings to total $300 million beginning fiscal 2018, and one-time charges of $160 million, or about 33 cents per share, which will be booked in the fourth quarter. Macy's also updated its guidance, and now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share of $3.59 to $3.69 including tax reform measures, versus previous guidance of $3.38 to $3.63. The company expects same-store sales on an owned basis to decline between 2.4% and 2.7%, and a decline between 2% and 2.3% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. Sales are expected to be down between 3.6% and 3.9%. The FactSet consensus is for full-year EPS of $3.44 and a same-store sales decline of 3.4%.
BEIJING (Caixin Online) – A Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm that was an early entrant in China says it will continue to bet on Internet- and mobile technology-driven businesses in the country, despite concerns that market turmoil will affect private fundraising this year.
At the recent Lola Retreat, Emma Pattee talked about how she became financially independent with rental income (in her 20s, amazing). Mrs. Frugalwoods talked about how their financial independence is based on a combo of assets and rental income, paired with some blog and book income. Ours on the other hand is based entirely on our investible assets, even though we also have a single rental property. That was a good reminder for me that FI is not necessarily based on wealth at all, but on passive income. Does your passive income cover your expenses? is the most important question, not How much do you have?
Because of the way Social Security benefits are taxed, many middle-income retirees face a tax torpedo, where their marginal tax rate can more than double. (If you'll have retirement savings of roughly $200,000 or more, consider talking to a tax professional or financial planner about how and when to claim Social Security benefits to minimize the tax effects.)

There is, however, some bad news for American workers. Pay raises for U.S. employees are not expected to improve in 2018, according to a survey of 1,000 companies released Monday by global professional services company Aon. Base pay is expected to rise 3% in 2018, up slightly from 2.9% in 2017. Spending on variable pay — incentives or bonuses — will be 12.5% of payroll, low levels not seen since 2013. This suggests a pessimistic view of corporate performance in the coming year, Ken Abosch, a strategy and development analyst at Aon, said in a statement.
Shares of tax preparation companies edged higher in midday trade Tuesday, despite the Internal Revenue Service's announcement that it would pay refunds as scheduled during the partial government shutdown. H&R Block Inc.'s stock HRB, -0.91% tacked on 0.1% and TurboTax parent Intuit Inc. shares INTU, -0.36% gained 0.7%. The IRS confirmed late Monday that it will start processing tax returns on Jan. 28 and provide refunds as scheduled. BMO Capital analyst Jeffrey Silber said that is a relatively late start to tax season compared with prior years, it is one day earlier than last year's start. Silber said this was good news for H&R's Block shares, as fears of delays due to the partial government shutdown and changes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) appear to be unwarranted. He said the tax season's start date could pull some expected fiscal fourth-quarter revenue that ends April quarter into the third-quarter ending January. H&R Block's stock has rallied 5.8% since the government shut down, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% has advanced 5.9%.

15. Take a home inventory. Take out that smartphone and photograph EVERYTHING in your house, garage, attic, etc. Open up drawers. Take photos of closet contents. Take close-ups.

That will require the Democrats to shelve their tropism for higher taxes on upper-income Americans and for the president to give up on yet more budget-busting tax cuts. Alternatively, both sides could go after the carried interest tax break for Wall Street's financial engineers — those levy lower capital gains tax rates on income that should rightly be classified as wage income.
Americans can save even more with tax-advantaged health plans. Some employers offer health savings accounts (or HSAs), which offer tax-free contributions, growth and withdrawals. Workers must have a high-deductible health plan to qualify however (which means they'd be paying more up front for their medical expenses before the insurer begins covering costs). Flexible Spending Accounts allow employees to contribute a specific amount of their salary upfront, and then use that money to spend tax-free on medical expenses throughout the year. Money in an FSA must be used before the end of the year or will be forfeited.

Netflix has missed FactSet's consensus on revenue in six of the last 10 quarters.

Today's 30 year olds (and the soon-to-be 30 year olds) are plagued with crippling student debt, which just hit a record $1.31 trillion and affects millennials more than any generation before them. On top of that, some millennials are skipping starter homes altogether for a bigger home and, as nice as that is, home prices are rising as are mortgage rates. Some may also be splurging for a wedding — scary fact: the average American wedding costs about $35,000. The last thing someone in their 30s should do, though, is leave retirement to the wayside.
A key component to these calculations is life expectancy. Although you think you will not live well into your 80s, the truth of the matter is you simply don't know. There are many people in their 50s that believe they will live a full retirement until 80+ then magically drop dead, Burns said. Even if you don't believe you may personally live to be 90 or 100, you should plan as if you will. One of the greatest fears older Americans have is running out of money, and you don't want your future self to regret not putting enough thought into that possibility.

It is said that the stock market SPX, -0.16% is not the economy, and that's true. But the stock market does convey certain information and expectations about things that affect the economy, and are affected by it, such as corporate earnings.

But here's another critical point that gets lost in the social-media scrum: Just because you're in a 24% tax bracket doesn't mean your entire income is taxed at 24%. Under current tax law, if you were a single person, you would only pay that 24% rate in 2019 on income between $84,201 and $168,400.

If an employee over-saves in a 401(k) plan, they have to act fast. Excess deferrals as well as any money earned from those extra dollars must be refunded by April 15 so that it is reported as regular income. If done after Tax Day, late distributions are subject to extra taxes and penalties. Companies may automatically stop contributions once the maximum is reached, but not always, so savers should check their accounts.
That doesn't mean the economic outlook is without risks. The sharp widening in credit spreads over the last three months, both high-yield and investment grade, seems to be mirroring the stress in the stock market.
But why Delaware? Prior to Joe Biden's election, it really only had three claims to fame.

Hi there, MarketWatchers. Don't miss these top stories:
If the index fund trend continues, and it looks likely to do so, what happens when index funds control Corporate America? Courts have often deemed shareholders to be in control of a corporation with as little as 20% of the ownership of a company. At current rates of asset inflows, it will not be long before index funds effectively control Corporate America and the corporations of many foreign countries. The Japanese system of cross corporate ownership, the keiretsu, has been blamed for decades of Japanese corporate underperformance and economic malaise. Large passive ownership of Corporate America by index funds risks a similar outcome without the counterbalancing force of large active investors and improvements in the governance oversight implemented by passive index fund managers.

Making matters worse, while adults can learn quickly that their identities have been stolen, say, after being rejected for a credit card or loan, it can take years to find out that a child has been a victim of identity theft.

Our expectation, as I said before, just really stepping back, is that there will be growth in the economy, said J.P. Morga JPM, +1.65% CFO Marianne Lake on a conference call with analysts. So I think you'll see the capital market space potentially react more quickly. And I think loan growth may have a bit of a lag, but never say never. So we just need to, I think, be a little patient to see some of that play out, but sentiment is strong. If the tax positions will be improved, profitability will be higher. Things that were rich before will be fairly valued. And so I think it should be all very constructive.

What might be of more concern to investors, is that the blended EPS estimate for the first quarter continues to worsen, to a decline of 2.9% from a drop of 2.4% last week. That's a stark change from estimates for growth of 1.9% on Jan. 11 and of 6.7% on Sept. 30.

One of the biggest changes in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was the installation of a flat 21% corporate federal income tax rate for 2018 and beyond. Before the TCJA, the maximum effective rate for profitable corporations was 35%. The Biden plan would increase the corporate tax rate to 28%. This change would raise an estimated $1.1 trillion or so over 10 years.

ECB and BOE keep with easing.As I wrote recently, the risks of a hard Brexit are very real. The Bank of England has already pledged it is ready to cut rates if things go south, which I expect to happen, and the European Central Bank has lately been losing its desire for rate increases that would move deposit rates out of negative territory. Expect central banks across the Atlantic to go very easy in 2019.

We're famous for relishing long workweeks and we take parenting to a new level, ever-involved in our children and grandchildren's lives, whether by invitation or not. And so we avoid conflict by saying yes to multiple requests for babysitting, volunteering, caregiving for an aging parent and taking on extra projects at work, because we don't want to let others down or make ourselves look bad.
The IRS started mailing approximately 8 million debit cards this week loaded with the economic impact payments. Over the summer, some people receiving the first round of payments accidentally threw out the debit cards, thinking they were junk mail.
Sequence of returns risk — What happens if you retire into a recession (as it looks like we might)? Will your plan be able to sustain you if you deplete more of your assets early in your retirement? Will you plan to go back to work before your resume gap gets too long, or will you drastically trim back your spending? In our case, our spending plan can be cut up to 50% if necessary, not that that would be especially fun, but we'll plan to cut our spending by roughly the percentage of the market drop. Fortunately, we have boatloads of travel miles stockpiled and can still travel even if we are in a constrained spending situation.
The last government shutdown, in January 2018, lasted only two days and did not affect taxpayers. But the one prior, which happened in 2013 under the Obama administration, went on for 16 days and caused $2.2 billion in delayed refunds to individuals and another $1.5 billion to businesses. More than 90% of IRS workers were furloughed, meaning they were not working under the shutdown.

The exclusion ratio table expects a 20-year lifespan for our hypothetical 65 year-old and spreads the return of principal over that period. The result is that the IRS consider $417 of the $565 as tax-free return of principal and only $148 as interest taxed as ordinary income. Once he has received 20 years of payments (age 85), he has received back all of his initial investment and all of his payments are fully taxable for the remainder of his life.

You also need to think about health insurance, especially if you have kids. If you are on a spouse's health insurance plans, you need to decide whether you're going to negotiate to stay on the plan or get new health insurance. Also take a look at if you have enough savings to get you through a couple of months, and if you don't, ask for a loan from a family member or close friend, because there are some unavoidable first expenses when starting out.

Soft dollar: There's an inverse relationship between the strength of commodity prices and U.S. currency, since these raw materials are priced in dollars. However, the trend lately is not for a strong dollar but a weak one. In fact, the U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.13% just hit a three-month low. And this after the benchmark measure for the dollar declined almost 10% during 2017. This currency dynamic creates yet an additional tailwind for gold prices.

Why does the U.S. lag China and Europe? The gradual phasing out of generous federal tax credits—up to $7,500 in some cases—hasn't helped. Another has been cheap gasoline prices.

But what appears to be a stall-out for equities—though not an outright reversal—highlights investors' apparent reassessment of some of the factors that had accelerated a rally in equities after Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. In theory, the prospect of economic growth and rising inflation are bullish for the dollar, stocks, but bad news for assets like gold, which doesn't bear a yield and is priced in dollars.

A critical mistake people can make when it comes to retirement income planning is limiting their strategy to interest and dividends and neglecting the power of rebalancing to capture portfolio growth as an additional income source. And in addition to helping you take a more holistic approach to generating income, it has the added benefit of forcing a good habit of regularly rebalancing your portfolio back to its intended asset allocation based on your goals, time horizon and risk tolerance — an important fundamental of successful investing and one that's even more critical for people approaching or in retirement.
Instead, the driving force behind the session's stock-market gains and other financial-market moves appeared to be optimism over the prospect for another, larger round of aid spending following a Democratic sweep of a pair of runoff elections in Georgia that will give the party control of the Senate as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office on Jan. 20. Democrats retained control of the House in the Nov. 3 elections.
If you're an investor, you've almost certainly heard of having an appropriate asset allocation to stocks and bonds, maybe 60% stocks and 40% bonds, and then periodically rebalancing. Some investments rise and others fall at different times under different market conditions.

The 40s decade is a critical time for retirement savings, as it is likely when a person will reach their peak income and can make a dent in their long-term goals if they haven't yet begun to do so. For a 40-year-old with nothing saved for retirement, putting away $650 a month (about 15% of a $50,000 salary) can get them $1 million in retirement savings by age 67, according to calculations on personal finance personality Dave Ramsey's website.
