President-elect Donald Trump's lawyer announced his plan on Wednesday to address several conflict-of-interest concerns, but the plan intended to limit the ability of foreign dignitaries to exert influence on Trump by staying in his hotels still has some holes.\n\nThe plan, presented by Sheri Dillon of law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, includes details of the transfer of management of his businesses and voluntary limits to be imposed on those businesses' ability to engage in transactions that could pose any conflict-of-interest concerns.\n\nThe Washington Post reported in December that Trump hotels were drawing new business from foreign leaders who booked rooms and meeting space at Trump's new Washington D.C. hotel, potentially giving the appearance of trying to curry favor with the new administration.\n\nWhen asked about the details of the hotel payments part of the plan, a spokeswoman for Shari Dillon and law firm Morgan Lewis emailed,  We do not comment on our clients or the work we do for them.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution's Foreign Emoluments Clause prohibits an individual holding an Office of Profit or Trust under the United States from accept[ing] a present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State without congressional approval.\n\nAlso read: 'Emoluments' the unlikely star of Trump news conference\n\nA letter released after the president-elect's news conference on Wednesday sought to explain the President-elect's plan in more detail. It says that foreign governments' business at a Trump International Hotel or similar business is not a present, Emolument, Office, or Title. Therefore, business from foreign governments and their dignitaries is not a 'present' or 'emolument' as long they are receiving fair value for their money.\n\nIn short, says the letter, the Constitution does not forbid fair-market-value transactions with foreign officials.\n\nSome commentators, most notably Professor Richard Painter of the University of Minnesota Law School, Norm Eisen of the Brookings Institution, and Professor Larry Tribe of Harvard Law argued recently in an article in The Atlantic magazine for a much broader definition of emolument to cover anything of value.\n\nAndy Grewal, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Law, says he agrees with the Trump team interpretation instead. If a foreign government pays for a Trump hotel room at the market price, that's permissible. But if they paid more than other customers, then an emoluments problem might arise.\n\nThe incoming administration's plan proposes to donate all profits from foreign governments' patronage of Trump hotels and similar businesses during his presidential term to the U.S. Treasury. His lawyers say he wants to eliminate any distractions by going beyond what the Constitution requires.\n\nSee also:Why Trump will be free to make more endorsements like he did with L.L. Bean\n\nMilan Markovic, an associate professor of law at Texas A&M, has written on the Trump conflicts issue and says that the hotels payment plan may be difficult to put into place. There are some big definitional issues with terms like 'similar businesses' and 'all profits'. It's also unclear how the process will work with individuals who have ties to foreign governments but are not part of the official diplomatic corp, Markovic said.\n\nGrewal acknowledges the proposed process will be complex. Effective ethical walls take a lot of work to implement successfully. A law firm can set up the structure, but you need a reputable accounting firm will still be needed to calculate the profits from foreign government transactions, Grewal said. The best approach is to hire a reputable firm and take the conservative approach. When in doubt they should err on the side of sending more profits rather than less to the Treasury, to fulfill the promise made.\n\nIn the end, says Grewal, The success of this plan depends on the good faith of the people involved, like all ethical arrangements do.\n\nBut there's been some criticism of the plan that centers on Trump's publicity benefit from giving some of his profits to the Treasury.\n\nGrewal says that's not terribly relevant. Announcing gifts is what most donors do and Trump is really being charitable, he says, because he is not constitutionally obliged to turn over profits from arms-length transactions with foreign governments.\n\nSee also:Ethics laws don't require Trump to give up control of his 'unprecedented' portfolio\n\nIt's not yet clear whether Trump will be able to take a charitable deduction on his personal tax return from this charitable act.\n\nRead: What could be in the taxes that Trump has vowed not to release\n\nNot everyone is buying into the plan, however. As president, he must take steps to prevent even the appearance a conflict of interest, says Thomas R. Fox, an attorney and author of the book Doing Compliance, and the Trump proposal fails even on that limited scale.\n\nThe director of the Office of Government Ethics says his office was not consulted. In remarks delivered late Wednesday at the Brookings Institution, Walter Shaub said, In developing the current plan, the President-elect did not have the benefit of OGE's guidance. So, to be clear, OGE's primary recommendation is that he divest his conflicting financial interests. Nothing short of divestiture will resolve these conflicts.\n\nIn addition, the law firm's letter says that the Trump Organization has already, in essence, been functioning only as an asset management company, since it hasn't sought or entered into any new deals since the election.\n\nMarkovic says that undermines the assertion by Dillon at the news conference that no one but Trump, his sons or his current CFO, Allen Weisselberg, can competently run the company. There is nothing to prevent a qualified asset manager from running it, especially if there are no new domestic deals to go with the voluntary ban on foreign deals.
A majority of Americans are renting on the cheap — at least, compared to what they'd be paying if they bought a home.\n\nIn more than half (59%) of housing markets nationwide — 442 of 755 U.S. counties — renting a three-bedroom property is now more affordable than buying a median-priced home, according to a new report from real-estate data firm Attom Data Solutions. Among the 40 counties across the country with more than 1 million residents, only three had housing markets where it was still cheaper to buy a home than rent one: Wayne County (Detroit), Mich.; Philadelphia County, Pa.; and Cuyahoga County, Ohio.\n\nMoreover, home prices are rising faster than wages in 80% of housing markets nationwide, including everywhere from Chicago to Houston to Phoenix.\n\n 'The buy-versus-rent calculus is shifting toward renting being more affordable.'  — Daren Blomquist, vice president at Attom Data Solutions\n\nThe buy-versus-rent calculus is shifting toward renting being more affordable, said Daren Blomquist, senior vice president at Attom Data Solutions. With a strong jobs market, Americans want to stay mobile and often can't afford to buy near urban centers where they're more likely to get a job at higher wages, he said.\n\nDon't miss: Why $1 million can't buy you a luxury home anymore\n\nRenting may be better than owning to build wealth — if you're disciplined enough to invest the money you save by not owning a property, a 2017 study suggested. When considering buying and building wealth through equity appreciation versus renting, and reinvesting in a portfolio of stocks and bonds, property appreciation does not change the results, co-author Ken Johnson, real estate economist at Florida Atlantic University's College of Business, said.\n\nWhat's contributing to this shift toward renting?\n\nInterest rates rose last year and are expected to keep increasing in 2019, making buying a home with a mortgage less affordable for many — even younger Americans who aim to pay off their home in 20 or 30 years and reap the appreciation of a rise in home values. And despite a slight drop in demand in some housing markets, tight housing inventory across the country is still fueling competition for homes and consequently making them more expensive.\n\n Large swaths of the New Jersey and New York commuting belt have seen double-digit house price increases. \n\nPlus, Blomquist said, the drive until you afford mentality has made many once-affordable suburbs and exurbs vastly more expensive. Large swaths of the New Jersey and New York commuting belt have seen double-digit house price increases in recent years, for instance.\n\nThe new tax law has further complicated the math in deciding whether to rent or buy, according to the Urban Institute. Under the 2017 tax code, a family of three with an annual income of $150,000 would be better off buying if their rent exceeded $1,507 per month. But with the new tax code, they'd have to pay more than $1,885 per month to make buying worthwhile. Do we expect people not to buy because of these changes? At the margin, yes, researchers at the Urban Institute wrote.\n\n The new tax law limits your deduction for state and local income and property taxes to a combined total of $10,000. \n\nAs MarketWatch's Tax Guy Bill Bischoff wrote, the new law limits your deduction for state and local income and property taxes to a combined total of $10,000 ($5,000 if you use married filing separate status). Foreign real property taxes can no longer be deducted. So no more property tax write-offs for your place in Cabo. However, you can still choose to deduct state and local sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes.\n\nRents are rising faster than wages in most markets\n\n More renters may also find themselves priced out of the housing market, because home prices are appreciating more quickly than rents in 59% of markets. \n\nWhat's more, in 52% of markets, including Chicago and Los Angeles, rents are rising faster than wages. And more renters may also find themselves priced out of the housing market, because home prices are appreciating more quickly than rents in 70% of markets. As a result, the old guideline of not spending more than 30% of your income on rent (or a mortgage) has become increasingly difficult to follow in cities like San Francisco and New York.\n\nTake Huntsville, Ala., which had the most affordable rental market in the country back in January 2018, according to Attom Data Solutions. Last year, the average renter there only had to devote 22.3% of their wages to rent. But home prices in that area rose nearly 11% between 2016 and 2017, as investors flocked and bought up properties to rent out. And the prevailing wages in places like Huntsville aren't as high as in cities like New York or Seattle.\n\nSo for those who are no longer happy renting, they may not have much choice. It's great in theory to buy in those markets and have a lot of disposable income, but the problem is going to be finding a job, period, or a job that will pay as well, Blomquist said.

If ever a stretch of stock market activity could get investment managers to talk out of both sides of their mouths, it's these first weeks of 2016.\n\nThe inauspicious start to the year coincides with the time when mutual fund managers are writing their annual notes to shareholders. Now a manager must explain average or mediocre results from 2015, as well as allay the rising fears shareholders have after 2016's rocky start.\n\nYet too often there's a difference between what fund managers say and what they mean. Knowing the catch phrases and double-talk can help you determine if your manager has courage in their methods and convictions, or are spewing sewage.\n\nSkybridge Capital CEO: Markets not in 'super-crisis'\n\nHere is what you can expect to hear from managers, and what that verbiage really means:\n\nWhat they say: It's a challenging market.\n\nWhat they mean: We're doing whatever we can to make money — or to minimize losses compared to the appropriate benchmark. But if we aren't successful, we plan to blame our failings on the market.\n\nWhat they say: It's a stock picker's market.\n\nWhat they mean: Not many stocks made money last year, and that's likely to happen again this year.\n\nActively managed U.S. stock funds' performance in 2015 mostly disproved the idea that stock pickers can beat the market when the market is beat. The S&P 500 SPX, -0.40% finished up about 1.25% for the year, mostly based on great results from just a few stocks; skim off the top 20 stocks and the index would have been negative.\n\nWith so many stocks in the index flat or down, it should have been pretty easy to drop a bunch of losers and produce a win, yet only about 20% of large-cap funds were able to beat the S&P 500. Don't expect much better in 2016.\n\nWhat they say: We're cautiously optimistic.\n\nWhat they mean: We have no clue, just hope.\n\nCautiously optimistic makes shareholders think everything will be okay. The reason management wants to appear tentatively hopeful is because shareholders — the people who have faith that the manager knows what he or she is doing — actually are cautiously optimistic about their funds.\n\nWhat they say: We protected profits and repositioned the portfolio for the year ahead.\n\nWhat they mean: Did you see the 1099 we sent you showing a huge, unexpected capital gain? Now you know why you owe Uncle Sam so much money [if you hold the fund in a taxable account].\n\nIf a fund had a surprise gains distribution — especially if it posted losses for the year — and generated a fat and unexpected tax bill for shareholders, that's a hassle. You should review whether the fund is appropriate for you, rather than thinking management has done you a favor.\n\nWhat they say: The market [economy/Fed/other force for change] moved in ways we didn't foresee.\n\nWhat they mean: Oops.\n\nManagement's crystal ball was murky, but they'd like you to think they're on top of the market and that next time will be better.\n\nSmart investors know fund managers won't always be right, and tend to factor that into the way they build a portfolio. Savvy fund managers do the same; while the market can be disappointing, they're not surprised by anything that's remotely normal, like interest-rate changes, corporate crises and much more.\n\nManagement should tell you what they foresee and how they plan to address it. If that explanation rings phony or fake, consider an index fund or a manager who is willing to be direct and honest. That will lead you to a fund that serves you reasonably no matter what the market dishes out.
Pence says Trump has 'impression' that past presidents wanted wall: Vice President Mike Pence has addressed President Donald Trump's recent claim that former commanders-in-chief privately have said they wanted to build a wall at the Mexican border.\n\nI know the president has said that that was his impression from previous administrations, previous presidents, Pence told NBC News correspondent Hallie Jackson.\n\nThat came after Jackson asked: Which former presidents told President Trump, as he said, that he should've built a wall? All their representatives have denied that that was the case.\n\nThe implication of Pence's comment is that Trump couldn't distinguish between his own impressions and objectively-held reality, tweeted Maggie Haberman, a White House correspondent for The New York Times.\n\nTrump is due to deliver a prime-time address to the country about the southern border that will be aired live at 9 p.m. Eastern Tuesday by the major TV networks. The speech will come on the 18th day of a partial government shutdown that has been sparked by a dispute over money for Trump's proposed border wall.\n\nDemocrats to get airtime after Trump speech:The major networks have said they will broadcast the Democratic response to Trump's Oval Office speech, but it was not clear early Tuesday who would deliver it.\n\nThat came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said late Monday that Democrats should be given equal airtime after Trump's address.\n\nNow that the television networks have decided to air the president's address, which if his past statements are any indication will be full of malice and misinformation, Democrats must immediately be given equal airtime, the two Democratic leaders said in a statement Monday night.\n\n'Do less press,' columnist tells Ocasio-Cortez: The consensus on Capitol Hill about new Rep.

He lost by 16 points to Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine in a November election as Virginia Republicans also lost three U.S. House seats, the Post points out. Stewart said his departure from state politics will last until and unless the commonwealth is ready for my views on things, and that's not right now, clearly.\n\nThe revolving door between Capitol Hill and K Street kicks into 'hyper-spin' this week: Just days into the new Congress, recently departed lawmakers and aides are announcing new lobbyist gigs, notes a Roll Call report.\n\nThose leaving Capitol Hill for K Street gigs include former Sen.

All the Money in the World, Ridley Scott's dramatization of the events that led to frugal billionaire oil tycoon J. Paul Getty's reluctantly paying about $3 million to the Italian criminals who kidnapped his teenage grandson, attracted notoriety for an unusual eleventh-hour casting switch.\n\nLittle over six weeks before the movie's release, director Scott opted to replace Kevin Spacey, the original actor playing J. Paul Getty, with Christopher Plummer, following widespread allegations of sexual assault made against Spacey. The reshoot reportedly cost Sony $10 million. On Tuesday, Plummer was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.\n\nAs good as Plummer is at playing Getty, the one-time richest man in the world who died in 1976 with an estimated fortune of $2 billion, the subject himself will always cast a compelling shadow over any biopic.\n\nAccording to Deadline Hollywood, 57% of moviegoers said they bought tickets for All the Money in the World, made and released by Sony Pictures Entertainment, the filmmaking arm of Sony Corp. SNE, -0.56% , on its first night of release because of the Getty family subject matter.\n\nThe film, which stars Michelle Williams as Getty's impoverished daughter-in-law Gail, and Mark Wahlberg as his security investigator Fletcher Chase, explores the chasm between Getty's colossal fortune and his family troubles, which culminated in Italian captors kidnapping his grandson John Paul Getty III in 1973 and cutting off his right ear before Getty paid the $3 million ransom. Getty himself shelled out $2.2 million, the maximum that was tax deductible, and lent his drug-addled son John Paul Getty Jr. the remaining $800,000 at 4% interest.\n\nPeople who participate in the markets know money is a powerful, complicated, almost abstract, force — there are those who control it and those who are controlled by it, the film's screenwriter David Scarpa told MarketWatch. To a certain extent Getty was a man who controlled money but he was also controlled by it. He was able to accumulate a vast amount of it and yet at the same time wasn't able to turn it to his own ends in the sense of making his life better.\n\nWhile All the Money in the World is a family drama and crime mystery, Plummer's Getty is frequently depicted in the movie getting distracted by inspecting the stock market on a ticker tape. He was absolutely obsessed with the markets and that obsession, combined with intelligence, was what drove him, said Scarpa. For many traders in the market, money represents a way of keeping score. For others it becomes their identity. For Getty, it's a bit of a cautionary tale in the sense that it consumed his ego.\n\nHe added: There's a fine line between somebody like a Getty who is depicted as a dark and tragic character and Warren Buffett, who is thrifty in his own way and has amassed this great fortune yet is valorized in popular culture.\n\nThe notoriously parsimonious Getty initially rejected the kidnapper's demand for $17 million on the grounds that he didn't believe in paying kidnappers since it increased the likelihood of his 14 other grandchildren also being abducted.\n\nDid Getty eventually pay up because the captors reduced their fiscal demands or due to a crisis of conscience? It's a combination of both, said Scarpa. Getty says in the film, 'You have to go get him...as inexpensively as possible.'\n\nIf we simply presented this as a story of a greedy man, or as a Scrooge, it wouldn't work, Scarpa noted. It has to be the story of a man who truly loves his grandson and who desperately wants to have a family. Yet money has taken such a hold on him that he finds it impossible to part with it.\n\nScarpa said of Getty's mindset: There are two sides to this man's brain. There's a very human side and there's also a very intellectual side that's constantly thinking in terms of his net worth...I think he viewed everything as investments and was less comfortable in the world of human relationships than he was in the analytical world of money.\n\nThe screenwriter said the conflict between commerce and family manifested itself long before the five-times married Getty was forced to pay ransom to rescue his grandson: Getty was talented as a trader in the oil business in his twenties and yet his mother didn't trust him, setting up the family trust in such a way that he didn't have full access to the funds.\n\nBut she set it up as a charitable trust so he was able to generate returns from the trust without having to pay tax. In a sense it was a tax shelter so his mother's distrust led in part to him building up a vast fortune, he said.\n\nThis imbalance between humanity and finance was also reflected in the art collection he amassed which now forms the basis of the Getty Museum in California, according to Scarpa. One of the criticisms that was leveled at him as a collector was that he viewed every work of art as a trade. He bought artworks he thought were undervalued and this led him into antiques. But as a result it meant his collection was weak in masterpieces, he said.\n\nThe origins of All the Money in the World lie in its producer Quentin Curtis reading John Pearson's 1995 book, Painfully Rich: The Outrageous Fortune and Misfortunes of the Heirs of J. Paul Getty, and believing it cried out for cinematic treatment.\n\nThe themes of money and power are obviously of interest, said Chris Clark, another producer on the film. But there's a chapter in Pearson's book entitled Kidnap and Ransom, which reads exactly like a movie plot. The kidnap went straight to the heart of his values and led to a titanic struggle between a father and his daughter-in-law.\n\nPlummer's nuanced, humane Getty is worlds apart from the cartoonish caricatures of billionaires that Hollywood too often serves up. It's even more extraordinary given his role was reshot in 8 to 10 days by Ridley Scott. It was a huge gamble doing it but one that was done for the right reasons, said producer Clark.\n\nLogistically it was complicated but once Plummer was in and we could sort out Michelle and Mark's schedules — which wasn't easy because they had to give up their Thanksgiving holiday — it became all about planning and organization.\n\nEverything fell into place with people working incredibly long hours. We were going back to the locations that we had been before and shooting the same scenes we'd filmed before so there was a familiarity but also an element of the unknown, Clark said.\n\nHow does Plummer's Getty compare with that of Spacey's portrayal? I think Christopher Plummer's take is more emotional and more dynamic, said Scarpa. The Spacey take was a little more cold. Plummer was able to be a little bit more witty. There's a little more color. He seems to get him.\n\nBut would Getty get bitcoin if he was still alive? Getty was very focused on real things, real assets whether it be oil or art, said Scarpa. He would have to know what he was getting into with bitcoin before he put a penny into it. I think he'd see through it! I don't think he'd have anything to do with it.

Saving money when preparing for a baby is important, but there are several financial vehicles that could make a child's life easier when they're out of diapers (and high school).\n\nThese are long-term goals and time is on your side for all of them, said Douglas Boneparth, a financial adviser and president of advisory firm Bone Fide Wealth in New York.\n\nRaising kids is expensive. The average cost of raising a child is $233,610 for a child born in 2015 through age 17, according to a recent report from the United States Department of Agriculture. (It's significantly more if you're a high-earner). When a second child is welcomed into the family, the costs continue to pile up: hand-me-downs are nice, but parents will likely need to expand their living spaces, update their cars, save for college (again) and pay for promises, like summer camp sessions and soccer league.\n\nSee: My parents made the smartest financial decision of my life\n\nBut while it's easy to spend when it comes to kids, parents should remember to prioritize their own retirement savings before their child's college fund experts say, mostly because you can take out a loan for education but not for your golden years. Still, if your goals include saving money for your children's educations, first homes, weddings and anything in between, here's what you can do:\n\nCollege savings accounts\n\nFor those looking to pay for their children's diplomas, one strategy is a 529 plan, a state-sponsored savings plan that comes with tax-free growth and distributions. This investment vehicle is best for parents who know the money will be used for higher education expenses, and family and friends can also contribute once the account is established. It should be a family goal, said Paul Curley, director of college savings research at research firm Strategic Insight.\n\nThe downside? Paying for anything other than education costs will result in a penalty, so if your child isn't going to use the money for school it may make sense to transfer the account to a family member (or yourself) who will. Other college savings options include prepaid tuition plans, where parents lock in tuition payments at a slightly higher rate than current prices but likely lower rate than future prices, and Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, which can also be used for qualified elementary and secondary school expenses and is funded with after-tax dollars. One other risk is that college savings accounts in a child's name might hinder potential scholarships or financial aid, said Peggy Doviak, a financial adviser and principal of D.M. Wealth Management in Norman, Okla.\n\nSee also: 6 tax breaks to help you pay for college\n\nCustodial accounts\n\nCustodial accounts are usually managed at a bank or brokerage, and placed in the child's name. There are two custodial accounts well-known for college savings: Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) and the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA), but children are not required to use these assets for their schooling if they choose not to when they are no longer minors. UGMA and UTMA accounts do not have contribution limits and are also subject to Kiddie Tax, since the child includes it as income on her tax returns. UGMAs include securities, whereas UTMAs can include property such as real estate and fine art, according to education site FinAid.org.\n\nParents and others should beware of potential gift taxes, however. The annual limit is $14,000 per child (and double if you have a spouse willing to gift that much). UTMA and UGMA accounts are irrevocable, which means you will not get access to the money back, so don't put away money you may need. You don't want to put yourself at risk for your own purposes because you were being very kind to your children, Boneparth said. The last thing you want to do is incur penalties because you didn't plan ahead or plan for emergencies appropriately.\n\nTrust accounts\n\nParents can also set up trusts for their children, though they should work with an attorney to draft the documents instead of attempting to do it themselves, said Kevin Couper, a financial adviser at Sontag Advisory in New York. Trusts, which are not always tax advantageous and are also subject to gift limitations, can incorporate any rules by the parents, such as what age the children gain control of the account and how frequently the money is distributed to the child. There is a lot of flexibility, he said. You wouldn't necessarily choose this option for a short-term goal, Boneparth said, but it would make sense for a considerable sum of money.\n\nHow credit scores predict what you will buy next\n\nRetirement accounts\n\nIt may seem unusual to set up a retirement account for your child, but there are benefits. When it comes to saving for retirement, the earlier the better, but these accounts can also be used for education purposes or just about anything else. Roth IRA withdrawals can be done tax-free so long as it's solely from he person's contributions, not earnings. So for example, say you contribute $1,000 every year for five years, you'd be able to take out $5,000 the following year and it would be tax- and penalty-free. Children can get started with a retirement account at a young age, even with neighborhood jobs like dog sitting. For parents who are self-employed, it can be particularly easy for kids to have an account opened if you hire them as a part-time worker.\n\nThe greatest gift of all\n\nOne of the greatest gifts a parent can give their children is financial literacy. There is a significant lack of financial education in the U.S. Only 20 states require high school students to take a course in economics, according to a 2016 survey from New York-based financial education advocacy group Council for Economic Education. A lack of financial education can cost investors $200 billion over 20 years. There are numerous resources kids can check to learn about money, including a government site with a page dedicated to saving money. Kids think money comes out of ATMs or you wave a card or a phone at something and it's yours, said Danielle Howard, a financial adviser and owner of advisory firm Wealth By Design in Basalt, Colo. If there is a goal — it may be a toy, or college, it may be a car — sit down and have a conversation with your kids about what they want to do.

As most retirees and soon-to-retirees already know, Social Security is slated to run out of money in 2034 and, unless changes are made between now and then, beneficiaries beginning in that year will receive only 79% of what they otherwise would be owed.\n\nBut how likely is it that our politicians would actually let this come to pass? Social Security is widely assumed to be the third rail of politics, zapping politicians who dare to tinker with it. If so, then we need not worry about the subject of a recent column: What Social Security running out of money would mean for our retirement planning.\n\nTo be sure, predicting what will come out of Congress in the next few months is an inexact science at best, much less the next 15 years. But if anyone can gauge Social Security's real-world prospects, it should be Andy Landis, author of Social Security: The Inside Story. Landis, for those of you who don't know him, is a former Social Security Administration representative who has several decades of experience explaining the intricacies of Social Security to retirees and soon-to-be-retirees.\n\nIn my interview with him, Landis started by reviewing the amendments to Social Security that were enacted in 1983, which is the last time that changes were enacted. He pointed out that the Social Security trust fund was slated to run out of money in July of that year, and the changes that averted that possibility weren't enacted until March—with just four months to spare, in other words. Landis characterized the changes as gentle, phased in, and targeted in the future. They included the gradual increase in the full retirement age and an acceleration of a previously-enacted payroll tax increase; in addition, up to one-half of the value of Social Security benefits were made potentially taxable.\n\nWith those changes, the Social Security system immediately began to run a sizable yearly surplus. The projection at that time was that the changes would postpone when Social Security would run out of money until the mid-2030s.\n\nLandis emphasized, therefore, that there's nothing new or surprising in the Social security system's current projection that it will run out of money in 2034. That's almost precisely what the actuaries were projecting more than 30 years ago. There's no more of a Social Security funding crisis now than what was envisioned then after the 1983 changes were enacted.\n\nWhat lessons can we learn from this experience? One is that we shouldn't be surprised if our politicians will wait until the last minute to make necessary changes to the Social Security system. If so, then we probably should assume that Social Security's current payout rules will stay largely or completely in place for the next 15 years.\n\nThe other lesson, according to Landis: Changes, when they eventually do get enacted, are likely to be incremental rather than drastic. That's because draconian changes are not necessary in order to keep Social Security solvent.\n\nIn fact, minor changes can have a large impact. Consider, by way of illustration, the financial impact of reducing the annual cost of living adjustment by 1 percentage point over what it would be each year: The Social Security Administration estimates that this would extend by 10 years the point at which Social Security runs out of money.\n\nTo put such a COLA modification into perspective, consider that the average monthly Social Security benefit is $1,404. The COLA for next year is 2.8%, which would otherwise increase this monthly payment by $39. A reduction of that COLA by 1 percentage point would reduce the monthly increase to $25, or $14 less.\n\n(Let me hasten to say that, in providing this illustration, I am not recommending that this change be made. I am not taking a position on that. I am just using it to illustrate the magnitude of what could add 10 years to the solvency of the Social Security trust fund.)\n\nThe bottom line, according to Landis: The doom and gloomers notwithstanding, the Social Security system is not in crisis. Changes eventually will have to be made, but we've known that for decades.\n\nRead: People who saved for retirement are being punished by Social Security taxes\n\nLandis also took issue with those who argue that, far from the Social Security system running out of money in 2034, it is broke now. Those who make that argument point out that the much-vaunted Social Security trust fund of nearly $3 trillion doesn't really exist—the money was deposited with the U.S. Treasury where it was long ago spent.\n\nLandis responds that of course the Social Security Administration deposited its surplus with the U.S. Treasury, since it is required by law to purchase U.S. Treasury bonds with its surplus. And of course the U.S. Treasury has spent the proceeds of the bonds it sold.\n\nBut the same could be said of any bond. When you purchase a bond from a company, for example, it's with the full expectation that the firm will use those proceeds rather than stuff them in a mattress. Landis therefore made the following offer to those who insist that the U.S. Treasury bonds purchased by the Social Security Administration are worthless: He would be happy to take off their hands the allegedly worthless government bonds that they own.\n\nIf you decline his offer, then you by extension have to concede that the Social Security trust fund is not empty.\n\nFor more information, including descriptions of the Hulbert Sentiment Indices, go to The Hulbert Financial Digest or email mark@hulbertratings.com.
Oracle Corp.'s Larry Ellison has disclosed a $1 billion stake in Tesla Inc.\n\nThe holding in the luxury electric car-maker was revealed in a filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission.
Tiffany & Co.'s tif price target was bumped up to $108 from $96 at Wells Fargo after the luxury jeweler announced plans to reinvest its tax reform savings in the business. Analysts maintained their market perform stock rating. Tiffany shares are up 2.1% in Wednesday trading. What's most interesting about this is that Tiffany is essentially saying that they plan to reinvest all of their upcoming tax upside (which we estimate to be 35-to-40 cents) back into the business - a prudent move given their need to invest more heavily in sales driving initiatives, the Wells Fargo note says. During Wednesday's premarket, Tiffany announced its holiday sales figures and said it would take a $115 million-to-$165 million charge for the quarter ending Jan. 31, 2018 to reevaluate deferred tax assets and repatriation tax on foreign earnings. For fiscal 2018, Tiffany anticipates increased levels of spending in a number of areas, including technology, marketing communications, visual merchandising, digital and store presentations, the release said. Wells Fargo analysts believe this strategy could be a positive in the long term as Tiffany's top-line performance has been choppy for the past few years, potentially requiring significant investment to reinvigorate growth. Tiffany shares are up 37.4% for the past year, outpacing the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% , which is up 23.3% for the period.
What do Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and Jeff Bezos have in common?\n\nThey are among eight billionaires who have as much wealth as the poorest half of the world — 3.6 billion people, according international charity Oxfam, which presented a fresh report on the lack of any progress in closing a vast income gap ahead of the World Economic Forum that kicked off Monday in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nSee:Opinion: Davos elite promise global solutions, but they're part of the problem\n\nOxfam said new data from its report An Economy for the 99%, shows that between 1988 and 2011, the incomes of the poorest 10% rose by just $3 a year, while incomes of the richest 1% increased 182 times that much. In 2015, the world's richest 1% held on to their share of global wealth, owning vastly more than the other 99%, said the charity.\n\n 'It is beyond grotesque that a group of men who could easily fit in a single golf buggy own more than the poorest half of humanity.'  — — Mark Goldring, Oxfam, GB chief executive\n\nOxfam blames that gap on corporate tax dodging, the squeezing of workers and producers and an overall obsession by companies with maximizing shareholder profits. Crony capitalism also gets a mention, and the charity said Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -2.92% , the parent company of Google, has become one of the biggest lobbyists in Washington.\n\nOxfam draws its eight richest from the Forbes Billionaires list that was last published March 2016, and used research from the Credit Suisse Global Wealth Databook. (Bloomberg has a running Billionaires Index that can be found here). At the time, that list included:\n\nCost-estimating website HowMuch.net also did a great job illustrating the point with what it described as stark visual proof of global inequality:\n\nSome have taken issue with Oxfam's methodology — the value of a person's assets, such as property, minus debts. Under this criteria, some have argued, an indebted Harvard graduate, who would have high future earnings potential, would get lumped into the poor category.\n\nRead:Mark Zuckerberg's net worth jumps $5 billion to start 2017\n\nIn a methodology report attached to the January report, Oxfam addressed that criticism, saying that while a number of such cases exist, the group is insignificant at the aggregate global level. Oxfam notes that the table below shows just 1% of people in the bottom 50% are from North America, while 70% live in low-income countries:
Saving for retirement used to be somewhat simple and straightforward. In the workplace, you saved using a traditional 401(k). Then things got it a little more complicated.\n\nIn addition to a traditional 401(k), you could save using a Roth 401(k). And then things got even more complicated.\n\nIn addition to a traditional 401(k) and a Roth 401(k), you could save just for health-care expenses in retirement using a health savings account (HSA).\n\nSo, what should those saving for retirement, and especially Generations X and Generation Y (the millennials), do if they have all three types of accounts available to them in the workplace?\n\nWell, in the old days, before the HSA, the advice was this: Save using a traditional 401(k) if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement or save using a Roth 401(k) if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.\n\nBut an HSA — if it and a high deductible health plan (HDHP) are part of your employee benefits package — complicates things a bit. That's partly because your tax bracket now and in retirement doesn't matter as much. The money goes into the HSA before taxes (like a traditional 401(k)); grows tax-free (as do traditional and Roth 401(k)s); and distributions are tax-free (like a Roth 401(k)) if used for health-care expenses in retirement.\n\nWhat's more, the HSA gives savers a way to earmark money for an expenditure that currently represents 10% to 15% of all expenses in retirement. So, instead of using all the money in your 401(k) to fund all your expenses in retirement: housing, health care, food, transportation and so on. You would use your HSA to fund just health-care expenses and your 401(k) to pay for all the other expenses.\n\nThe new funding order\n\nGiven that, some advisers are suggesting a new funding order for your retirement accounts. One could argue (savers) should fund their 401(k) up to employer's match, use any savings above the match amount to fund an HSA account and then use savings above that to fund a traditional or Roth IRA, or use for additional 401(k) contributions, said Rianka Dorsainvil, a certified financial planner and founder and president of Your Greatest Contribution. The latter contribution recommendation depends on the (saver's) income and whether from a tax strategy standpoint which vehicle would make the most sense for the (saver) to invest.\n\nGet the match\n\nThat funding order has its share of critics, but most advisers agree that savers should fund their 401(k) — Roth or traditional depending on your anticipated tax bracket in retirement — to get your employer's full match.\n\nFirst and foremost, we emphasize getting the free money, said Laurie Adams Belew, a partner and financial adviser with FJY Financial. If a retirement plan includes a match, then at least contribute enough to maximize the employer contribution.\n\nHow credit scores predict what you will buy next\n\nTax bracket in retirement\n\nMost advisers also agree that the decision to save first in a traditional or Roth 401(k) depends on the current and future expected tax brackets. In general, however, Vincent Barbera, a certified financial planner and managing partner with Newbridge Wealth recommends that Generation Xers — those born 1965 through 1980 — contribute first to a traditional 401(k). Odds are they need the tax deduction, he said.\n\nFor millennials — those born 1981 through 1997 — the opposite may be true, Barbera said. They should start with the Roth 401(k) and slowly move to the traditional as their income increases and the need for a deduction increases, he said. It could be a situation where they move 20% every three to five years from Roth to traditional.\n\nHedge your bets\n\nFor his part, Robert Westley, an associate wealth adviser at Northern Trust, said an optimal strategy may be to hedge your guesses about future tax rates and contribute to both a traditional and Roth 401(k). When deciding how to split the contributions, employees should aim to contribute to the deductible 401(k) until their marginal tax bracket falls to their anticipated tax bracket in retirement, he said.\n\nFor example, he said, for employees currently in the 39.6% tax bracket but with an expectation to be in the 33% tax bracket during retirement, contributions should be made to the deductible 401(k) until their taxable income lands them in the 33% bracket. It is important to keep in mind, however, that the combined contribution limit is set at $18,000, plus an additional $6,000 if age 50 or older, in 2017, Westley said.\n\nAccount diversification important\n\nAdvisers do emphasize the need to diversify your retirement accounts. Why so? Having money in all three types of retirement accounts gives you the best chance of creating tax-efficient income in retirement. We do like to see tax diversification, meaning having money in both tax-deferred (traditional 401(k)) and tax-free (Roth 401(k)) vehicles, said Adams Below. This helps provide for better tax planning during the withdrawal mode, and it helps with the risk of legislative changes related to how those accounts are taxed.\n\nOther advisers share this point of view. Once retired, if retirees have funds in a traditional 401(k), Roth 401(k) and HSA, they can effectively manage their tax bracket by making withdrawals in a tax-efficient manner, said Westley.\n\nThis strategy allows employees to control their effective tax rate by tapping tax-deferred accounts in their lower income tax years and tax-free accounts in their higher income tax years, he said. Ultimately, a mix of savings in both accounts will offer much-needed flexibility due to the uncertainty of future tax rates.\n\nHSA second or last?\n\nThe big debate among advisers seems to center on when to fund an HAS – as the first, second or third tranche. Some advisers, for instance, recommend funding your HSA after you've fully funded your traditional and Roth 401(k) accounts - assuming you have any money left over.\n\nOnce contribution limits (are) reached, employees, enrolled in an IRS-qualified high deductible health plan, should maximize contributions to an HSA, said Westley.\n\nSome advisers suggest funding the HSA last, but for different reasons. Since the HSA can only be used for medical expenses, we typically see it as the third priority, said Adams Belew. And it is important not to forget that saving to these accounts also often has to be balanced with saving for other priorities… Unfortunately, the answer is never simple.\n\nIt's not simple, but Dorsainvil and other advisers say savers should not overlook the triple tax benefit HSAs when funding retirements accounts: contributions reduce your taxable income for the respective tax year, withdrawals for qualified medical expenses comes out tax-free and should you need to use the funds after age 65 there is no tax penalty.\n\nRoth first, HSA second\n\nSome advisers, meanwhile, recommend an entirely different funding order. For his part, H. Jude Boudreaux, a certified financial planner and founder of Upperline Financial Planning, said Generation X and millenials, in a perfect world would contribute the maximum to their Roth 401(k) and their HSA. The younger and the lower your tax bracket, the less the Roth 401(k) hurts compared to the traditional 401k, and hopefully the longer they will have for the tax-free growth, he said.\n\nThe HSA is a bit trickier, but depending on their cash flow and savings it is equally critical, said Boudreaux. If a younger person has a high deductible plan and not much in savings, then I think the HSA moves up in priority to provide that cash cushion in the event of a health care emergency, he said.\n\nHSA for current or future expenses\n\nAdvisers also debate whether to fund an HSA for current medical or future expenses. One argument goes like this. If you have recurring medical expenses for contacts, dental, children than putting money in an HSA makes sense, said Douglas Duerr, a partner with Duerr & Duerr. But only put in what you really think you will use in a year. (There's) no reason to over fund this. The additional funds would be better set aside for retirement.\n\nBut another argument goes like this. The HSA was designed to be an IRA for future health-care costs. And if that's how you plan to use it, consider doing the following: Estimate your future health care costs and then calculate how much you need to save and earn to reach that goal. In 2015, for instance, a 65-year-old couple needed $259,000 set aside in savings to fund (at the 90% confidence level) Medigap premiums, Medicare Part B premiums, and out-of-pocket drug expenses for retirement, according Employee Benefit Research Institute.\n\nRead: Amount of Savings Needed for Health Expenses for People Eligible for Medicare: Unlike the Last Few Years, the News Is Not Good\n\nSo, let's say you're 35 now and need to accumulate about $631,000 over the next 30 years to fund retirement health care costs. (The $631,000 is an estimated future price tag for health-care costs in retirement in 30 years.) If that's the number, then you'd need to contribute the maximum possible to your HSA each and every year for the next 30 years. For 2017, the family maximum is $6,750 or $7,750 for those age 55 or older. The alternative, for what it's worth, would be to earmark a percent or dollar amount of your traditional or Roth 401(k) savings to pay for health care in retirement. But neither account — traditional or Roth — offers you a triple tax benefit as does the HSA.\n\nIt's a case-by-case thing\n\nTo be fair, advisers says the right funding order for you could be something entirely different. Every (person's) tax situation is different and changes annually, said Dorsainvil. Taking into account low marginal now versus high marginal later or vice versa should be taken into consideration, but a tax adviser once shared with me 'important not to let the tax tail wag the investment dog.'\n\nOthers agree. Employees, who have access to several employer-sponsored accounts, need to decide how to best allocate their contributions, said Westley. How to prioritize savings will ultimately depend on an employee's personal situation as well as his or her goals for retirement.\n\nRobert Powell is editor ofRetirement Weekly, published by MarketWatch.

If I were Marty McFly from Back to the Future, I would travel back and warn everyone against borrowing money from their future selves.\n\nDoes that sound crazy? Well, financial companies, the Federal Reserve, banks, and brokers all claim that they act in your best interests, yet your retirement statements prove otherwise. We are seeing the deepest gap ever between the haves and have-nots with savings erosion through COVID-19, a devastating recession, and lack of government support that has left people wondering who is serving their needs.\n\nRead: This bitcoin fund just went up over 1,000%. Beware\n\nThe lack of real interest in investing in the future by younger generations is due to the confusion caused in trying to put away for tomorrow by these traditional financial channels. Interest rates are near 0% from banks; there's no return to be had on bonds, all while things like rent, tuition cost keep climbing faster than the rate of inflation.\n\nThere are hopeful solutions that are not yet mainstream from financial technology companies that prove they can do better for the consumers in the fight for financial independence. Here are three steps anyone in their 20s can take immediately to make sure they have a chance to see retirement one day:\n\nUnderstand what it means to be 'financially free'\n\nTo save for your retirement, you must first understand what it means to be financially free. Financial freedom means preserving your capital, earning yield on the wealth you're creating, and budgeting for your savings to outlast your days on this planet. The goal of financial freedom is to get to the point where your monthly income is greater than your monthly expenses. When you're spending, you'll be spending against your own earned money and not against what you hope you'll earn in the future. When rates on deposits drop below the inflation rate it becomes impossible to save for the future and so one must invest in more risky assets or in non correlated assets to escape this impossible savings conundrum.\n\nRead: Worried about retirement? You'll find plenty of company here\n\nThe United States is a credit society: $922 billion in outstanding credit card debt pays a 24% average rate of interest back to the banks. Add $1.6 trillion in student loans and $1.2 trillion in car loan debt. We are being forced to borrow from our future selves at rates of 12% to 24% when we can barely earn 1% on our money from traditional financial institutions.\n\nHoping you choose to spend against your future earnings is what banks and credit card companies would like you to do, but this year has proven that borrowing from the future is unpredictable. When banks get you to borrow from your future self at 24% interest, they are grabbing someone else's dollars on which they pay them 0.1% to let you have instant gratification and spend now what you cannot afford otherwise.\n\nCan you see the dangerous trap here if you can't pay it back?\n\nThe current policies by the Federal Reserve also stifle retirement plans for the younger generation. Current approaches cause low or nonexistent income for most savers, and there is no indication of it getting better for the foreseeable future. Decades ago, with Social Security and a pension from an employer, a person could expect to sustain themselves in retirement. Now, too many people find themselves retiring with student loans, car loans, and more that make retirement difficult to realize.\n\nThink outside the banks\n\nStart asking yourself this every time you spend a dollar: Do I want to spend this dollar now, or do I want this dollar to earn for me for the rest of my life? Changing your overall mind-set of how money should be put to use can change your life.\n\nPutting your dollars to work through high-interest earning offers an alternative that revolutionizes how you can build your retirement plan.\n\nBoston College's Center for Retirement Research found that most people world-wide are what you'd call passive savers or people who pay little attention to tax incentives currently given by traditional financial policies. Instead, they adapt and adjust their spending to their take-home pay. This mentality makes the idea of saving and earning more responsive to initiatives like auto-enrolment.\n\nIf you put money away into an asset that is not linked to the USD or your local FIAT currency it will grow faster than inflation, if it also pays interest income on 35 different digital assets, such interest rates can be greater than inflation and get you closer and closer to financial independence each month. Add on top of that compounding interest and you have the trifecta of how to reach retirement. So here you are, we gave you the secret but unless you press the financial launch button nothing happens, you need to take action and put yourself on the right track for retirement.\n\nMany companies focused on financial freedom are cryptocurrency-based. The blockchain technology and community around it has a belief in helping users find financial freedom. You do not only have to invest in a 401(k) or IRA to save money. Although good options, you'll find that there are other ways to buy, save, and earn from assets like cryptocurrency, gold, and stablecoins to break free from what the Banks have long convinced us are the only options for saving.\n\nStop reading this, and start saving now\n\nCompounding interest is interest on your interest, your new dollars plus the original dollars calculated based on both the initial amount and the accumulated interest from previous periods.\n\nThere are many companies offering ways to begin earning for yourself, so start right out of high school or right after you read this. The banks have created an addictive model of spending and borrowing to earn and grow wealth through credit cards and rewards point programs. There are many blogs dedicated to hacking these programs, but just like in Las Vegas, the house always wins in the end.\n\nBy putting away the average cost of your credit card's monthly payment (around $123.88) in the right service, you can earn up to $420,000 after 20 years. With monthly earnings of nearly $20,000 by your 40s. A much better average monthly payout than Social Security provides at an average of $1,503 a month.\n\nJust as we looked to startups like Uber UBER, -4.23% and Facebook FB, +1.69% to revolutionize their industries, financial technology companies in blockchain are now mature enough to provide real alternatives. Services that can earn users up to 15% in interest a year. That isn't 24% owed to the banks for future income, that is your dollars earning for you — while you're at work, while you're asleep, and while you're focusing on your family or friends. The future of retirement is here and ready to help you be free.\n\nAlex Mashinsky is one of the inventors of VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) with a foundational patent dating back to 1994 and is now working on MOIP (Money Over Internet Protocol) technology.

Don't be fooled by the latest billionaire meeting at Trump Tower after which great progress in American job creation is claimed: Alibaba won't create 1 million jobs in the U.S. as promised, at least not directly.\n\nOn Monday, Alibaba BABA, +1.32% Chief Executive Jack Ma became, after a 40-minute meeting with Trump in the newly minted politician's gold-plated tower, the most recent CEO to tout job creation. There's no better music to President-elect Donald Trump's ears than pledges from CEOs to keep jobs in the U.S. or to create new ones. Trump based much of his campaign on ensuring U.S. jobs are kept away from foreigners and aren't outsourced to other countries, and he's gone to great and highly publicized lengths to prove his election is the reason for jobs coming to or staying in America.\n\n Alibaba CEO Jack Ma's assertion that he's going to create a million new jobs in the U.S. by helping small businesses sell products and services on China is a stretch. \n\nHowever, Ma's assertion that he's going to create a million new jobs in the U.S. by helping small businesses sell products and services to China is a stretch. The Chinese e-commerce giant is merely upping its own investments to appeal to U.S. small businesses, providing them with incentives, such as user data and logistics capabilities, in hope that more American brands will sell items on its e-commerce sites. The increased demand for those U.S. goods from the Chinese middle class will prompt, it hopes, increased hiring as U.S. brands expand to meet the heightened demand.\n\nThese aren't promises of traditional labor-force jobs that many Americans dream of when they listen to Trump's rhetoric on job creation. They're merely part of a publicity stunt that plays on Alibaba's previous announcements to expand its presence outside of China, particularly in the U.S.\n\nIt's like saying Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -3.44% , Etsy Inc. ETSY, -4.09% and eBay Inc. EBAY, -0.17% have all created millions, if not billions, of jobs through their respective marketplaces that connect third-party sellers to buyers. Sure, they're all platforms connecting sellers and buyers, which are necessary tools in a modern economy in which even tiny merchants wish to reach potential customers across the globe. But their actual full-time, with-benefits workforces are much tinier. Alibaba has fewer than 36,500 global employees despite notching in as one of the most valuable Chinese companies, with a market capitalization of $230 billion, according to FactSet. Amazon has 230,800 employees, while eBay has 11,600 and Etsy has fewer than 1,000.\n\nAlibaba's Jack Ma meets with Trump, vows to create U.S. jobs\n\nThe U.S. has long been an area of rising focus for Alibaba, particularly as the Hangzhou-headquartered company's stock continues to trade 20% below an all-time high reached more than two years ago. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed published on June 15, 2015, a week before Trump announced his candidacy for the presidency, Ma said Alibaba was focusing on the U.S. market, and he said helping U.S. brands connect to Chinese consumers would create American jobs and increase U.S. exports. Alibaba also specifically chose the U.S., rather than its home base of China, for its initial public offering.\n\nFrom the archives:Seven things to know about Alibaba's huge IPO\n\nOn Monday, with cameras capturing Ma and Trump in the marbled lobby of Trump Tower following their meeting — which they both characterized as great — Ma said he's going to work with the incoming administration to support 1 million small businesses in an efforts to sell products in China and Southeast Asia. Despite referring to that 1 million figure as representing U.S. jobs in an Alibaba blog post, neither Ma nor Trump elaborated on whether any of these would be full-time corporate jobs stationed in the U.S., or whether they'd simply be an outgrowth of the third-party network of sellers on Alibaba's e-commerce sites, many of whom likely also sell products on other e-commerce sites, such as Amazon and eBay.\n\nAn Alibaba spokesperson later confirmed to MarketWatch that these aren't corporate jobs.\n\nThis, of course, isn't the first time Trump has claimed responsibility for job creation without providing details on what those jobs are or offering transparency as to where they're coming from.\n\nIn November, Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.'s US:UTX decision to keep 1,000 Carrier factory jobs in the U.S. following CEO Greg Hayes's meeting with president-elect in his namesake tower. That necessitated a decade's worth of corporate tax incentives to be funded by Indiana taxpayers.\n\nIn December, he took credit for Sprint Corp.'s US:S decision to bring 5,000 jobs back to the U.S. from other countries, even though Sprint conceded the jobs were part of a previously announced commitment by Japan's SoftBank Group 9984, -1.73% to invest $50 billion in the U.S. and create 50,000 new jobs.\n\nSoftBank, which owns a controlling stake in Sprint, had announced that multibillion-dollar investment in the U.S. after a meeting with Trump earlier in December — however even that pledge was tied to an earlier announcement. SoftBank had struck a deal with Saudi Arabia in October to create a $100 billion tech fund with a focus on the U.S., according to the Wall Street Journal.
The government's partial shutdown is poised to put many taxpayers in tough spots.\n\nThis is the second-longest shutdown in 20 years — going on 5 weeks — and sparked by a disagreement between both parties to fund President Trump's proposed border wall. A partially closed government has the potential to affect nearly every facet of American lifestyles, including delaying package deliveries and air travel. Federal employees are also at risk of missing credit-card payments or paying their rent or mortgage bills — about 420,000 people could end up working without pay.\n\nSee:No end in sight for government shutdown: 'You have to have a wall,' Trump says\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service is one agency currently strained. Less than half (43.5%) of the agency's roughly 80,000 workers are expected to work at the beginning of this year, under the IRS's contingency plan. (Before the end of 2018, only 12.5% of the workforce were working). Their jobs will include designing and printing upcoming tax forms, overseeing electronic returns processed through the system, continuing IRS computer operations to prevent loss of data and conducting criminal investigations.\n\nThe IRS did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nStill, fewer employees will affect taxpayers and tax professionals preparing for the 2019 return filing season, which is widely expected to begin at the end of the month.\n\nHere's where taxpayers are at risk:\n\nDelayed refunds\n\nThe IRS will continue to accept returns, as well as tax payments, but it won't issue refunds during the shutdown. The impact this will have on taxpayers during the 2019 tax season will be significant if the shutdown extends for the next few weeks, but could even affect some taxpayers now — primarily, individuals who filed amended returns and businesses who have unique filing deadlines, said Tim Steffen, the director of advanced planning at financial-services firm Baird.\n\nThe last government shutdown, in January 2018, lasted only two days and did not affect taxpayers. But the one prior, which happened in 2013 under the Obama administration, went on for 16 days and caused $2.2 billion in delayed refunds to individuals and another $1.5 billion to businesses. More than 90% of IRS workers were furloughed, meaning they were not working under the shutdown.\n\nFor some Americans, tax refunds are critical to their financial well-being. Most Americans use refunds to pay off their credit cards or student loans, or pad their savings accounts. Others take trips or put the money toward their personal goals, like a fairy tale wedding or a dream home.\n\nBut many Americans also spend their tax refund — almost immediately — on their health. Health care spending typically rises 60% the week following a tax refund, according to J.P. Morgan Chase Institute, especially for cash-strapped families who can't afford out-of-pocket medical expenses.\n\nNo transcripts for loans\n\nHomebuyers might have a harder time getting proof of income for their home-loan applications. Lenders typically require a transcript, administered by the IRS and called Form 4506-T, which verifies income for potential homebuyers. Under a government shutdown, the only transcripts the IRS will issue are those related to disaster relief efforts, according to the contingency plan.\n\nTaxpayers who work for big companies may not have too much of an issue, if a bank or other lender is willing to accept W-2 forms the company has filed. But that might not work for everyone, Steffens said, especially given how easy it has become to forge documents. Potential homebuyers who are also self-employed or retired might find trouble without a transcript, which could lead to a delay in the home buying or finding other methods of proof.\n\nThe good news: If someone in need of a transcript already has a tax professional named with a power of attorney, that tax professional can retrieve a transcript without waiting for the IRS through an online portal for practitioners, said Harvey Bezozi, founder of Your Financial Wizard, a tax consulting firm in Boca Raton, Fla. To give a tax professional a power of attorney would cost time and money, however.\n\nAlso see:What a government shutdown could mean for stock market\n\nUnanswered questions\n\nIRS call sites are also unavailable during the shutdown. Taxpayers call service centers when they have questions related to filing returns or receiving refunds. Contacting the IRS has always been difficult, with many people often put on hold for a while, Steffen said. You won't even get that nowadays, he said. It can be harder to get answers from calling the IRS right now. Practitioners will also face issues — the Practitioner Priority Service, a support line for tax professionals, was not accepting calls on Friday either.\n\nOther agency responsibilities not supported in a government shutdown include legal counsel, service center processing (such as data transcription, error resolution or coding) and planning, training or development activities within the agency.\n\nPaused audits and exams\n\nTaxpayers may welcome one impact of the shutdown: Audits and exams have been put on hold.\n\nPeople are chosen for audits when an IRS software program randomly selects the taxpayer or when that person is linked to someone else, like a family member or business partner, being audited. The agency can audit returns up to three years old, and inaccuracies or falsehoods could lead to fees or, in more serious cases, criminal charges of tax evasion or fraud.\n\nEven with a fully staffed agency, however, the IRS audited less than 1% of returns in 2017, and that figure expected to be lower in 2018.\n\nBut taxpayers who anticipated an audit shouldn't get too excited, Bezozi said. Audits may be delayed a few weeks, or even months, but they won't be forgotten. If someone is going to be audited and has a legitimate issue, it would be delayed, but eventually they'll be audited anyway, he said.
The dollar's strength against most major currencies is featuring prominently this earnings season and is being blamed for a slew of revenue misses that promise more trouble ahead.\n\nOn Tuesday alone, Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.17% , Procter & Gamble Co. PG, -0.60% , DuPont Co. DD, +1.12% , Coach Inc. US:COH, Corning Inc. GLW, +2.44% and Freeport-McMoRan Inc. FCX, +1.49% all missed revenue estimates for the December quarter.\n\n3M Co. MMM, +1.58% beat, but revenue fell 5.4% from the year-earlier period. AK Steel Holding Corp. US:AKS also beat, but its revenue was down 23%.\n\nRead:Fears of recession in industrial sector grow as pessimism deepens\n\nThe dollar has gained 2.4% in the last three months, as measured by the ICE dollar index, boosted by the Federal Reserve's interest-rate hike in mid-December. That strength means reduced sales for U.S. companies when money is repatriated from a country with a weaker currency. Dollar strength was repeatedly invoked in the first three earnings seasons of 2015 as a major headwind, with many companies making extra disclosures that attempted to strip out its effect.\n\nInvestors don't like worrying about currency volatility; they would strongly prefer to leave it as a small line item on the income statement, said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex, a global brokerage company based in New York. With the volatility in China's currency, not to mention other emerging markets, it is now an unwelcomed and front-of-mind topic.\n\nThe S&P 500 is on track for its fourth straight season of negative sales, according to FactSet data, the longest such negative streak since the four-quarter stretch from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the third quarter of 2009. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.40% has fallen 7% in the last 12 months.\n\nSo far, 17.3% of S&P 500 companies have reported, and the index is looking at a median decline in sales of 3.5%, according to FactSet. That's the data provider's blended growth rate, which includes those companies that have reported as well as the estimates for the rest.\n\nApple Inc. AAPL, -2.16% , the world's biggest company by market cap, is scheduled to report after the bell, and investors are bracing for its first-ever decline in sales of the iPhone.\n\nRead: Dollar is Public Enemy No. 1 this earnings season\n\nProfit, as measured by per-share earnings, is faring even worse. The S&P 500 is on track for a 5.9% decline in earnings per share, according to FactSet.\n\nOf course, the dollar is not the only factor denting this season's earnings. The slowdown in China is expected to weigh on all those companies that now sell a large amount of their products to the Chinese consumer.\n\nRead: Oil price slump sends U.S. distress ratio to heights not seen since Great Recession\n\nAnd: Moody's may downgrade 120 oil and gas companies, 55 mining companies\n\nThe slumping commodity markets are battering energy and mining companies.

The materials sector is expected to fall 14%.\n\nDon't miss: 5 troubling headwinds expected to show up this earnings season\n\nHere are some of the comments companies made about the dollar today:\n\nDuPont Chief Financial Officer Nicholas Fanandakis: We expect net sales to be down low single digits versus prior year due to the impact of currency and continued challenges in agriculture and emerging markets. Currency will continue to impact the top line, as the dollar strengthens against most currencies, primarily the euro and the Brazilian real. Excluding currency, sales would be about even with prior year. The company expects 2016 operating earnings of $2.95 to $3.10 per share on flat sales excluding currency.\n\nP&G CFO Jon R. Moeller: Currencies are weakening across the board, more than $0.75 billion since the start of the fiscal and over $1 billion after tax versus year-ago. This is on top of the $1.5 billion impact last fiscal year and nearly a $1 billion impact the year before. Across three years, FX has been a $3.5 billion impact, over 30% of fiscal year 2013 core net earnings after tax. Since the start of December, the current-year FX headwind has increased by $300 million after tax, with a 40% devaluation in Argentina, an additional 15% devaluation in Russia, and nearly a 10% devaluation in Mexico.\n\nThe relative strength of the dollar weighs heavier on us than our euro and yen functional currency competitors. The dollar has more than doubled against the ruble over the past two years, while our euro functional competitors are facing about 50% to 60% of that impact. We expect these dynamics, slowing market growth, geopolitical hot spots, and a stronger dollar, will continue to be part of our reality going forward.\n\nJohnson & Johnson CFO Dominic Caruso: Now turning to earnings, a continuing factor impacting earnings guidance for 2016 is the impact of currency movements on transactions, which although hedged, is still somewhat negative. We expect transaction currency impacts to negatively impact our gross margin by approximately 60 to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared with 2015.\n\nWe would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $6.53 to $6.68 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth rates of 5% to 8%. Again, we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS with the euro at 109, our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.10 per share. Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS would range from $6.43 to $6.58 per share. At this early stage in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range, which, at approximately 5%, is higher than current consensus estimates.
ADT Inc.'s shares got off to a shaky start Friday, after an initial public offering that gives investors the opportunity to buy shares in a company familiar to many Americans, thanks to the common sight of its blue octagonal logo on residential burglar alarms across the nation.\n\nBoca Raton, Fla.–based ADT priced its IPO at $14 late Thursday, well below its targeted range of $17 to $19, to raise about $1.6 billion. Shares started trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ADT, and promptly fell 10.5%.\n\nMorgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, RBC, Citigroup, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse were joint bookrunning managers on the deal, with eight other firms acting as co-managers.\n\nProceeds will be used to redeem debt, as well for the catchall general corporate purposes, which includes growth initiatives, according to ADT.\n\nApollo Global Management APO, -1.56% , which took the company private in February 2016 in a $6.9 billion leveraged buyout, continues to own the majority of the shares, making ADT a controlled company under NYSE rules. That means Apollo continues to call the shots.\n\nSee also: Why you need smart security for your smart home\n\nApollo funded the deal partly by issuing preferred shares and warrants to an affiliate of the privately held Koch Industries Inc., for an aggregate $750 million, meaning the noted conservative political donors the Koch brothers also own a stake. The controlled-company status also exempts ADT from certain corporate-governance requirements.\n\nHere are five things to know about ADT:\n\nIt has roots in the 19th century\n\nADT was created in 1874 as American District Telegraph, harnessing what was the leading communications technology of the time. From there, the company advanced to the call box, a system that allowed signals to be transmitted by a watchman to alert the police, say, or the fire department of the need for assistance. In the 1900s, the company came under the control of AT&T T, -0.46% , starting its switch to the signal business that was the first iteration of its security service. In 1940, it introduced the ultrasonic burglar alarm along with a fire-detection system. In 1969, the company went public for the first time on the NYSE.\n\nIt's a big player in its market\n\nADT, which has grown through acquisitions, including most recently of Protection One and ASG, describes itself as the leading provider of security and monitoring services in the U.S. and Canada. The company estimates that it's about five times bigger than the next largest residential alarm competitor, Vivint Home Security, measured by revenue, with a roughly 30% market share.\n\nA 2017 survey found the ADT name had about 95% brand awareness, according to the company's prospectus. It serves about 7.2 million residential and business customers and has the biggest sales, installation and service field force of any security company, supported by its roughly 18,000 employees.\n\n2017 numbers are not yet available — and won't be ahead of the IPO\n\nADT has not yet completed its financial results for 2017 and can only offer potential investors a set of expectations. The numbers were not available before the IPO is completed, and that also means it cannot provide an update on what the tax bill that was signed into law in December means for its NOL (net operating loss) carryforwards, deferred tax assets that would normally help reduce its tax bill.\n\nOur net deferred tax assets and liabilities will be revalued at the newly enacted U.S. corporate rate, and the impact will be recognized in our tax expense for the taxable year beginning Jan. 1, 2018, says the prospectus.\n\nThat could mean a hit to earnings, but the extent won't be clear until audited financials are available.\n\nThe company is expecting 2017 revenue of up to $4.3 billion, according to its preliminary estimates. Net income is expected to come to $550.8 million, and EBTIDA is expected at $2.37 billion. The company says it benefits from a stable revenue profile, with more than 90% of its revenue coming from recurring, contractually committed monthly payments under contracts that typically have initial terms of three to five years.\n\nThe company may have exposure to a surprising liability\n\nOne of the risk factors mentioned in the prospectus is the company's liability for obligations of the Brink's Co., thanks to its acquisition of a business formerly owned by Brink's called Broadview Security. That business is subject to the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992, meaning it must cover the costs of health-care coverage for retired workers suffering from coal-related ailments.\n\nBrink's has created a Voluntary Employee's Beneficiary Association trust to cover those liabilities, and Brink's has agreed to indemnify the business for any and all liabilities stemming from its former coal operations. However, if Brink's and the trust are unable to satisfy all such obligations, we could be held liable, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, says the prospectus.\n\nADT has a lot of debt and a unique non-GAAP metric to go with it\n\nADT's 2016 LBO has left it saddled with more than $10 billion in debt, and its estimated debt service cost for 2017 was $650 million. The company also has a $772 million obligation in the Koch preferred securities, as well as a dividend obligation of an estimated $84 million for 2017.\n\nThat means it is important for the company to meet its EBITDA and cash-flow targets to ensure it is able to service debt and remain in compliance with covenants. That in turn could limit its ability to incur further indebtedness or to make acquisitions or pay dividends.\n\nDon't miss:Here are the ways Google and Amazon are fighting\n\nADT offers Covenant Adjusted EBTIDA as one of the many non-GAAP numbers included in its prospectus (ones not prepared in compliance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the regulatory standard).\n\nSee now:Paint your bathroom this color and boost your home's selling price by $5,400\n\nCIO Network: IoT Devices Vulnerable to Cyberattacks\n\nWe believe that the presentation of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about our ability to operate our business in compliance with the restrictions set forth in our debt agreements and is a component of compensation measures for our executives by supplementing GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies, states the prospectus.\n\nApollo shares were down 2.7% Friday, but have surged 64% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% has gained 24% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% has risen 32%.\n\nRead on:Why you may not need to worry about the new marijuana dispensary next door
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said Thursday that it will use savings from the tax bill signed into law in December to reward its workers with extra pay, and even offer one-time $1,000 bonuses—but only employees with at least 20 years of service will qualify.\n\nThe retail giant said it will increase the starting wage for hourly associates to $11, effective during the Feb. 17, 2018 pay cycle. Economists and campaigners for a living wage have argued that workers need at least $15 an hour to cover their living costs.\n\nWal-Mart WMT, -1.31% previously announced wage increases in 2016. Target Corp. TGT, +0.68% raised its minimum wage to $11 in 2017, and says it will go up to $15 in three years.\n\nStates have also responded. San Francisco's minimum wage rate will rise to $15 on July 1, 2018. New York and Seattle are also planning to raise their minimum wage to $15 over time.\n\nA number of companies including Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +2.43% , AT&T Inc. T, -0.46% and Southwest Airlines Co. LUV, -1.34% have offered wage boosts or bonuses in response to the tax bill.\n\nRead:5 blue-collar jobs that pay $100,000 a year\n\nWal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon announced the move in a memo posted on the company blog that the tax changes give the company an opportunity to accelerate a few pieces of planned investments.\n\nCan boxed water compete against bottled water?\n\nWe are early in the stages of assessing the opportunities tax reform creates for us to invest in our customers and associates and to further strengthen our business, all of which should benefit our shareholders, said McMillon in a separate statement.\n\nSee also:Here's what all 30 companies that make up the Dow industrials think about the tax cuts\n\nAnd: 'It just makes sense' to replace workers with machines, Jack in the Box CEO says\n\nWal-Mart has also expanded paid maternity leave to 10 weeks and will offer six paid weeks of parental leave to full-time hourly associates. Salaried employees will get six weeks of paid parental leave as well. Finally, the retail giant will provide a benefit of $5,000 for full-time hourly and salaried associates to help with adoption fees.\n\nThe benefits are expected to impact one million workers.\n\nWal-Mart expects the cost of the wage increase to be $300 million incremental to what's included in its next fiscal year plan. And about $400 million will be applied to the current fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2018 for the bonus payments.\n\nWal-Mart will provide additional details when quarterly results are released on Feb. 20. The company did not immediately respond to questions about how many workers have 20 years of service.\n\nMoody's calls the new benefits announcement a credit positive deployment of money.\n\nInvesting in employees is beneficial on multiple fronts, including reductions in turnover, as well as potentially enhancing the store experience for customers, which in the current shifting retail environment, is critical for any brick-and-mortar retailer, said Charlie O'Shea, Moody's lead retail analyst.\n\nRead:Wal-Mart to cut about 10,000 jobs as it shuts 10% of Sam's Club stores
Indexing strategies have been the fastest-growing segment of the asset-management industry in the past 15 years because of low fees, tax efficiency, diversification and the failure of high-fee active fund managers to justify those higher fees.\n\nAs this trend plays out, we're hearing more stories about how it's bad for investors and how we need these old, high-fee active managers to better manage assets.\n\nThe latest story about the inevitable day of reckoning due to index funds comes from hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. Ackman's flagship hedge fund has failed to outperform the benchmark S&P 500 Index by a wide margin in the past few years, and his 2015 annual letter blamed index funds for some of the troubles. How much of this is true, though? Let's explore some of Ackman's comments in more detail.\n\nFirst, we should note that much of the confusion in this debate stems from the mythical distinction between active and passive investing. As I've noted many times before, the market is composed entirely of active participants whose level of activity ranges from silly (high-fee day trading, for instance) to intelligent (your typical Boglehead-type of approach often referred to as passive indexing). Since the market is made up of one portfolio of all outstanding global financial assets, and all market participants deviate from this global cap-weighted portfolio, then the distinction between active (those who try to beat the market) and passive (those who try to capture the market return) is far murkier than most would have you believe.\n\nThis distinction is important to understand because the rise of less-active investors creates greater opportunities for more-active managers. This is due to the fact that a passive product requires active management. For every passive investor who doesn't want to waste time and money buying every stock in a stock index fund, there is a more-active manager or market maker ensuring that that product trades at the net asset value that that less-active investor desires.\n\nIndeed, passive investors pay active investors in various forms (spreads, market-data fees, arbitrage, etc.) for owning their less-active product. Some active managers such as high-frequency trading firms and other market makers have made gobs of money during the rise of index funds due to the efficient way in which they make the indexing process operate. There is no clear distinction between active and passive investing because passive investing necessarily requires an active manager just like a market requires both a buyer and a seller.\n\nBut let's move on to some of Ackman's claims.\n\nAre index funds causing high valuations? Ackman says index funds are causing unusually high valuations in some stock indices:\n\nAs more and more capital flows to index funds — and certain index funds such as those tracking the S&P 500 receive disproportionate amounts of investor capital — the valuation of the indexed constituent companies increases. While some investors consider the valuation of the index components when allocating to specific index funds, many and perhaps most do not. We would expect that many if not most investors picked an index fund when they signed up for their 401(k) plans and never looked back.\n\nIndex funds are a growing segment of the world, but this thinking implies that index funds are now the marginal price setter of the market. This might be becoming increasingly true, but as of 2015 index funds were still a relatively small piece of all asset managers at just 34%. Bear in mind, much of this money is simply index funds inside of active strategies. (See the rise of the many tactical asset allocation ETFs, for instance.) The annual turnover of the 100 largest ETFs is 864%, which shows that ETFs are far more active than most people think.\n\nMore importantly, even if index funds are influencing valuations, then this should create more opportunities for more active managers. After all, if Ackman thinks the U.S. markets are overvalued and that the tide is essentially lifting all boats, then one has to wonder why he has any exposure to U.S. markets in the first place. The purpose of a more active strategy is to find slices of the market that won't expose investors to systemic risk. This is what the higher fees are supposed to justify, after all. If the more-active investor can't expose those uncorrelated corners of the market, then one has to wonder what purpose the manager is serving in the first place.\n\nFurther, Ackman's comments about U.S. stocks and index funds are a fallacy of composition. After all, the rise of index funds is a global phenomenon and many global markets (like emerging markets) have become quite attractive in relative value terms over the past 10 years when compared with U.S. stocks. Savvy managers should be able to exploit the attractive valuations in parts of the world where valuations have declined substantially, but despite the supposed upward pressure from indexing, many of these foreign markets have appeared more like value traps than anything else.\n\nDo index funds create a lack of governance? Ackman asserts that the growth in indexing will lead to less shareholder involvement in corporate management. He says:\n\nWhile index fund managers are, of course, fiduciaries for their investors, the job of overseeing the governance of the tens of thousands of companies for which they are major shareholders is an incredibly burdensome and almost impossible job.\n\nThe reason indexing has become so prominent is because there is tremendous evidence proving that the market allocates capital better than more-active high-fee managers. The rise of indexing is consistent with the view that the market does not believe people like Bill Ackman know more about a corporation than the people who run that corporation. I find it rather odd that so many hedge fund managers believe they know more about corporations than the people who have spent their lives running and building those corporations.\n\nFurther, the data above showing index funds as a share of total assets in index funds proves that index funds don't control corporate America. They are, at best, still a minority participant. And more importantly, the rise of short-termism has coincided perfectly with the growth in activist hedge funds because most of these funds have time horizons that are much shorter than corporations would prefer. An asset manager literally cannot think long-term like a corporation because they are judged by their annual returns. Hedge funds will never have a truly long-term time horizon. They will necessarily do what is in the best interests of the short term because they must impose their short-term needs on firms. Perhaps this isn't true of Ackman's firm, but it is certainly true of active managers in general.\n\nIs indexing turning the U.S. into Japan? Ackman's most outrageous claim is that indexing might turn America into Japan:\n\nIf the index fund trend continues, and it looks likely to do so, what happens when index funds control Corporate America? Courts have often deemed shareholders to be in control of a corporation with as little as 20% of the ownership of a company. At current rates of asset inflows, it will not be long before index funds effectively control Corporate America and the corporations of many foreign countries. The Japanese system of cross corporate ownership, the keiretsu, has been blamed for decades of Japanese corporate underperformance and economic malaise. Large passive ownership of Corporate America by index funds risks a similar outcome without the counterbalancing force of large active investors and improvements in the governance oversight implemented by passive index fund managers.\n\nIf index funds control corporate America, then more of these high-fee active managers will stop pretending that they know more about corporations than the great entrepreneurs who built those businesses. But more importantly, the stock market is not the economy. Japan's economy is not suffering because there is a dearth of activist managers to help guide Japanese corporations to success. The Japanese economy is suffering primarily because they have an insurmountable demographic problem.\n\nIndexing isn't eating hedge fund returns. As I noted recently, it's high fees that are eating hedge fund returns. In fact, if you look at Ackman's own shareholder letter, you'll notice that one of the biggest things eating returns are the high fees. The gross return of 37.3% over the past three years was cut nearly in half due to fees, which reduce it to just 22.2%!\n\nAckman and other hedge funds would do better by their shareholders if they reduced their fees rather than blaming low-fee index funds for their inability to identify pockets of the market that will generate better returns.\n\nCullen Roche is the founder of Orcam Financial Group LLC, a financial-services firm that offers low-fee asset-management, private-advisory, institutional-consulting and educational services.

You've spent your whole life saving for retirement . Now you're finished working, and it's time to start spending what you've saved. For many investors, the transition can be confusing or even traumatic. How will you tap your portfolio?\n\nAs investors approach this transition from saving to spending they should take three steps: start with a retirement income plan, keep their portfolio invested and diversified, and then rebalance their portfolio periodically to generate the cash they require. Here we'll discuss the last step — creating your paycheck when rebalancing.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nIf you're an investor, you've almost certainly heard of having an appropriate asset allocation to stocks and bonds, maybe 60% stocks and 40% bonds, and then periodically rebalancing. Some investments rise and others fall at different times under different market conditions. To stay on track, rebalancing helps keep your portfolio in balance based on your goals and tolerance for risk.\n\nFewer investors think of rebalancing as a retirement income strategy. A lot of investors try to construct a retirement income check from investment earnings alone, but it isn't necessary — or most efficient. You'd need a portfolio of $2,000,000, for example, invested in the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% today to generate $40,000 in dividend income. For many people a more feasible strategy is to consider a diversified investment approach instead — and rebalance.\n\nWhen it comes to retirement, 60s are the new 50s\n\nHow do I do it?\n\nConsider John and Jane. They've been diligent savers and have built a solid balance to tap now that they've decided to retire. They've worked with a financial adviser, and determined that they'll likely have a long life in retirement. They have $1 million saved — to round off the numbers and make it easy — and want to start retirement by tapping $40,000 from their portfolio before taxes along with Social Security and other income.\n\nJohn and Jane start with mix of cash, bonds, and stocks recommended by their adviser. They're in their mid-60s, and this mix of investments feels comfortable to them. A year from now, they plan to take their first portfolio withdrawal. Today, their portfolio looks like this:\n\nHypothetical portfolio – John and Jane\n\nSource: Schwab Center for Financial Research. Hypothetical for illustration only. Your asset allocation likely will differ depending on your time horizon, risk tolerance, and other factors.\n\nAfter a year in the market, what happens? Let's imagine that the portfolio performed reasonably well, as shown below:\n\nNote: Returns illustrated are one-year returns, hypothetical for illustration only.\n\nThere are two nice attributes of interest and dividends: one, most portfolios generate them, and two, they're always positive. However, they might not be enough to generate the income you need. For John and Jane, portfolio growth boosted their return, which provides a third portfolio income stream in addition to what they're getting from interest and dividends. This may not happen every year. But on average, we expect that a diversified portfolio will grow over time.\n\nNow that we see how their portfolio performed, how do they generate the cash they need? They rebalance, as shown below:\n\nNote: Returns illustrated are one-year returns, hypothetical for illustration only.\n\nIn this case, John and Jane chose to invest using mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). They opted to automatically reinvest the distributions they received. At the end of the year, John and Jane rebalanced and sold shares to generate the $40,000 they needed.\n\nWhat else could you consider?\n\n• Interest and dividends vs. selling shares? John and Jane could have chosen to have interest and dividends transferred to a bank account first, and then sell shares if needed. For example, if they received $20,000 in interest and dividend payments — equal to 2% yield from their $1 million — they'd only need another $20,000 more from their portfolio. It can be easier, though, just to reinvest and keep the money working. This can also make the paperwork easier.\n\n• Tapping principal? Some investors look at rebalancing and selling investments as tapping principal. Think of it instead as tapping all sources of return from your portfolio. Using John and Jane's scenario, they didn't tap any of their original $1 million principal, they simply used the portfolio gains as additional portfolio income.\n\n• Down market? The risk of a down market is critical to retirees. Early in retirement, a big drop in your portfolio can be particularly damaging. A diversified portfolio with the right mix of cash, high-quality bonds, and stocks helps with diversification, but it's not a guarantee that your portfolio won't lose value. In a down market, consider cutting discretionary expenses, if you can. Do this, and you'll limit the need to sell investments in a down market.\n\n• What about taxes? Consider the tax implications of withdrawing income from your portfolio. For example, it typically makes sense to avoid selling any shares purchased within the last 12 months to limit short-term capital-gains tax treatment. Earnings withdrawn from a traditional IRA or 401(K) are taxed as ordinary income. Withdrawals from Roth IRAs or Roth 401(K) are not taxed at all.\n\nA critical mistake people can make when it comes to retirement income planning is limiting their strategy to interest and dividends and neglecting the power of rebalancing to capture portfolio growth as an additional income source. And in addition to helping you take a more holistic approach to generating income, it has the added benefit of forcing a good habit of regularly rebalancing your portfolio back to its intended asset allocation based on your goals, time horizon and risk tolerance — an important fundamental of successful investing and one that's even more critical for people approaching or in retirement.\n\nRob Williams, CFP, CRPC, is managing director, Income Planning, for Schwab Center for Financial Research.\n\nDisclosure: The information provided here is for general informational purposes only and should not be considered an individualized recommendation or personalized investment advice.

Hurt by the collapse in energy prices and the strength of the U.S. dollar, manufacturing's up in flames. The Federal Reserve no longer sees risks to the economy as balanced. Corporate earnings are declining, and worse, executives are more pessimistic about the future.\n\nAmerican Express went so far as to cut its profit guidance for 2017. At the beginning of 2016.\n\nSo the real puzzle may be why the jobs market still looks pretty good.\n\nThe latest numbers for those filing for the first time for unemployment benefits, out Thursday, defied all the commentary around it. Jobless claims fell 16,000, hardly the kind of number consistent with Corporate America telling workers to take a hike.\n\nClaims data, to be fair, can be erratic. But other jobs indicators also are looking healthy. Payrolls climbed by 292,000 in December. A measure of service companies' desires to hire was a very solid 55.7%, well above the 50% mark indicating expansion.\n\nEconomists at Barclays point out this claims report has special significance because it was conducted in the same week that the government does its measurement for the nonfarm payrolls report. The Barclays economists note that continuing claims were higher than during the survey week for December; however, almost half the rise comes from California, impacted by a rise in agricultural claims, which don't, by definition, make it into the nonfarm payrolls report. The remainder of the claims rise, relative to December, is concentrated in states like Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, where the manufacturing industry's troubles are impacting.\n\nIn a nutshell, it looks like the January employment report (due Feb. 5) will be pretty good, based on what is currently known.\n\nThere are a couple of competing explanations.\n\nOne is, simply, companies haven't gotten around to layoffs. Yet. The labor market is famously a lagging indicator, so, well, it may just be lagging.\n\nThe other is that corporate pessimism needs to be put in perspective. The outlook for consumers is pretty good, with plenty of cheap gas and a lot less debt hanging over their heads. Not surprisingly, consumer confidence has been pretty decent, recently hitting a three-month high.\n\nAnother, related point is that while corporate margins may be headed the wrong way, they're still pretty good. According to FactSet Research, the trailing 12-month net margin of S&P 500 companies is 9.8%, which is above the 8.8% average over the last decade.\n\nQuarterly margins of 9.9% are set to be the lowest since the first quarter of 2014, but from there are projected to begin an upward march, to 11% by the first quarter of 2017.\n\nOK, we all know Wall Street analysts and their rose-tinted glasses, but the margins of America's largest companies are pretty good and may well get better from here.\n\nA broader look on corporate margins can be taken from the report on gross domestic product. Alas, the first read of fourth-quarter numbers, due Friday, won't include the latest data. But the ratio of domestic after-tax profits to the net value added of corporate business (a crude way if imprecise way of saying revenue) was 15.9% in the third quarter — well above the 9.9% median over the last 50 years.\n\nFrom the perspective of the stock market, no investors want to see sagging margins. But from the perspective of the economy — and of corporate managers — it looks like times are still pretty good.\n\nSo maybe that's why corporate gloom and doom isn't being matched by a wave of pink slips.
U.S. stocks finished higher Tuesday as investors focused on a pair of runoff elections in Georgia, given the possibility of a more aggressive fiscal policy to combat the coronavirus pandemic should the Democrats win control of the Senate.\n\nInvestors were also monitoring the spread of COVID-19 as a more transmissible variant of the pathogen leads to stiffer lockdowns in parts of the world which resulted in a poor start to the year for stocks on Monday.\n\nOn Monday, stocks fell to start trade in 2021, with the Dow, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite falling more than 1%. The Dow and S&P saw their sharpest daily drops in almost 10 weeks.\n\nSee: How does the stock market perform after a 1% drop — or worse — to start a year?\n\nWhat's driving the market?\n\nIn Georgia, Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are facing off against Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, but the results may not be known for several days.\n\nBetting markets and polls were signaling some confidence in the Democratic Party's prospects which could result in some repeal of corporate tax reductions and other measures that could weigh on stocks, market strategists said. However, a Democratic win also could lead to another large round of economic aid to boost the economy.\n\nIf the Democrats win both runoff elections in Georgia this would open the door to a large fiscal stimulus package and more expansive fiscal policy in the coming years. Part of this will likely be financed by higher taxes somewhere down the road, said Philip Marey, senior U.S. strategist at Rabobank, in a note.\n\nRead: Biden says Democratic wins in Georgia's runoffs will lead to $2,000 stimulus checks\n\nIf Republicans win at least one of the seats, Senate Republicans will likely block further fiscal stimulus and crimp any Democratic plans for expansive spending after President-elect Joe Biden takes office, Marey said.\n\nConsequently, there will be more pressure on the Fed to provide monetary stimulus during the course of 2021 if the economic recovery falters, he wrote.\n\nRepublicans currently have a 51-48 majority in the Senate. If Democrats win both Georgia races, the party will gain control because Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast tiebreaking votes. If Republicans win one of them, the GOP will maintain its majority.\n\nAs we stated yesterday, the chances of the Democrat's taking control of the Senate in a tied majority scenario have risen, wrote Peter Cardillo, chief market strategist at Spartan Capital Securities. However, while we expect the GOP to maintain control by slim margin the political uncertainties will likely keep the market defensive, he wrote.\n\nThe vote comes as the U.S. counted at least 196,386 new COVID-19 cases on Monday, and at least 2,047 people died, according to a New York Times tracker. Meanwhile, A highly contagious strain of COVID-19 recently discovered in the U.K. also has been found in California and other parts of the U.S., including New York, after the U.K. on Monday announced a new, stricter lockdown in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate development that might have implications for U.S.-listed China stocks, the New York Stock Exchange reversed its decision to delist a trio of Chinese stocks: China Mobile Ltd., China Telecom Corp. and China Unicom Ltd. The NYSE's delisting plans, which had been set to take effect next week, followed an order that had been signed by President Donald Trump in November.\n\nIn U.S. economic data, the Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index rose to 60.7% in December from 57.5% in the prior month, marking the highest level in almost 2½ years. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had forecast the index to total 57%. Readings over 50% indicate growth.\n\nCleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester told reporters Tuesday that the central bank could continue its $120 billion per-month asset purchases through all of 2021 even if the economy improves in the second half of the year.\n\nEnergy stocks SP500.10, +0.94% were a highlight Tuesday with the sector up 4.5%, the biggest one-day jump since Dec. 4, after Saudi Arabia agreed to voluntary production cuts in February and March. Chevron CVX, +0.36% rose 2.7%.\n\nWhich companies are in focus?\n\nWhat are other markets doing?
You might not be in Kansas anymore — if you ever lived to begin with — but the city of Topeka wants to change that.\n\nLocal officials in Kansas's capital city have approved a measure that would pay people up to $10,000 to move to the city and rent, and $15,000 to move there and purchase a home, the Kansas City Star reported.\n\nThe Choose Topeka program is a match of public funds and employer money. It's meant to cover moving costs and make the idea of putting down roots more appealing in the city, population 125,904.\n\nParticipants will get the money after living one year in the city or surrounding area, which has attractions like the Evel Knievel museum, a zoo, nature trails, and a stately capitol building.\n\nInitial funding will cover the costs to help bring in 40 to 60 new residents, according to an announcement of the program.\n\nThe program is meant to support local business efforts to attract and retain talented workers, but we also intend to showcase just how much Topeka and Shawnee County supports its local talent and is crusading for them to reach that next step in their pathway to success and happiness within the community, said Molly Howey, senior vice president, economic development, in the Greater Topeka Partnership, an umbrella organization focused on the community's development.\n\nWhile Topeka gets its program underway, other places in America and across the globe are already trying to entice new residents with cash and other perks. Here's a look at some other spots that would love to have you think about living there.\n\nTulsa, Okla.\n\nTulsa, Okla. announced a program last year that will pay people up to $10,000 to move there. Like plans in Topeka, the Tulsa program requires people to reside a year before they receive any cash. Tulsa's offering gives program participants free membership to a co-working space in the city.\n\nWe are looking for talented and energetic people who not only will consider relocating permanently to Tulsa but especially for people who want to make something happen here — to add to the dynamism, idealism and get 'er done spirit of Tulsa. Ken Levit, executive director of George Kaiser Family Foundation, previously said.\n\nAntikythera, Greece\n\nAntikythera, an island in the Aegean Sea between Crete and mainland Greece, boasts picturesque harbor towns and idyllic beaches surrounded by aquamarine waters. Yet only 20 people, including three children, live on the underpopulated island that mainly consists of male pensioners over 70.\n\nSo the local diocese of the Greek Orthodox Church is trying to lure in families with young children by offering a monthly stipend of 500 euros (about $565) for the first three years that they live there, the Los Angeles Times reported, which adds up to a little over $20,000 to help them get on their feet. The chosen ones will also be given a house, and a plot of land on which to either farm or start a business.\n\nPreference will be given to Greek citizens, and four families have already been selected to be sponsored to live on the island, the LA Times noted. Yet the church will continue to consider other applicants to help boost the local population and its economy. If nothing is done, the island will be deserted, the mayor told Greek City Times in 2018.\n\nThis is the scenic Potamos village in Antikythera island, Greece. Charalambos Andronos/iStock\n\nVermont\n\nIf a remote island without a supermarket or a gas station where you need to speak fluent Greek is a bit of a stretch, those looking to get paid to relocate can also check out Vermont.\n\nThe Green Mountain state is ready to give remote workers from out-of-state plenty of green, offering them up to $10,000 over two years if they relocate to the state on or after Jan. 1, 2019. The Remote Worker Program is offering these grants on a first-come, first-served basis to encourage young professionals to live and work in the state. (Vermont has the country's third-highest median age at 42.7 years, and its overall population has remained flat or shrunk slightly.) These new residents will get $5,000 a year to put toward qualifying expenses, which can include relocation costs, computer software and hardware, broadband access, as well as a membership to a coworking space.\n\nRelated:This U.S. state will pay you $10,000 to move there\n\nAnd Vermont is just the latest New England state coaxing young professionals with financial perks. While Maine has no trouble drawing about 36 million tourists to explore its rocky coastline each year, getting local graduates to stay for good, or drawing in young professionals from other states, has been harder. (Its median age is also high; 44, or five years older than the median age across the rest of the country.) So the 2008 Opportunity Maine Tax Credit, which helps pay off the student loans of Maine residents, has expanded to out-of-state workers. After you move to Maine, the amount of money you put toward paying your student loans each year is subtracted from your state income taxes. So if you pay $1,800 in student loans, but you owe the state $2,000 in taxes, then you just pay Maine $200 at tax time.\n\nVermont will pay remote workers $10,000 over two years — if they move there. DenisTangneyJr/iStock\n\nThe catch is, out-of-state residents must have earned their bachelors or associates degrees after 2015 to qualify; that suggests the initiative is targeted toward grads in their mid-to-late 20s, assuming they pursued their degrees right after high school. Maine residents who earned a degree after 2007 and before 2016 from a Maine school can still get the benefit, however. Visit the site to see if you meet the requirements, or to fill out the tax credit form.\n\nAnd in 2017, the mayor of Candela, Italy began offering up to 2,000 euros (about $2,350), CNN Travel reported, to lure people back to the picturesque Medieval village that has seen its population drop from more than 8,000 residents in the 1990s to just 2,700. Interested newcomers must live inside Candela, rent a house and have a job paying a salary of at least 7,500 euros ($8,800) per year to be approved for the generous offer. Singles will receive 800 ($940) euros from the town coffers, couples will get 1,200 euros ($1,400), three-member families will get 1,500 to 1,800 euros ($1,760-$2,100), and families of four to five people will get more than 2,000 euros ($2,350). Candela may also give tax credits on city waste disposal, bills and nurseries in the future.\n\nThe town has yet to respond to MarketWatch requests for comment about the application process. If Americans do want to move to Italy, however, they have to apply for a visa; visit the Department of State's website for more details.\n\nBut you don't have to cross an ocean to find a city willing to pay you a premium to live there. These U.S. and Canadian cities — and even the entire state of Alaska — are pulling out the stops to pay you to stay.\n\nNew Haven, Connecticut\n\nThe New England city's Re:New Haven initiative offers up to $80,000 in incentives for new homeowners, including $10,000 interest-free to use as a down payment on a new home, or to cover your closing costs on a house. It's also offering up to $30,000 toward home renovations and energy-saving upgrades, and $40,000 for college tuition. Plus, city employees, teachers, firefighters, police officers and military members get an extra $2,500 on top of that. And once you're settled in, the city also guarantees free in-state college tuition to students graduating from New Haven public schools. Your income can't exceed 120% of the city's median family income, but they've got a calculator to figure out where you stand.\n\nBaltimore, Maryland\n\nBuying into Baltimore gives 30 potential residents $5,000 toward buying a new house in the city through a lottery twice a year at its spring/summer and fall/winter events. The mortgage can't be greater than $517,000, however, and you've got to close on that house within 60 days of being selected in the drawing. Or its Vacants to Value program offers $10,000 to purchase a distressed, vacant property and redevelop it, which helps to combat neighborhood blight.\n\nAlaska\n\nOur northernmost state has been sharing the wealth from its oil money since 1976, when the Permanent Fund Dividend was established to divide 25% of its oil revenues each year among its permanent residents. You must live in Alaska for at least a year, be present in the state for at least 190 days in a calendar year, and not be a convicted felon in order to get your cut, which averages around $1,200 a head, but has been as high as $3,269 in 2008.\n\nKansas and Nebraska\n\nIf you're prepared to build a house from scratch on the Great Plains, a few Kansas and Nebraska towns are offering free tracts of land. Lincoln, Kansas's Free Lot Plan includes lot sizes of between 12,000 to 36,000 square feet within walking distance of the community's business district. Curtis, Nebraska also offers free lots to be built on (pending application and permit approval) in a community that already has paved roads and utilities ready. And Harmony, Nebraska offers cash rebates of $5,000 to $12,000 for those building new homes in the city.\n\nAnd if you are game to leave the States:\n\nSaskatchewan, Canada\n\nThe Graduate Retention Program doles out up to $20,000 CAD (about $15,956 USD) to graduates living in Saskatchewan to cover their tuition fees, which comes in the form of tax credit paid out over seven years — if you file your taxes in Saskatchewan. You also have to have graduated from an approved post-secondary school in Canada.\n\nChile\n\nStart-up Chile wants to turn the nation into South America's business center, so it will pay about $45,000 and give you a one-year working visa to launch your business there. It's also sharing local mentors and business contacts to help get you started, as well as $100,000 in perks, including $500 off United flights, or a $10,000 Amazon Web Services credit.\n\nAndrew Keshner contributed to this report.

The Automotive segment engages in developing, manufacturing, marketing and servicing of Ford cars, Lincoln vehicles. The Mobility segment includes Ford Smart Mobility LLC and autonomous vehicles business.

Retirement savers can contribute $18,500 in a 401(k), 403(b), most 457 plans and the Thrift Savings Plan in 2018, up $500 from last year. For people 50 and older, the additional catch-up contribution limit is unchanged at $6,000 more.\n\nOther important facts to know, according to the Internal Revenue Service:\n\nContributions, also known as deferrals, as well as employer matches and discretionary contributions or allocations of forfeitures to your accounts, should be the lesser of either 100% of your compensation level or $55,000 in 2018 (or $61,000 with catch-up contributions).\n\nWhen it comes to retirement, 60s are the new 50s\n\nEmployers may offer automatic enrollment or automatic increases to 401(k) plan contributions. The former takes money out of an employee's pay before tax and automatically places it into a 401(k) (usually around 3%), which qualify as elective deferrals. Employees can opt out of this, though it does ensure there's some money saved for retirement and has helped savers stash away maybe $29.6 billion for retirement.\n\n401(k) plan requirements cannot require employees work more than a year at the company, though some companies may have to wait until they're eligible for matching contributions and others may have vesting requirements, which means you have to work a specific number of years before those matched contributions are completely yours.\n\nIf an employee over-saves in a 401(k) plan, they have to act fast. Excess deferrals as well as any money earned from those extra dollars must be refunded by April 15 so that it is reported as regular income. If done after Tax Day, late distributions are subject to extra taxes and penalties. Companies may automatically stop contributions once the maximum is reached, but not always, so savers should check their accounts.\n\nSee:So you've maxed out your 401(k)? Here's where else to save\n\n401(k) plan contribution limits was the top query related to 401(k) plans on Google at the end of 2017, according to Google Trends. Here are some others:\n\nProposed 401(k) changes by Congress\n\nThere was talk of drastically changing 401(k) plans late last year, before the tax bill was passed. Reports suggested the contribution limit would be dropped to $2,400 per year, or somewhere between there and the then-current limit of $18,000. Others thought Congress might Rothify these accounts, by taxing contributions before investing them. Traditional 401(k) plans are tax-deferred, which means they're taxed at withdrawal. The new tax bill ended up not including either of these ideas, but still affects retirement savers and retirees, such as stopping recharacterizations of individual retirement accounts (which allow savers to undo decisions to rollover or convert accounts to Roth IRAs) or inspiring some to move to another state.\n\nRoth 401(k) vs traditional 401(k)\n\nTraditional 401(k) plans are employer-sponsored accounts that allow employees to save pre-tax dollars from their wages for retirement. A Roth 401(k) is also employer-sponsored, but contributions are invested with after-tax dollars and withdrawals are not subject to federal income tax (so long as you're 59 ½ years old and have had the account five years).\n\nThey have the same contribution limits as traditional 401(k) plans, though employees will see more taken out of their take-home pay because their wages will be taxed before a portion is invested into their retirement plan. To make the best decision, employees have to estimate what tax bracket they'll be in during retirement and assess what makes the most sense for them.\n\nAlso see:Four ways to change 401(k) plans for the better\n\n401k withdrawal age\n\nRetirement savers cannot withdraw from their 401(k) plans before they turn 59 ½ years old (unless they become disabled or are separated from their employer after turning 55 years old). If distributions are made before 59 ½ years old, savers have to pay an additional 10% tax on the distribution (loans up to 50% of vested account balances are also allowed depending on the employer and plan, though they must be repaid within five years).\n\nThe money can't stay in the account forever, though. Beginning April 1 of the calendar year in which the account holder reaches 70 ½ or retires (whichever comes later), retirement savers must start taking required minimum distributions.
If you're an entrepreneur, having a great business credit score can really help you. You'll have easier access to a business loan or line of credit. A high business credit score also helps you receive lower rates on loans and insurance. This leads to more savings for your company.\n\nSo, how do you go about establishing good credit for your business?\n\nEven if you don't know it, you likely already have several business credit scores. Credit bureaus like Experian EXPGY, +2.61% , Equifax EFX, -0.62% , and Dun & Bradstreet DNB, +1.86% gather information on businesses and calculate credit scores. As soon as you have established your credit with these agencies, you can work on improving them.\n\nThe credit agencies\n\nAs we already mentioned, the three major agencies who calculate your business credit score are Experian, Equifax, and Dun & Bradstreet. Although Experian and Equifax provide personal credit scores and reports, your business credit score is completely separate. Below, we've summarized how these bureaus score you.\n\nDun & Bradstreet\n\nThey give their users what they refer to as a PAYDEX score. It ranges from 1 – 100. This score is based on whether you make payments on time to your creditors. To get a Dun & Bradstreet score, you need a D-U-N-S number and an active trade line with at least three vendors.\n\nEquifax\n\nEquifax has several different types of business credit scores but they can be broken down into two categories. The Delinquency Scores predict the rate of delinquency on accounts. The higher the Delinquency Score, the lower the risk.\n\nYou might like: 7 year-end tax planning strategies for small business owners\n\nThe second category includes the Equifax Business Failure Scores. This indicates how likely it is a business will fail in a 12-month period. To get a credit report for your company, Equifax asks you incorporate an LLC, get a federal employer identification number, open business accounts in your legal business name and have a phone line registered to your business.\n\nExperian\n\nExperian gives scores ranging from 1 – 100. This is called the Intelliscore Plus from Experian. This score shows the risk of a business to vendors and lenders. A higher score is better. To get an Experian business score, you need a trade line or a demographic element like years on file or business size.\n\nRegistering for numbers and titles\n\nAssuming the agencies do not have ample information on your business to give you a whole credit report or a score, you don't have to worry. By registering your business for a couple of designations you may be able to get one:\n\nD-U-N-S Number\n\nEmployer Identification Number\n\nLimited Liability Company\n\nOpen business accounts\n\nOpening a business account with your business's legal name will get your business on the credit agencies' radar. Here are some accounts you can open:\n\nBusiness bank account\n\nBusiness phone line (listed)\n\nBusiness credit card or loan\n\nHaving a business credit card can help build your business's credit score. Some things to remember are to practice good credit habits like ensuring your debt-credit ratio remains low and make payments on time.\n\nBusiness loans and credit score\n\nGetting a small business loan can help you improve or build your business's credit. But if you do not have any business credit or you have bad credit, getting a business loan can be very difficult. If this happens to you, other options are taking out a loan in your personal name or getting a lender that doesn't need your credit score.\n\nOther things to do\n\nHere are a few more things to do to improve your credit score:\n\nImprove your personal credit (lenders could decide to go through your personal as well as business credit).\n\nRepair your credit if it's damaged.\n\nStay away from all behaviors that point at risk, like paying accounts late.\n\nKeep revolving debt low.\n\nHaving a great business credit score can have huge benefits. You'll likely have fewer borrowing restrictions, access lower interest rates, reduce your personal liability, keeping your personal credit safe. Remember that it's important to do your research on what types of loans or lines of credit you can qualify for. It's also important to monitor your business credit score to see where you stand so that you don't encounter problems in the future.
Some key tax deadlines and dates have changed, and the changes take effect soon. Here is what you need to know.\n\nApril 18 deadline for filing 2016 Form 1040 individual returns\n\nAs you know, the usual deadline for filing your annual personal federal income tax return is April 15 of the following year. However, that date is always adjusted for weekends and holidays. So the deadline for your 2016 Form 1040 is April 18, 2017. That date reflects the fact that April 15 and 16 fall on a weekend and April 17 is the Emancipation Day holiday in the District of Columbia. If you can't file by April 18, you can obtain an automatic six-month extension to Oct. 16 by filing Form 4868 by no later than April 18.\n\nHowever, you should pay any additional tax that you owe for 2016 with Form 4868 to avoid an interest charge penalty.\n\nDelayed refunds for personal returns claiming certain credits\n\nDue to recent legislation, the IRS cannot issue refunds before Feb. 15, 2017 for personal returns that claim the earned income tax credit or the additional child tax credit. The earned income credit can potentially be claimed by workers with modest incomes. The additional child credit is a refundable credit of up to $1,000 per qualifying child that can potentially be claimed if the regular child credit exceeds your federal income tax liability.\n\nThe refund delay for a return that claims either of the aforementioned credits affects the entire refund shown on the return — not just the portion of the refund caused by claiming one or both of the credits. Although the IRS will begin releasing refunds for returns claiming the credits on February 15, it is unlikely that the refund will arrive in your bank account or be available on your debit card before the week of Feb. 27, due the time it takes for bank account deposits and debit card credits to roll through the financial system. Note that the Feb. 27 date assumes that your return has no processing issues and you that you choose the direct deposit option or debit card option to receive your refund.\n\nFitbit seeks software success like Apple\n\nSmall business tax filing alerts\n\nChanges to several tax filing deadlines will affect many small businesses early this year. Here's the scoop.\n\nEarlier deadlines for Form 1065 partnership and LLC returns\n\nFor many years, Form 1065 partnership returns have been due three and a half months after the end of the partnership tax year. Ditto for returns of LLCs that are treated as partnerships for tax purposes. So for a calendar-year partnership or LLC, the filing deadline was April 15 of the following year (adjusted for weekends and holidays). However, recent legislation changed the deal. For partnership and LLC tax years beginning in 2016 and beyond, the Form 1065 due date is moved up by one month, to two and a half months after the close of the tax year. So the deadline for 2016 returns of calendar-year partnerships and LLCs is March 15, 2017. Six-month extensions to September 15, 2017 can be obtained by filing Form 7004 (Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File Certain Business Income Tax, Information, and Other Returns) by the un-extended due date (March 15 for a calendar-year partnership or LLC).\n\nLater deadlines for Form 1120 corporate returns\n\nFor many years, Form 1120 C corporation returns have been due two and a half months after the end of the corporation's tax year. So for a calendar-year corporation, the deadline was March 15 of the following year (adjusted for weekends and holidays). However, recent legislation established new deadlines for corporate returns. For tax years beginning in 2016 and beyond, the Form 1120 due date is generally moved back by a month, to three and a half months after the close of the corporation's tax year, which translates to April 15 (adjusted for weekends and holidays) for a calendar-year corporation. So the filing deadline for 2016 returns of calendar-year corporations is April 18, 2017. Five-month extensions to September 15, 2017 can be obtained by filing Form 7004 by the un-extended due date (April 18 for a calendar-year corporation).\n\nNo change for Form 1120S S corporation returns\n\nThe due date for Form 1120S returns of S corporations is unchanged. It is still two and a half months after the close of the tax year. So the deadline for 2016 returns of calendar-year S corporations is March 15, 2017. Six-month extensions to Sept. 15, 2017 can be obtained by filing Form 7004 by the un-extended due date (March 15 for a calendar-year S corporation).\n\nJan. 31 deadline for reporting compensation paid to workers last year\n\nIf your business pays nonemployee compensation aggregating to $600 or more to a single payee (payment recipient) in a calendar year, the business must file a Form 1099-MISC to report the payments. Similarly, employers must report wages paid to employees on Form W-2. Previously, these forms were required to be filed with the IRS and Social Security Administration (SSA) by the last day of February or by March 31 if filed electronically. Copies were required to be supplied to payees and employees by January 31 of the following year. Recent legislation moved up the deadline for filing with the IRS and SSA to Jan. 31 of the following year. So the IRS/SSA filing deadline for Forms 1099-MISC and W-2 that show payments made last year is Jan. 31, 2017. This rapidly approaching due date applies whether you submit the forms on paper or electronically.
In an effort to combat fraudulent unemployment insurance claims, which have been rampant in some states during the pandemic, gig workers and self-employed workers will be required to provide documentation of their earnings to get unemployment benefits under the new stimulus package.\n\nGig workers and self-employed people aren't traditionally eligible for unemployment benefits, but under the CARES Act, they could receive benefits through the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program. To do so, they were only required to provide an estimate of their earnings.\n\nThat made it easier for states to process jobless applications, but under the new legislation it will by and large be a pain for state workforce agencies to process applications for PUA benefits, said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy organization focused on workers' rights.\n\nAll states have been accepting documents [of past earnings], they just haven't been requiring them, she said. The Department of Labor hasn't formally specified what kind of documentation workers will be required to provide. A DOL spokesman told MarketWatch that the agency expects to have more specific guidance on documentation later this week\n\nIn guidance published on Dec. 30, three days after President Donald Trump signed the $908 billion stimulus package into law, the DOL stated only that individuals will be required to provide documentation substantiating employment or self-employment. It's most likely that states will ask claimants to provide a 1099 tax form, said Elizabeth Pancotti, a policy adviser at the pro-worker advocacy group Employ America.\n\nIt's also likely that state workforce agencies will have to devote a lot of time contacting people to gather that documentation, especially if they returned to work and were laid off again, Evermore said.\n\nImportantly, first-time applicants for PUA benefits will have only 21 days from the time they submit their application to submit documentation of their earnings, unless they are told otherwise by their state's labor department. People who were already receiving PUA before Dec. 27 will have 90 days to submit income documentation.\n\nThe legislation also provides some leeway for workers who may not have any formal documentation of their earnings if they can provide good cause for that lack of paperwork, Evermore told MarketWatch.\n\nIn addition to the 11-week extension of the PUA program, which otherwise would have expired if the new stimulus package hadn't passed, jobless Americans will also receive an additional $300 per week in federal unemployment benefits on top of their state-level benefits.\n\nRelated: When will Americans receive the extra $300 in unemployment benefits?\n\nJobless individuals in Arizona, California, New York, Louisiana, Rhode Island and Tennessee could begin to receive that additional aid this week, according to their state labor departments.\n\nIt could take another three to four weeks at a minimum for other states to begin making payments, Pancotti told MarketWatch.
Shares of tax preparation companies edged higher in midday trade Tuesday, despite the Internal Revenue Service's announcement that it would pay refunds as scheduled during the partial government shutdown. H&R Block Inc.'s stock HRB, -0.91% tacked on 0.1% and TurboTax parent Intuit Inc. shares INTU, -0.36% gained 0.7%. The IRS confirmed late Monday that it will start processing tax returns on Jan. 28 and provide refunds as scheduled. BMO Capital analyst Jeffrey Silber said that is a relatively late start to tax season compared with prior years, it is one day earlier than last year's start. Silber said this was good news for H&R's Block shares, as fears of delays due to the partial government shutdown and changes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) appear to be unwarranted. He said the tax season's start date could pull some expected fiscal fourth-quarter revenue that ends April quarter into the third-quarter ending January. H&R Block's stock has rallied 5.8% since the government shut down, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% has advanced 5.9%.
I know you were supposed to make all your New Year's resolutions for 2017 before now, but since it's still very early in the year it's OK to add some resolutions that have to do with taxes.\n\nAll these will work even if the tax changes proposed by President-elect Trump are enacted.\n\nResolve to get on the Roth IRA bandwagon\n\nYou've been hearing for years about the wonderfulness of Roth IRAs. But have you done anything about it? If not, please get on the bandwagon this year, because Roth IRAs have two huge advantages over other tax-favored retirement accounts.\n\n• You can take federal-income-tax-free Roth withdrawals after reaching age 59½ as long as you've had at least one Roth account open for more than five years. If you die, your heirs can dip into an inherited Roth account without owing any federal income tax, as long as the account has been open for more than five years. So open a Roth account now to start the five-year clock ticking. If federal income tax rates go up in the future (a distinct possibility especially for high-income folks--despite Trump's proposed tax plan), funds in your Roth IRA will be blissfully unaffected. Think of your Roth IRA as insurance against future tax rate increases, which are still quite possible over the long haul despite the Trump effect.\n\n• Roth IRAs set up in your name are exempt from the required minimum distribution (RMD) rules, which force you to start taking taxable withdrawals from other types of tax-favored retirement accounts, including traditional IRAs, after reaching age 70½. With a traditional IRA, if you fail to withdraw the proper RMD amount for a year, you owe a 50% penalty on the difference between the amount you should have taken out and what you actually took out (if anything). Ouch. In contrast, you can leave Roth IRA balances untouched for as long as you wish and continue earning federal-income-tax-free income and gains. When you die, your remaining Roth IRA balances can be left to your heirs who can then take out the money federal-income-tax-free.\n\nHere's what Trump means for the tech industry\n\nThere are two ways to get money into a Roth account\n\n• Start making annual contributions of up to $5,500 -- or $6,500 if you are age 50 or older. If you are married, your spouse can join the fun. The catches: you must have earned income at least equal to what you contribute, and the contribution privilege is phased out at higher income levels.\n\n• Convert a traditional IRA into a Roth account. A conversion is treated as a taxable distribution from the traditional account with the money going into the new Roth account. So it will trigger a bigger federal income tax bill (and maybe a bigger state income tax bill too). However, the two positive factors mentioned earlier may greatly outweigh the one-time tax hit. And if the Trump tax plan becomes reality, the tax hit may be lower than in previous years. You don't need any earned income to do a Roth conversion, and there's no income restriction either. So even retired billionaires can do Roth conversions.\n\nResolve to do year-end tax planning this year\n\nLots of people talk about year-end tax planning, but few actually follow through. Put this date in your planner right now: Saturday, Nov. 25. Thanksgiving will be over (it's on the 23rd this year), and you don't want to be out and about on that weekend anyway, because you'll get crushed by all the shoppers. Also, by Nov. 25, you should have a solid fix on your 2017 tax situation. So you can then consider selling some loser stocks and mutual fund shares held in taxable accounts to offset earlier gains, giving some appreciated securities to your favorite charity, and so forth. You should also check back here for additional year-end tax-saving tips.\n\nResolve to take advantage of tax-saving deals at work\n\nSalary-reduction contributions to tax-favored employee benefit programs reduce your taxable salary and your federal and state income tax bills. For 2017, the maximum salary-reduction contribution to a company 401(k) plan is $18,000 -- or $24,000 if you will be age 50 or older as of year-end.\n\nYou may also be able to make salary-reduction contributions to your company's cafeteria benefit plan, which may include flexible spending accounts (FSAs) to cover: (1) up to $2,600 of out-of-pocket family medical costs and (2) up to $5,000 of expenses to care for your under-age-13 children so you can work (or if you are married, so both you and your spouse can work). The tax savings from participating in FSA plans are permanent so failing to sign up is like leaving cash on the table. Don't do that!\n\nKey point: Depending on when your company ended open enrollment, it may be too late to sign up for tax-saving deals for 2017 unless you have a qualifying event (like getting divorced and becoming ineligible for coverage under your ex-spouse's employee benefit plans). But check with your company's human resources department to make sure. And if it's too late to sign up for this year, make sure to do it for next year during the open enrollment period for 2018, which may begin as early as October 2017.\n\nResolve to get your estate plan in order\n\nWhat estate plan, you ask? Exactly. People don't like to think about this subject, but you need to think about it in fairness to your heirs.\n\n• At a minimum, you should have a will if you have minor children--even if you are incredibly healthy and don't have enough assets to be even remotely worried about estate taxes. Without a will, state law decides who will raise your kids in the event of your unanticipated demise and who gets all your stuff.\n\n• Quite possibly, you do have enough assets to be exposed to estate taxes, but you don't know it. Consider this: for tax purposes, your estate includes your house, furnishings, cars, retirement plan assets, investments, equity in employer stock options, baseball card collection, and everything else you own. Here's the kicker: it also includes any proceeds from insurance on your own life unless you take steps to prevent this (such as setting up an irrevocable life insurance trust). In my experience, it is usually life insurance that causes unexpected estate tax exposure. Right now, the value of your estate must exceed $5.49 million (or $10.98 million if you are married) for you to be exposed to the federal estate tax, and that's before any estate tax relief that might be enacted by the Republicans.\n\nHowever, 20 states and the District of Columbia impose their own death or inheritance taxes. Some kick in at much lower wealth levels, and they can be expensive. For example, the New Jersey death tax currently hits estates worth over $2 million, and Washington state's estate tax is a whopping 20% on the excess of an estate's value over the 2017 exemption of $2.079 million. Bottom line: you may need to make some estate-tax-reduction moves after all, just because of where you live.\n\nResolve to consult your tax pro before major transactions\n\nObviously, you cannot plan your whole life around taxes. That said, most major life events have significant tax consequences, and over the long run taxes may be by far your highest expense category. So tax planning is important. Also, there is often a right way and a wrong way to do things tax-wise, whether it's selling your home, transferring funds from one retirement account into another, getting married, getting divorced or adopting a child, among others. To make sure you do things the right way, consult your tax pro before a deal is done. Take it from me: our beloved Internal Revenue Code is riddled with traps for the unwary, and the tax savings from obtaining competent professional advice will dwarf the fees over the long haul.
Shares in General Motors Co. GM, -1.30% fell 0.7% in premarket action on Tuesday after President-elect Donald Trump criticized the car maker in a tweet. General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers tax free across border, Trump said on Twitter. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!
Some numbers matter more than others. How much you make is important, for example, but your financial health depends far more on how much you keep.\n\nKnowing certain numbers can help you understand how well you're converting income into wealth, as well as the impact of your spending and tax situation on that process. The following calculations can help you make better decisions.\n\nYour wealth ratio\n\nA wealth ratio is a measure of how effectively you've converted your lifetime income into wealth.\n\nCalculating the ratio is a key exercise in Your Money or Your Life, a guidebook for the simple living and early retirement movements, first published in 1992. Authors Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin suggested adding up the annual earnings over your entire life, as reported in Social Security statements or old tax returns. To that total, you can add in other money received that wasn't reported to Social Security, such as investment and interest income, inheritances, gifts and gambling winnings.\n\nThe next step is to calculate your net worth — what you own (the value of your assets) minus what you owe (your debts).\n\nYour net worth divided by your lifetime income, expressed as a percentage, is your wealth ratio — or what you have to show for all the money flowing into your life. If you've earned $500,000 and your net worth is $125,000, your wealth ratio is 25%. If you've earned $1 million and your net worth is $2 million, your wealth ratio is 200%.\n\nThere's no pass/fail here. Younger people likely will have lower ratios than older people who've been saving and investing for decades. Knowing your number can motivate you to look for ways to save and invest more so that your ratio grows.\n\nYour overhead ratio\n\nHow much of your after-tax income is eaten up by basic, must-have expenses? If you're having trouble making ends meet, calculating your overhead ratio can help explain why. It also can be handy to know when you're determining if you can afford new loan payments or how much to save in an emergency fund.\n\nA must-have expense is one that can't be delayed or skipped without serious consequences. They include shelter costs, transportation, groceries, utilities, insurance, minimum loan payments and child care. In their book All Your Worth, bankruptcy expert (and current Massachusetts senator) Elizabeth Warren and her daughter Amelia Warren Tyagi recommend limiting must-haves to 50% of after-tax income.\n\nA 50% limit isn't easy to achieve, but it frees up money for wants (30%) and savings or debt repayment (20%). Sticking to a 50/30/20 budget also helps people better survive job loss and other economic setbacks by limiting their overhead. Having an emergency fund equal to three months' worth of must-have expenses is a good goal after you get on track with retirement savings and have paid off troublesome debt such as credit cards. Any loans may be affordable if the payments doesn't push your must-have expenses over the 50% mark.\n\nYour tax rates\n\nYour tax bracket doesn't reveal the amount of taxes paid on your total income. Instead, the bracket (also called the marginal tax rate) reflects how much Uncle Sam claimed of the last dollar you earned. If you're a single filer in the 25% federal tax bracket, the first $9,275 of your 2016 taxable income is taxed at the 10% rate, the next $28,375 at 15% and the amount above $37,650 at 25%.\n\nYour bracket determines the value of your itemized deductions and tax-advantaged investments. Someone in a low tax bracket, for example, doesn't get much value from write-offs, such as mortgage interest deductions or investments such as municipal bonds or variable annuities, that can benefit people in higher brackets.\n\nYour future tax bracket matters, as well. If you anticipate your bracket will drop in retirement — which happens for most people, according to experts — making deductible contributions to individual retirement accounts now is a good plan, because the tax breaks from those contributions likely will outweigh any taxes you'll pay on future withdrawals of the IRAs. If you expect your marginal tax rate to be higher in retirement, making nondeductible contributions to a Roth IRA, which offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement, could be the better plan.\n\nYour tax bracket, like your overhead and wealth ratios, can change over time. Check these numbers regularly to stay on track with your financial life.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:
To the list of things we wish we could shield children from, add identity theft.\n\nCyberthieves target children because their identities offer a clean slate with which to apply for bank accounts, credit cards or loans, government benefits and tax breaks. Criminals will often combine a child's Social Security number with a fake date of birth and address to avoid suspicion, experts say.\n\nMaking matters worse, while adults can learn quickly that their identities have been stolen, say, after being rejected for a credit card or loan, it can take years to find out that a child has been a victim of identity theft. Families often find out a child's identity was stolen when applying for college loans or scholarships, or after tax returns are filed in the child's name, says Eva Velasquez, president of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a San Diego-based nonprofit that helps victims.\n\nWhen those children become financially independent, an early and undetected identity theft can create huge barriers for them, Velasquez says. They don't have the [good and legitimate] history behind them to fall back on.\n\nIs your child a target for identity theft?\n\nHer identity was stolen when she was 11\n\nWhen Axton Betz-Hamilton rented an apartment at 19, a utility company required her to pay a $100 deposit because her credit score was low. She was shocked to discover she had a history of canceled credit cards and actions against her by collection agencies, even though she had opened only one credit card and taken out federal student loans in her name, she says.\n\nTheft of her identity when she was 11 saddled her with a credit score in the second percentile of the whole nation, says Betz-Hamilton, now 34 and an assistant professor of consumer studies at Eastern Illinois University, where her research includes identity theft.\n\nBetz-Hamilton. Courtesy Axton Betz-Hamilton\n\nThe three major credit-reporting companies, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, say they don't track figures on child-identity theft. Identity Theft Resource Center, however, says it received 298 calls related to child identity theft in 2015, or about 5.4% of the cases it heard. That was down from 6.4% in 2014, but up from 4.8% in 2013.\n\nRead: More Americans have their identities stolen in these states\n\nBecause child-identity theft tends to be detected long after the fact, such numbers may vastly underestimate the scope of the problem. Credit-reporting companies add that thefts of minors' identities are hard to uncover because children can have legitimate credit records if parents add them to a credit card as an authorized user. Meanwhile, data breaches exposing children's personal information online are becoming more common.\n\nOne-in-five U.S. households has been notified by a school of a data breach that exposed the students' information, according to a survey released in October by the National Cyber Security Alliance. Breaches affecting children also can occur in the commercial realm. VTech Holdings Ltd., a Hong Kong-based digital-learning toy-maker, said in December that names, genders and birth dates of 6.5 million of its child users were exposed in a data breach. About 2.9 million were U.S. children.\n\nRead: Do individuals need cybersecurity insurance?\n\nThe credit-reporting companies say the onus is on parents to detect thefts of their children's identities. Parents can protect their children a number of ways, starting with teaching them not to share too much information online, says Ms. Velasquez. If your kids are allowed to have access to the Internet, it leaves them vulnerable the same way it would if you let them play in the park by themselves, she says.\n\nHere are some other ways to protect children from identity theft.\n\n• Look for warning signals. Be vigilant for signs that a child's identity already may have been stolen. Well before college-loan applications or tax returns are filed, a teen may be denied a driver's license because one already exists. Other warnings may come in the form of mail sent to the children, Velasquez says, such as solicitations for loyalty programs.\n\n• React when there is a breach. If a data breach affecting a child occurs, parents should initiate free credit monitoring for the child. This will allow the parents to receive alerts if accounts are opened in the child's name, says Rod Griffin, director of public education at Experian.\n\n• Contact credit-reporting agencies. Parents should check with the agencies at least once a year to see if credit reports exist in their children's names, Griffin says. In most cases, children only have credit reports when they've been added to a parent's credit card as an authorized user. So if parents find that there is already a report in their child's name, they should request a copy. TransUnion also has an online form where parents can submit child-identity-theft inquiries.\n\n• Get a credit freeze. Only 23 states have laws allowing parents and legal guardians to put a security freeze on a minor's credit report, the National Conference of State Legislatures says. This blocks opening a line of credit using the child's identity. In states without such laws, Equifax will let parents and guardians initiate a report and then freeze it. But TransUnion and Experian will freeze only if there is already an existing report for the child.\n\nIf a report is frozen, the agencies cannot release information to lenders or others who request to screen credit unless the individual lifts the lock. Assad Lazarus, senior vice president of product and consumer experience at Equifax, says a credit freeze is the most proactive solution because it blocks the possibility that a swindler could misuse the child's credit.\n\nA hope for movement in Congress\n\nA bill has been introduced in Congress to allow parents in any state to freeze their children's credit files.\n\nWithout a frozen report, the child's Social Security number will still be clean and therefore very attractive to thieves, says U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat, and sponsor of the bill.\n\nLangevin in July 2010. Getty Images\n\nBetz-Hamilton knows how hard it can be to repair a bad credit history — even a false one. She says it took her eight years to repair damage done to her credit. During that time, she says, her first credit card was canceled, and when she got a new one it had a $300 limit and 29.9% interest rate. She also was forced to pay 18.23% for a car loan, she says.\n\nI still on occasion get collection-agency letters in the mail, she says.\n\nThis article was first published on Feb. 1, 2016.
Americans can expect to get tax refunds during the partial government shutdown after all, following a decision by the White House Office of Management and Budget.\n\nAs part of the Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service has been shut for more than two weeks, and had said refunds could not be paid. President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats are sparring over Trump's proposed border wall, and about a quarter of government has been shuttered since Dec. 22.
Constellation Brands' release included a link to its investor relations page on its website with a full table. This story has been updated.\n\nShares of Constellation Brands Inc. STZ, -0.83% rose a little more than 1% after the beer, wine and spirits company reported improved third quarter revenue and profit. Net income for the quarter was $406 million, or $1.98 per share, which is up 50% compared with the year earlier period. Adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.96, above the $1.72 FactSet consensus. Sales for the quarter hit $1.8 billion, up 10% compared with a year ago and in line with FactSet's $1.8 billion consensus. The company said beer sales increased 16%, while sales of wine and spirits rose 5%. Constellation Brands increased its fiscal 2017 outlook on earnings per share, projecting a lower tax rate. The company expects earnings in the range of $6.55 per share to $6.65. The FactSet consensus on 2017 per-share earnings is $6.45 Shares of Constellation Brands are up 10% in the trailing 12 months, while the S&P 500 Index SPX, -1.48% is up more than 12%.
Goldman Sachs Group was the darling of the Dow on Wednesday, after its stock surged nearly 10%, marking its best day in about a decade.\n\nThe investment banking giant's jump came on the back of fourth-quarter results that topped average analysts' estimates, with revenues of $8.08 billion and earnings per share, or EPS, of $6.04. Indeed, EPS was well above the diluted loss of $5.51 reported in the year-ago period.\n\nBut a footnote in investment bank's quarterly report indicates that more than one-fifth of the firm's EPS performance in the last three months of the year can be attributed to a $467 million tax benefit bank received after overpaying repatriation taxes, which were due as a result of the 2017 corporate tax reform. Goldman had expected a one-time charge of $4.4 billion related to the Trump administration's late-2017 corporate tax cuts, but the final tax benefits were better than the bank's original estimates.\n\nExcluding this benefit, diluted earnings-per-share was $4.83 for the fourth quarter of 2018, the footnote in Goldman's Q4 earnings release reads.\n\nTo at least one analyst, this tax benefit masked results that would have been far-less stellar.\n\nThe market is completely missing something on the Goldman earnings, Steve Biggar, director of financial services research at Argus Research told MarketWatch. They had an unusual low tax rate of just 16.2%, down from 19% in the first three quarters of the year, he said.\n\nGoldman's bean counters acknowledged as much during a Wednesday call to discuss its results with analysts. Second, our tax rate for 2018 was 16%. This rate includes a $487 million discrete benefit from a true-up of our prior estimate of the impact from 2017's tax legislation. The benefit reflects the impact of updated information, including subsequent guidance issued by Treasury.\n\nMeanwhile, even when subtracting this benefit, EPS of $4.83 for the quarter would have surpassed analysts' expectations of $4.30 per share, according to FactSet data.\n\nNevertheless, Biggar pointed out that setting aside gains from taxes, Goldman's results featured declines in revenues in everything from equity and debt underwriting to trading in fixed income, currencies and commodities. Revenue from so-called FICC fell 18% from a year ago to $822 million.\n\nThose trading results align with similar weakness from the likes of JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, -1.20% and Citigroup C, -1.20% , which also cited whipsawing volatility in the latter part of 2018 as a key source of quarterly woes.\n\nThe one clear beat was in the mergers and acquisitions business, he said, which was its highest since 2007, a period marked by a frenzy of outsize corporate deal making.\n\nOctavio Marenzi, CEO of capital markets management consulting firm Opimas, said investment banking advisory business was the clear bright spot in Goldman's earnings. Other results were more or less in line with the competition except for debt underwriting, where Goldman's revenues declined by 42%—far worse than the average 13% decline seen by other investment banks, he wrote in an email.\n\nThe outsize gains in Goldman's stock Wednesday, however, also may be a reflection of an overall bounceback in a beaten-down asset that had been the worst performer among financial peers. Last year, Goldman shares fell 34.4%, versus a decline in the S&P 500 of 6.2% and a drop in the Financial Select Sector SPDR fund XLF, -1.04% of 14.7%, over the same period.\n\nA Goldman spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to requests for further comment.
Most people making forecasts for 2017 are fessing up to how murky their crystal ball was a year ago, but when I looked back at my calls for 2016, it was the first time in 20-plus years that I pretty much got everything right.\n\nThe reason is that I look for the big future headlines in the mutual fund business, not in the broader financial-services industry or the world at large. In that narrow realm, it's possible to look at trends and available information and make a savvy call. In most years, I get roughly three-quarters of my predictions right, with one forecast being a bit too early and another being the wild turkey of the group.\n\nThus, reading the proverbial tarot cards visible nowadays in the fund world, here are my predictions for the coming year — the big fund stories I expect to make headlines in 2017:\n\n1. Continuing increase in fund and ETF liquidations and mergers:\n\nAccording to investment researcher Morningstar Inc., the number of funds liquidated in 2016 was nearly double the level from a year earlier, while ETF closings were up 25%.\n\nThis even as the market kept up its long rally. Most experts are forecasting returns for 2017 that are low or flat — with gains concentrated in the first six months and balanced by setbacks thereafter. If the outlook for the market is ugly before Halloween, the fund firms that didn't give up on their unloved and under-appreciated offerings in 2016 will take that step. Expect around 750 funds and ETFs to be dead by New Year's Eve.\n\n2. A blow-up in commodities ETNs, and a massive reduction in the exchange-traded note business:\n\nThe beginning of 2016 saw some moments when commodities notes such as iPath S&P GSCI Crude Oil Total Return ETN OIL, -6.93% were completely disconnected from the action of oil prices, trading at premiums rather than fair value mostly due to back-room technical reasons. The end of 2016 saw trouble for leveraged exchange-traded notes, with Velocity Shares de-listing a few issues — and then creating and re-issuing brand new replacements — leaving investors confused and mistrustful.\n\nExchange-traded notes are a cousin to exchange-traded funds, but they are not the same and their different structure comes with inherent, problematic flaws. The weird setup is precisely why many backers now want out, and many investors never want to be in them; those feelings will only intensify this year as trouble surfaces in some commodities offerings.\n\n3. A liquid fund has a liquidity crunch:\n\nLiquid-alternative funds have been increasingly popular in the business in recent years, their potential downsides largely overlooked … until now. Despite their name, liquid-alt funds often hold securities that aren't so fluid; that's not a problem, unless there's a need to cash out of securities in a hurry.\n\nWith the Fed hiking rates, you can expect increased volatility. That, in turn, makes investors jumpy. If they get antsy and want to pull too much from a liquid-alt fund, those redemptions could force sales at just the wrong time, at which point investors learn the difference between what is liquid and what is easily sold without affecting the price.\n\nFunds will either lock investors in — trying to prevent losses — or let them suffer. Either way, the pain is real.\n\nHere's what Trump means for the tech industry\n\n4. Disappointed bond fund investors:\n\nIt's not a surprise that stocks have outgained bonds over the last five years. The bigger issue is that the 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.711% low hit in July 2016 has been cited by several experts as the potential end for a bond bull market that has run for 35 years.\n\nWhile bond funds will not crater this year as rates rise — something experts were worried about a few years ago — bond-fund returns are not likely to keep up with recent levels of success.\n\n5. A big increase in unpleasant tax surprises:\n\nThe rally in late 2016 helped push back a tax problem, but unless the market is stronger than anticipated and volatility is lower than expected, funds are going to generate large taxable distributions as they react to changing market conditions.\n\nDistributions don't feel like a problem in good years when funds post big gains and taxes feel like a cost of doing a profitable business.\n\nIn a market reversal, decline or a flat/low-single-digit year, however — and especially if increased volatility pushes managers to sell into apparent trouble — funds may generate tax bills that equal or eclipse their growth; investors won't be happy with oversized tax bills on mediocre results.\n\n6. The 10-year flat-line:\n\nWith most investors focused domestically, it has been easy to ignore the fact that foreign markets could get to the end of this year and wind up showing a lost decade, a 10-year stretch where the average fund was flat or down, on average, since before the financial crisis started.\n\nLook at a 10-year chart on emerging markets, for example, and it's clear that if the average fund can't put up gains of about 25% by the end of October, the entire asset category will be showing a decade when it was under water.\n\nAccordingly, when people preach to buy domestic this year, a big weapon they will be using come the fall is the talk of a lost decade in some international markets.\n\n7. Investors give up on diversification at just the wrong time:\n\nOver the last few years, allocating assets across different investment types hasn't really worked; investors would have benefitted mostly from keeping the bulk of their holdings in big domestic stocks.\n\nThat has led to frustrated investors moving away from the traditional diversified portfolio to a factor-investing approach, which typically means they are pursuing whatever has worked lately.\n\nThe one certainty for 2017 is uncertainty; fallout from the U.S. presidential election and the Brexit vote in Great Britain — and political nervousness around the world — hasn't really hit home yet. It might turn out good or bad, but it won't show up in markets until late in the year. Meantime, there is substantial headline and volatility risk, and diversification helps to soothe those savage beasts … provided you stick with it.
The phrase death cleaning may sound jarring to unaccustomed ears, but the concept makes sense. It's about getting rid of excess rather than leaving a mess for your heirs to sort out.\n\nDeath cleaning is the literal translation of the Swedish word dostadning, which means a decluttering process that begins as people age. It's popularized in the new book The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning by Margareta Magnusson.\n\nMagnusson focuses on jettisoning stuff, but most older people's finances could use a good death cleaning as well. Simplifying and organizing our financial lives can make things easier for us while we're alive and for our survivors when we're not.\n\nYou might like: Why your clutter is costing you a bundle\n\nThis task becomes more urgent when we're in our 50s. Our financial decision-making abilities generally peak around age 53, researchers have found, while rates of cognitive decline and dementia start to climb at age 60. As we age, we tend to become more vulnerable to fraud, scams, unethical advisers and bad judgment, says financial literacy expert Lewis Mandell, author of What to Do When I Get Stupid. Cleaning up our finances can help protect us.\n\nSome steps to take:\n\nConsolidate financial accounts\n\nFewer accounts are easier to monitor for suspicious transactions and overlapping investments, plus you may save money on account fees. Your employer may allow you to transfer old 401(k) and IRA accounts into its plan, or you can consolidate them into one IRA. For simplicity, consider swapping individual stocks and bonds for professionally managed mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (but check with a tax pro before you sell any investments held outside retirement funds). Move scattered bank accounts under one roof, but keep in mind that FDIC insurance is generally limited to $250,000 per depositor per institution.\n\nWhen it comes to retirement, 60s are the new 50s\n\nAutomate payments\n\nMemory lapses can lead to missed payments, late fees and credit score damage, which can in turn drive up the cost of borrowing and insurance. You can set up regular recurring payments in your bank's bill payment system, have other bills charged to a credit card and set up an automatic payment so the card balance is paid in full each month. Head off bounced-transaction fees with true overdraft protection, which taps a line of credit or a savings account to pay over-limit transactions.\n\nPrune credit cards\n\nCertified financial planner Carolyn McClanahan in Jacksonville, Florida, recommends her older clients keep just two credit cards: one for everyday purchases and another for automatic bill payments. Closing accounts can hurt credit scores, though, so wait until you're reasonably sure you won't need to apply for a loan before you start dramatically pruning. If you're not carrying balances or heavily using any of your cards, you can close several at a time. Otherwise, close them gradually over several months or even years to minimize the credit score impact, and consider keeping your highest-limit cards.\n\nSet up a watchdog\n\nIdentify whom you want making decisions for you if you're incapacitated. Use software or a lawyer to create two durable powers of attorney — one for finances, one for health care. You don't have to name the same person in both, but do name backups in case your original choice can't serve.\n\nDon't miss: How to talk to your family about your estate plan\n\nConsider naming someone younger, because someone your age or older could become impaired at the same time you do, says Carolyn Rosenblatt, an elder-law attorney in San Rafael, California, who runs AgingParents.com. Grant online access to your accounts, or at least talk about where your trusted person can find the information she'll need, Rosenblatt recommends.\n\nAlso create in case of emergency files that your trusted person or heirs will need. These might include:\n\nYour will or living trust\n\nMedical directives, powers of attorney, living wills\n\nBirth, death and marriage certificates\n\nMilitary records\n\nSocial Security cards\n\nCar titles, property deeds and other ownership documents\n\nInsurance policies\n\nA list of your financial accounts\n\nContact information for your attorney, tax pro, financial adviser and insurance agent\n\nPhotocopies of passports, driver's licenses and credit cards\n\nAlso read: How to provide for your pet in your estate plan\n\nA safe-deposit box is not the best repository, because your trusted person may need access outside bank hours. A fireproof safe bolted to a floor in your home, or at minimum a locked file cabinet, may be better, as long as you share the combination or key (or its location) with your trusted person. Scanning paperwork and keeping an encrypted copy in the cloud could help you or someone else re-create your financial life if the originals are lost or destroyed.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:
House Republicans dropped plans Tuesday to place the independent Office of Congressional Ethics under the oversight of lawmakers, following an outpouring of criticism including from President-elect Donald Trump. The House of Representatives was due to vote on the change later Tuesday. Earlier Tuesday, Trump questioned why Republicans were making the change their number one act and priority and said tax reform and health care were more important.
U.K. stocks slipped from record highs on Tuesday, as the pound ignored worse-than-expected British manufacturing data and rallied against the dollar.\n\nWhat are markets doing: The FTSE 100 index UKX, +0.25% fell 0.5% to close at 7,648.10, easing back from the all-time closing high scored on Friday, the last trading session of 2017. The London benchmark logged a 7.6% gain for the full year, for its second straight year of advances.\n\nThe pound GBPUSD, +0.12% rose to $1.3585, up from $1.3502 late Monday in New York, trading around its highest level since late September. Sterling's gain was largely due to broad-based dollar weakness.\n\nWhat's driving the market: The pound rally squeezed U.K. stocks and particularly weighed on the big multinationals in the FTSE. As around 75% of revenues for the index are made overseas, an appreciation in sterling hits profits when converted back into the U.K. currency. Sterling stayed higher even after data from IHS Markit/CIPS showed the U.K. manufacturing PMI dropped to 56.3 in December from November's 51-month high of 58.2. The consensus forecast called for a reading of 58, according to FactSet. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.\n\nWhat are strategists saying: Sterling strength has been the undoing of the FTSE 100 this [Tuesday], as three-month highs in GBPUSD prove detrimental to the highly international index, said Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, in a note.\n\nInterestingly, the strength we have seen in sterling comes despite a sharp downturn in the UK manufacturing PMI. The deterioration in today's U.K. manufacturing PMI, coupled with expectations of lower growth in 2018 has clearly been overshadowed by the deterioration in the U.S. dollar, coupled with expectations that the BOE could raise rates yet again should inflation recede,: he said.\n\nStock movers: Among big multinationals, Unilever PLC ULVR, -0.52% UL, +0.30% fell 2%, Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC UK:RB dropped 1.7% and British American Tobacco PLC BATS, +0.40% BTI, +0.18% gave up 1.6%.\n\nBP PLC UK:BP BP, -4.00% shares lost 1%. Earlier Tuesday, the energy giant said it expects recent changes to U.S. corporate taxes to boost its future earnings, but added that it will take a one-off $1.50 billion noncash charge due to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nShares of Compass Group PLC CPG, -2.18% gave up 1.3% after news the contract caterer's chief executive, Richard Cousins, had died in a plane crash in Australia.\n\nInternational Consolidated Airlines Group SA IAG, -0.19% added 2.7%. The British Airways parent said late Friday it is buying the assets of Austrian carrier Niki, an arm of defunct Air Berlin.\n\nMarks & Spencer Group PLC MKS, -1.64% MAKSY, -2.73% ended up 0.4% after the store chain said it has sold its retail business in Hong Kong and Macau to franchise partner Al-Futtaim Group for an undisclosed sum.
Money is the top cause of stress in the U.S., the American Psychological Association reports, and the leading driver of stress in the workplace, according to studies by the National Business Group on Health, Aon Hewitt, PwC and others. The most common cause of all that anxiety? The feeling that you're just one financial shock away from disaster.\n\nFinancial shocks are shockingly common and, according to the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the capacity to absorb a financial shock is a key pillar of financial wellness.\n\nRoughly two-thirds of U.S. households experience a cut in pay, a health crisis, a layoff or other life event that adversely affects their finances over a typical five-year period, a Pew survey found. Every year, six in 10 people get hit by one of these events or a substantial, unexpected expense such as a leaky roof that needs fixing or emergency car repairs. More than half the survey's respondents said the financial shock made it hard for them to make ends meet.\n\nWhat to do in your 50s to build wealth for your retirement\n\nWhy financial shocks are so painful\n\nThe main reason financial shocks can be so devastating is because relatively few people have enough cash tucked away. A Bankrate survey last year found that 63% of Americans don't have enough in savings to comfortably handle a $500 car repair or a $1,000 emergency room bill — including nearly half of those who earn $75,000 or more.\n\nWithout enough cash to foot the bill, people often turn to credit cards or tap retirement accounts. In a 2017 PwC survey, one in five boomers said they'd had to withdraw money from their plans before retirement and a third anticipated having to do so in the future, most commonly to help manage an unexpected expense.\n\nWhat, me worry?\n\nAs the table below shows, despite more years to save, older workers are nearly as anxious about not having a financial cushion as younger ones. When needed, they often tap retirement accounts to cover the shortfall — which doesn't help their second most common financial concern.\n\n3 steps to stress less about money\n\nThat's why the most important thing you can do to improve your financial health is devising a plan that will help you manage the shocks when they arrive.\n\nThe ability and willingness to plan and save for a financial shock is the most predictive attribute of an individual's financial health, even after income and other demographic variables are held constant, notes Laura Cummings in a report from the CSFI/JP Morgan Chase Financial Solutions Lab.\n\nOf course, you probably already know you should have an emergency fund —the equivalent of three to six months of living expenses in a safe account you can get into quickly and easily. Next Avenue recently offered 10 smart ideas to build an emergency fund.\n\nThe critical missing piece: Getting yourself to actually do it.\n\nHow do you turn good intentions into action? I suggest taking these three steps:\n\n1. Make a commitment. Open a new savings account whose sole purpose is to be your emergency fund. Name it something like, Rainy Day Fund.\n\nThis leverages a behavioral finance principle known as mental accounting: We tend to think of our money in buckets and are less likely to tap an account formally designated for a specific goal.\n\nIf [the money] is not tagged for something, we consider it open hunting season and are more willing to spend it freely, noted Kristen Berman, co-founder of Duke University's Common Cents Lab, in a report for the MetLife Foundation.\n\nOnce you've opened the account, decide how much you're going to save and how frequently — say, $50 or $100 whenever you're paid. Behavioral economists call this pre-commitment: Making a pledge to take a particular action with your money makes it more likely you'll follow through. Instead of relying on ourselves to be great people, we make it harder for our future self to mess up, Berman wrote.\n\nIn a 2016 experiment, Berman's Common Cents lab, co-founded by behavioral economist and best-selling author Dan Ariely, relied on pre-commitment to help people almost double the amount of their tax refunds they saved. Users of the savings app Digit were asked by text message how much of their refund they wanted to set aside, sometimes after the funds had been deposited in their bank accounts and sometimes before they received the money. Users who committed to the goal before getting their refund saved 22% of it, vs. just 12% for those who pledged to save after they received the money.\n\n2. Make it easy on yourself. Inertia is the enemy of savers. Behavioral economists have found that people are often entangled in the demands of everyday life, so they get sidetracked by small hassles. As a result, they prioritize current needs over saving for the future.\n\nThe solution: Take good intentions out of the equation and automate the process, so you won't have to think about saving for that proverbial rainy day after a one-time set-up. It's a technique that's been used with great success in the 401(k) world, where more companies now default employees into their plans and automatically bump up their contributions every year. Employers who use these default settings have seen participation and savings rates rise dramatically.\n\nTo put your emergency savings on automatic, you could fill out a one-page form at your bank agreeing to transfer a set amount into your account at regular intervals — say, whenever you get paid. Or you could sign up at work to split direct deposit of your paycheck between your checking account and emergency fund.\n\nPsychologically, it's easier to save money you've never had in your account to spend, and you'll naturally adjust your budget to accommodate.\n\n3. Plan for the 'What-Ifs.' Give some thought to how you would manage if a financial shock hit — say, you were laid off or you and your partner split or one of you became ill. Having considered the financial ramifications in advance, even vaguely, will prove useful and maybe even comforting if the event comes to pass, at a time when your emotions will be running high.\n\nAn advance plan may also motivate you to save more and stress less.\n\nAlso see: This is why millennials can't have nice things (or save any money)\n\nIn a 2017 survey by the American Savings Education Council and the Consumer Federation of America, 82% of respondents with a financial plan in place felt they had an ample emergency fund, compared with 52% of those who didn't.\n\nPersonally, I think a lot about what-ifs.\n\nI've been married for nearly 30 years and love my husband more than the day I met him, but I've still given some thought to where I'd live if we got a divorce, how we'd then divvy our assets and how I'd manage in terms of income. (Sorry, honey.) I've done the same mental exercise in case either of us becomes ill or dies.\n\nAnd for years, I thought about what I'd do next professionally if my job as a magazine editor was eliminated, which, given the turmoil in the media industry, seemed a fair bet. When it came time to activate my plan earlier this year, I was not just ready, but excited for my next act. That's the power of a good Plan B.
If you looked at the best jobs in America, you might be led to believe that money buys happiness -- at least where careers are concerned.\n\nEach year, the job-search company Glassdoor compiles a list of the 25 best jobs. At the top of the list this year are data scientist, tax manager, solutions architect and engagement manager -- and they all boast salaries of more than $100,000.\n\nThe emphasis on salary shouldn't be a surprise, said Scott Dobroski, a community expert at Glassdoor. Salary is tied into all of our livelihoods.\n\nIn fact, salary and compensation is the single most sought-after quality of a new job based on Glassdoor research; 68% of job seekers consider it.\n\nBut as Nobel-prize winning Princeton economist Angus Deaton and psychologist Daniel Kahneman famously found, workers' day-to-day happiness rises until they reach a $75,000 salary, at which point their happiness plateaus.\n\nAnd a look at Glassdoor's methodology shows that salary is only one of the important criteria it used. The company gives each job a score based on three factors: the number of job openings, the salary, and the career opportunity associated with each job. The highest salary on the list was $135,000, for a software development manager, and the lowest was $69,548, for a technical account manager.\n\nTable: The 10 best jobs in America\n\nJob Job openings Median base salary Career opportunity Job score 1. Data scientist 1,736 $116,840 4.1 4.7 2. Tax manager 1,574 $108,000 3.9 4.7 3. Solutions architect 2,906 $119,500 3.5 4.6 4. Engagement manager 1,356 $125,000 3.8 4.6 5. Mobile developer 2,251 $90,000 3.8 4.6 6. HR manager 3,468 $85,000 3.7 4.6 7. Physician assistant 3,364 $97,000 3.5 4.6 8. Project manager 6,607 $106,680 3.3 4.5 9. Software engineer 49,270 $95,000 3.3 4.5 10. Audit manager 1,001 $95,000 3.9 4.5 Methodology: The Glassdoor Job Score is determined by weighting three factors equally: earning potential (median annual base salary), career opportunities rating, and number of job openings. Results represent job titles that rate highly among all three categories. The Glassdoor Job Score is based on a 5-point scale (5.0=best job, 1.0=bad job).\n\nAlso see: All 25 of the best jobs in America.\n\nThe next-most important factors in ranking a job were location and commute, which 59% consider, benefits and perks (57%), work/life balance (51%), hours spent working each week and number of tasks assigned (46%), career growth opportunities (38%) and company reputation (34%).\n\nSam Culbert, a professor of management and organizations at UCLA's Anderson School of Management, who has written several books including Get Rid of the Performance Review, said according to his research, satisfaction with one's boss has a significant impact on job satisfaction.\n\nThe rise of SAT cheating scandals in Asia\n\nI don't think there's many people who believe the person making the most money won the game, he said.\n\nThe vast majority of millennial workers (71%) said doing work that was meaningful to them was among the three most important factors determining career success, with 30% saying meaningful work was the single most important factor, according to a survey of 500 U.S. adults by DeVry University's Career Advisory Board conducted in 2011. And 27% said high pay was most important.\n\nGallup this month found that 44% of employees say they would consider taking a job with a different company for a raise of 20% or less. But the number is different for those who are disengaged in their company and those who are engaged, which Gallup defines as being involved in, enthusiastic about and committed to work and the workplace.\n\nMany more disengaged employees (54%) would consider leaving for a raise of 20% or less, whereas 37% of engaged employees would consider leaving.\n\nMoney is only a motivator for a short period of time, and it becomes not enough, said Shawn Murphy, the chief executive and founder of Switch and Shift, a company that helps other organizations navigate workplace culture changes, and the author of The Optimistic Workplace.\n\nIf we're only judging a job by how much it pays, it's seemingly cutting out another important element, he said. We're seeing more and more what people are wanting, which is some sort of fulfillment in their job.
BRUSSELS — The European Union will propose on Thursday a new set of rules and common standards aimed at amending corporate tax legislation across the bloc's 28 countries in an effort to thwart avoidance schemes and ensure wealthy multinationals pay their fair share.\n\nThe commission's push marks a new attempt by the EU to stop large-scale corporate tax avoidance in Europe, where governments are struggling to close budget gaps in the wake of the financial crisis and assure citizens that large companies are being held accountable for paying their share of taxes. The bloc also is reeling from disclosures that multinational companies struck alleged sweetheart deals in countries such as Luxembourg that allowed them to pay very little tax in the EU.
If you're like most people investing for and living in retirement, you probably want to make sure that you have your financial house in order sooner rather than later in the new year. But what's the best to do that? What tactics and strategies should you consider? Here's what experts had to say.\n\nBefore you create your budget for 2016, Tammy Wener, a certified financial planner with Rivkin & Rivkin in Lincolnshire, Ill., recommends reviewing your 2015 cash flow and asking yourself the following:\n\nAre you surprised by how much you spent in certain categories?\n\nDoes your spending reflect what is most important to you?\n\nDid you pay bank and/or interest charges that you could have avoided with better planning?\n\nWhat one or two simple changes could you make that would get 2016 off to a good start?\n\nCreate a budget for 2016\n\nWhen building your budget for 2016, create two columns for your itemized expenses: a projected expense column and an actual expense column, and then keep track of your actual versus your projected expenses. Normal projections of cash flow needs and tax forecasts, will give you the structure to plan appropriately, said David Demming, a certified financial planner with Demming Financial Services in Aurora, Ohio.\n\nNote that much research shows that retirees have no trouble with regular and predictable expenses; it's the unpredictable expenses — dental work, a new roof and the like — that will take you by surprise. So. make sure you earmark money to pay for unexpected expenses. Likewise, some retirees, because of required minimum distributions, might have to pay estimated taxes for the first time. Be sure to earmark money for that expense, too.\n\nNormal projections of cash flow needs and tax forecasts give us the structure to plan appropriately, send Demming. Example: Retirees should make safe harbor tax payments so they incur no IRS penalties before the deadline date, Jan. 15, 2016.\n\nTo start 2016 on the right foot, it is crucial that preretirees and retirees, if they haven't already, take steps for the next phase of their lives — a phase that could last 30-plus years, said R. Patricia Grenier, a certified financial planner with BRP/Grenier Financial Services in Springfield, Mass. A thorough understanding of their pension/retirement packages from their employers, Social Security options, Medicare and supplemental medical insurance costs are necessary.\n\nBoth those saving for retirement and those who are already retired need to know what their sources of income and expenses will be, said Grenier. A clear understanding of these will play a major role in the next step, which is cash-flow planning.\n\nConsider, by the way, matching your fixed sources of income against your essential expenses. And if there's a gap, consider ways to cover the shortfall. Read Retirement income for life: 4-box strategy.\n\nOnce your cash-flow plan is outlined, things fall into place. At this point, there will be a clear picture of what portion income will come from investments, savings, what the pre-retiree and retiree can expect their tax liability to be, etc., Grenier said. If necessary, adjustments can be made to lifestyle, expenses and investments to assure that in retirement expenses can be meet, vacations taken and provide peace of mind that they will not outlive their assets.\n\nAnother item to consider, especially if you're about to retire: On average, households spend less once they retire — but not all households, and not in the same ways, according to research from the nonpartisan Employee Benefit Research Institute.\n\nThe EBRI finds that while average spending in retirement falls in the first two years in retirement, nearly half (45.9%) of retired households actually spent more than they did just before retirement. That declines over time, and by the sixth year of retirement, just a third (33.4%) spend more than they did pre-retirement.\n\nWe also found that households that spent more in the first two years of retirement were not exclusively high-income households, Sudipto Banerjee, research associate at EBRI and author of the report, said in a release. Rather, they were distributed across all income levels.\n\nThe full report, Change in Household Spending After Retirement: Results from a Longitudinal Sample, is published in the November 2015 EBRI Notes and online at ebri.org.\n\nAnother EBRI report, meanwhile, might be help you estimate your health-care expenses in retirement. EBRI separated recurring and nonrecurring health-care services and found that usage and expenses of recurring health-care services remain stable throughout retirement, while usage of nonrecurring ones increase with age and tend to be more expensive.\n\nThe EBRI research also quantified how the usage and expenses for different types of health-care services increase during the end-of-life period.\n\nHealth care is one of the key components of retirement expenses, and is the only part of household expenditures that increase with age, Banerjee said in a release. While some of these costs are more predictable, others are uncertain, and for many people these expenses spike toward the end of life when resources are slim. To successfully manage your resources in retirement, a good plan may include separate preparations for each.\n\nAs the EBRI report points out, in 2011, average annual out-of-pocket health-care cost for a household between 65–74 years old was $4,383, which accounted for 11% of total household expenses. That shoots up for households ages 85 and above to $6,603 a year, or 19% of total household expenses.\n\nThe full report, Utilization Patterns and Out-of-Pocket Expenses for Different Health Care Services Among American Retirees, is published in the February 2015 EBRI Issue Brief No. 411, online at ebri.org.\n\nEstablish goals\n\nJanuary is a great time for people in or near retirement to do some financial housekeeping, said Melissa Sotudeh, a certified financial planner with Halpern Financial, in Rockville, Md.\n\nAnd defining your goals is at the top of the list. Are you maximizing savings? she asked. Have you rebalanced investments? Look back at the past year — not by investment performance, but by your net worth, assets minus debts. Take steps to decrease your debts and increase savings toward your goals.\n\nIn addition, Sotudeh recommends re-enrolling in catch-up contributions for active retirement plans at work. Some employers require employees to opt-in each year to participate in catch-up contributions, she said. If you're maximizing your retirement plan contributions, which you should be, don't miss this opportunity to save an additional $6,000 tax-deferred.\n\nRead IRS Announces 2016 Pension Plan Limitations; 401(k) Contribution Limit Remains Unchanged at $18,000 for 2016.\n\nNew law hits Social Security claiming strategies\n\nIt's been widely publicized, but it's worth repeating: In November, President Obama signed into law the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. Among its provisions are changes that shut down two popular Social Security claiming tactics: the-file-and-suspend and the restricted-application strategies.\n\nWener's advice: Understand how the recent Social Security changes may impact you and determine if you need to take action before May 2016.\n\nThis column, Social Security changes will hit couples, divorced women hard, explains the changes to the Social Security laws and provides questions from readers and answers from experts. Read also Millions of Americans just lost a key Social Security strategy and Congress kills Social Security claiming loopholes.\n\nAnd here's how Michael Kitces, author of the Nerd's Eye View blog, described what you need to know:\n\nFortunately, though, the new rules do not kick in immediately. Those who are already receiving benefits are not impacted at all. And those who are full retirement age — or will reach it in the next 6 months — will still have the opportunity to file-and-suspend before the crackdown takes effect after April 29, 2016.\n\nFurthermore, anyone who was born in 1953 or earlier (or Jan. 1 of 1954) will still be able to do a Restricted Application for spousal (or divorced ex-spouse) benefits, even if the filing doesn't occur until years from now.\n\nNonetheless, the next six months do mark an important transition period that merits a close look at Social Security claiming strategies, for the brief time window that all of the tools remain on the table, whether it's an individual filing and suspending for a potential lump sum reinstatement in the future, a couple claiming spousal benefits, or a family claiming dependent or disabled child benefits while delaying individual retirement benefits until age 70. And for those lucky enough to be born in 1953 or earlier, only a few years remain to consider a Restricted Application, before that deadline ends, too!, Kitces said.\n\nNot yet retired?\n\nTimothy Watters, a certified financial planner and principal at Watters Financial Services, in Paramus, N.J., said there are many aspects to deciding whether or not somebody is ready to retire. It's not just a financial decision but an emotional decision and a health-care decision as well.\n\nGiven that, Watters often suggests that people playact retirement.\n\nTo do this, calculate an estimated monthly withdrawal from your portfolio and then figure out how much money you'll be getting from Social Security and other retirement income sources. Then, subtract that from what your take-home pay is each month.\n\nI suggest saving this sum each month for a three-month period, said Watters. This will give them an excellent idea of what they will be living on in retirement. It will either give them confidence that it's a good move or it will discourage them.\n\nPerhaps, he said, the right decision is to delay retirement to allow them to work longer and save more. After being retired for year, if you decide you want to go back to work, it is rare to see someone ever go back to the level of earnings they had in the past, said Watters. Thus, it is a big decision to stop working.\n\nWatters also said it's important to plan for all the things that are going to come up in retirement. Many people do not factor in the cost of health care in retirement and/or long-term care expenses, he said.\n\nAlso, people often have unrealistically high expectations for rates of return in retirement. You may invest more conservatively and make a lower return once you are retired, said Watters. The more conservative you can be at this stage of your life, the better. When it comes to your planning options, it is better to find out now that you don't have enough saved and to work longer.\n\nYour 2016 checklist\n\nHere's Grenier's checklist of items that should be reviewed, updated or put in place. These items are:\n\nFinancial planner — A meeting is to make sure your financial life is in order.\n\nEstate planning — Are wills, trusts, power of attorney and health care proxies and beneficiary designation updated. Have circumstances changed that require a redo of your plan?\n\nInsurance — Does your current insurance plan continue to meet your needs? Are your beneficiary designation accurate?\n\nInvestments — Review, rebalance and update if necessary with your adviser.\n\nDo you have written instructions for your trustees, representatives or loved ones who will handle your affairs? This includes contact information for your financial planner, attorney, tax adviser, etc. Also include a list of your banking, investment and insurance accounts with account numbers, where statements are filed, who the contact person is, etc. (Include passwords for banking, investment accounts, etc. Include passwords to the computer and the programs needed. Don't forget passwords for social media.\n\nAnd here's what Steve Burkett, a certified financial planner with Palisade Investments in Bothell, Wash., has on his checklist for 2016:
As the first full trading week of 2021 winds down, investors have pulled off no mean feat, driving stocks higher amid a deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol and the relentless COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOne bright note for some is a new political dawn in the White House, with Democrats set to take control of both the House and Senate. That is albeit a thin margin, perhaps giving President-elect Joe Biden less power to spook markets with tax ambitions.\n\nHelping fuel Friday's gains is a report that Biden is considering a two-prong COVID-19 stimulus plan — $1,400 payments to Americans, adding to the $600 already agreed, followed by a $3 trillion tax and infrastructure plan.\n\nThat brings us to our call of the day, from JonesTrading's chief market strategist Mike O'Rourke, who warns we may have reached a tipping point for all that investor enthusiasm.\n\nThe expectation of $2,000 stimulus checks as part of an additional $1 trillion fiscal stimulus from the Biden administration has only fueled the incredibly exuberant animal spirits in the financial markets. Don't be surprised if this latest (and what should be the last) bout of fiscal stimulus marks the peak of this bubble, O'Rourke said in a note to clients.\n\nThese developments are responsible for sending U.S. equities to new all-time highs the past couple of days including a 6% rally in the Russell 2000 RUT, +0.73% . Fears about the printing and spending have sent bitcoin 17% higher over the past two days, he added.\n\nBitcoin BTCUSD, +2.19% on Friday moved above $41,00 and Thursday's record. Those gains come as the dollar DXY, +0.05% has also climbed, meaning cryptocurrency investors may not be protecting themselves from a dollar drop, said O'Rourke. They are simply paying twice as much for an 'asset' than they were at Thanksgiving, he said.\n\nAnd Bank of America's chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett told clients in a note on Friday to sell the vaccine news. That is as he noted violent inflationary price action over the last two months for assets like bitcoin.\n\nBubble warnings have also been heard this week from Jeremy Grantham, co-founder and chief investment strategist at Boston-based money manager Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co.\n\nBut some have been going the other way. Credit Suisse's U.S. equity strategist Jonathan Golub lifted his S&P 500 SPX, +0.29% year-end target to 4,200, from 4,050, partly on hopes for a stronger economic reopening as Democrats gain power in Washington.\n\nThe markets\n\nStocks DJIA, +0.58% SPX, +0.29% COMP, +0.40% are rising, a day after the Dow industrials DJIA, +0.58% closed above 31,000. European stocks SXXP, -0.45% are mostly up, and Asian markets had a mixed day.\n\nThe buzz\n\nData showed the U.S. lost 140,000 jobs in December, the first decline in eight months as the COVID-19 pandemic bore down on the economy. The jobless rate was unchanged at 6.7%.\n\nThe U.S. has suffered 4,000 new COVID-19 deaths in a single day for the first time. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 vaccine from U.S. drug company Pfizer PFE, -0.11% and its German partner BioNTech BNTX, -1.33% appears to protect against the new highly contagious U.K. and South African variants, says new research. And the European Medicines Agency says there is an extra dose in the BioNTech–Pfizer vaccine vials.\n\nAmid calls for his ouster, President Donald Trump condemned Wednesday's violence by a mob of his supporters, as he returned to Twitter TWTR, +1.37% for the first time since a 12-hour ban. The violence has left five people dead, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer, and that department's chief has now resigned. Meanwhile, education secretary Betsy DeVos became the second member of the Trump administration to quit in the wake of the riots.\n\nShares of Hyundai Motor 005380, +1.08% surged 20% in Seoul after the South Korean automobile maker confirmed talks with technology giant Apple AAPL, -0.65% to create a self-driving electric car. The Korean Kospi 180721, +0.78% gained nearly 4%. One analyst says Apple could reach deals with other partners, even electric-car maker Tesla TSLA, +3.68% .\n\nShares of Micron MU, +3.64% are rising after the memory-chip maker's earnings confirmed the industry has turned a corner.\n\nBoeing BA, +3.28% will pay more than $2.5 billion in penalties to settle charges that it misled U.S. aviation authorities over its 737 Max aircraft.\n\nChinese officials have locked down the capital of North China's Hebei province, a city of 11 million, in a bid to stop a fresh COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nRandom reads\n\n2020 competes with 2016 for warmest year ever.\n\nIdentical twins aren't so identical after all.\n\nNeed to Know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but sign up here to get it delivered once to your email box.

Growth has finally started to pick up globally, but there are still key risks on the horizon in 2017 that could shatter the newfound optimism in the world economy, warns Goldman Sachs's chief economist Jan Hatzius.\n\nSpeaking at conference in London on Monday, Hatzius noted that there has been an impressive acceleration of growth since the summer, taking the Wall Street bank's global growth forecast to an above-consensus 3.6% for this year.\n\nSee also: Goldman's Hatzius: 35% chance of Fed hike in March and markets aren't braced for it\n\nThe cheery estimate comes of the back of easing in financial conditions and looser fiscal policy, which should provide a much-needed boost particularly to developed economies, he said.\n\nHatzius, however, pointed to three major risks that could derail the upbeat outlook for the months ahead.\n\nRisk number one is associated with the transition to the Trump administration, a hard turn toward protectionism. That's certainly something we got our eye on that I think is a downside risk to the global economy, he said.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has already hinted at some aggressive trade tariffs, for example threatening Japanese car maker Toyota 7203, +4.12% with a big border tax if it builds a plant in Mexico for cars to the U.S. market. In the same vein, Ford F, -1.58% in a surprising turnaround last week said it's canceled plans for a $1.6 billion Mexico plant after facing criticism from Trump for more than a year.\n\nRisk number two is European politics, Hatzius said. While Europe has clearly improved, there's still some very significant problems, especially in the labor market of the southern European economies.\n\nThe unemployment rate in Spain, for example, is still almost 20%, while around 12% of people are without a job in Italy. Some political analysts fear there will be snap elections in Italy this year after Matteo Renzi resigned in December after losing a referendum on constitutional reforms. Other major political events this year in Europe include elections in France and Germany, as well as Brexit negotiations between the U.K. and the European Union.\n\nRead:Permabear Edwards: 'Waste of time' to save Italian banks\n\nAnd finally, for Hatzius's third key risk, he's looking further east.\n\nChina continues to see very rapid debt growth and increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio, so we will take a close look at signals from China. Especially as far as capital flows are concerned and this a major focus of our Asia economics team, he said and pointed to the charts below:
A new report released by Arcview Market Research on Tuesday says the legal marijuana industry is expected to generate nearly $40 billion in economic impact by 2021. That would be roughly a 150% increase in economic output from the $16 billion cannabis generated in 2017. The report provides estimates on cannabis's total economic contribution, direct and indirect jobs created and tax receipts from each of the 35 states that are expected to have medical and, or recreational marijuana by 2021, according to a news release. Across the country, Americans are worried about being able to find jobs and support their families, Arcview Market Research Editor-in-Chief Tom Adams said in a statement. The numerous employment opportunities created by the cannabis industry, especially in states that are legalizing adult use, cross the spectrum from retail and service jobs to science, technology and other traditional professions. The report estimates that legalization of adult-use, or recreational marijuana sales in California, which began on Tuesday, will create nearly 146,000 cannabis-related jobs in the state in four years. As California joined some 28 other states, and the District of Columbia, that have legalized recreational marijuana stocks of companies tied to the industry saw big share gains on Tuesday.
British politicians on Tuesday evening significantly hindered the U.K. government's ability to push the country into exiting the European Union without a deal.\n\nA majority of 303 British politicians backed an amendment to the government's finance bill, which will restrict it from making changes to tax laws if it forces the country to pursue a crash-out Brexit.\n\nYvette Cooper, a politician for the opposition Labour Party who had proposed the amendment, told parliamentarians she had done so because she believed the government should rule out no deal: If it won't then parliament must make sure that it has the powers to do so if it comes to the crunch, she added.\n\nSterling jumped following news of the defeat from $1.27370 at 08:20 GMT to $1.27699 at 08:50, before ticking down to trade at $1.27550 at around 10 a.m. U.K. time.\n\nBritish secretary of state for Brexit, Stephen Barclay, today kicks off three days of debate on Prime Minister Theresa May's exit deal ahead of next week's landmark parliamentary vote on the terms of the divorce.\n\nElsewhere, the head of the U.K. parliament's influential Treasury Committee criticized the government for providing insufficient information on the economic effects of Brexit.\n\nNicky Morgan, chair of the Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, had shed no more light on the economic impact of Brexit despite calls for more clarity.\n\nQ&A: The Brexit story so far...\n\nNegotiators in the U.K. and European Union agreed the terms of their divorce and a rough outline for their future relationship in November, almost 2½ years after the U.K. public voted to leave the bloc.\n\nBut a deal is by no means done.\n\nIt will only come into effect if parliaments in both the EU and U.K. agree to sign it into their respective statute books. And while the majority of European lawmakers support the deal, their British counterparts are divided.\n\nU.K. politicians had been scheduled to vote on the deal on December 11. British Prime Minister Theresa May postponed that vote at the last minute, however, as both pro and anti-EU politicians complained the deal still left the U.K. exposed to many European laws without giving it a say in their making.\n\nMay's decision to delay the vote prompted frustrated Brexit supporters in her ruling Conservative Party to launch a leadership coup. When that failed, the embattled PM appealed to EU leaders for further concessions that would persuade more U.K. politicians to back her Brexit deal. As yet, none have been forthcoming.\n\nSo what's next?\n\nBritish politicians are now scheduled to vote on the deal on January 15. May needs a simple majority of 326 of the UK's 650 parliamentarians for the exit terms she has secured to pass into national law.\n\nBut securing that will be no easy feat.\n\nThe Conservatives have a thin majority in the U.K. Parliament. Several senior government ministers resigned last year in opposition to her Brexit deal. The Democratic Unionist Party, a small Northern Ireland party that backs Brexit and props up May's government, has also repeatedly threatened to reject the agreed divorce terms.\n\nWhat happens if May loses the vote?\n\nIf May loses the vote on her EU deal by only a small majority — perhaps fewer than 50 votes — she will likely once again ask Brussels for last-ditch amendments to the deal, with a view to bringing those back to the U.K. Parliament and persuading enough politicians to back her in a second vote.\n\nEU leaders insist that the deal agreed is the only one on offer and won't be changed. But they might allow small tweaks in such a situation.\n\nIf May loses the January 15 vote by a large margin, members of her own party cannot attempt to oust her again. According to the Conservative party's rules, its politicians cannot instigate a leadership coup for 12 months after any unsuccessful attempt.\n\nBut the opposition Labour Party has said it plans to trigger a vote of no confidence in the U.K. government if May's deal is rejected — a move that could both topple the PM and trigger a general election.\n\nIs a 'no deal' Brexit then the most likely outcome?\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nThe majority of British parliamentarians don't want the country to crash out of the EU without some agreed exit terms in place. In a bid to avoid such a scenario, the U.K. Parliament voted in December to take more control over the final stage of Brexit if May's deal falls.\n\nPoliticians across all parties are pushing forward a series of amendments to key Brexit legislation that would leave the U.K. government unable to force the country into exiting without a deal. The first of these, backed by a majority of 303 parliamentarians on Jan. 8, will restrict the government from raising taxes in a crash-out Brexit.\n\nAre there any alternatives to May's deal?\n\nIf parliamentarians reject the agreed deal, several British politicians argue that the U.K. should push for indefinite membership of a satellite trading bloc to the EU known as the European Economic Area.\n\nThis is sometimes called the 'Norway option,' named after the EEA's largest member.\n\nThis option would keep the U.K. in Europe's single market, or single economic zone, without being a full member. That is an attractive prospect to U.S. businesses in London. It is also quite likely to win widespread support in parliament and in the EU.\n\nWhat about a second referendum?\n\nMay is adamant that the U.K. public has already had its say on membership of the EU.\n\nHowever, buoyed by continued opposition to May's deal, pro-EU politicians in the U.K. are preparing now to get another referendum on the agenda.\n\nEU officials have suggested they could allow a short extension to the UK's two-year exit period, which is scheduled to end on March 29, 2019 — allowing time for a referendum.\n\nBut it remains unclear what question would be put to voters or even whether enough politicians will support the move.\n\nWith so much still unknown, U.K. investors are bracing for a bumpy ride through the first quarter of 2019. The biggest surprise for markets remains a vote in support of May's exit deal on January 15.
Enough is perhaps the centrally important concept to early retirement.\n\nCalculating it with some degree of accuracy is critical for everyone, especially when we're talking about much longer retirements than most traditional retirement advice is based on.\n\nIf you already have your enough number in mind, then consider this a method of pressure testing your thinking to ensure you have adequate wiggle room built in. And if you're just starting your planning, this will help you think about the key factors that determine how much you'll want to save before you pull the plug.\n\n'Enough' as a concept\n\nIn these days of nonstop talk of decluttering, downsizing and minimalism, enough has taken on a meaning of not too much. Which it for sure does mean. But for those inclined to rush the journey to early retirement, it's worth reminding ourselves that it also means not too little. Especially if you're planning to quit work for good. There's a lot riding on that number, and it's essential that you not shrink it down too much, lest you find yourself short on funds at the very time, in your later years, when you're least able to hustle for more.\n\nYour 'enough' should ideally be many things:\n\n• Enough to allow you to live the lifestyle that allows you the greatest stoke and fulfillment\n\n• Enough to minimize future money stress, even in turbulent markets and recessions\n\n• Enough to cover emergencies and unexpected expenses without derailing your plan\n\n• Enough to let you dream big occasionally\n\n• Enough to let you sleep at night\n\nIf your enough doesn't check off all of those — say, it has enough to cover your lifestyle, but not enough to sustain a recession or emergency in the early years of your retirement — then it's probably not actually enough. And conversely, if your enough easily checks off everything, and then some, there's a chance you're falling into the one more year syndrome trap and working longer than you need to.\n\n'Enough' as a number\n\nYour enough number should be based on four main factors:\n\n1. Your annual spending, and spending trends over time\n\n2. Your contingency plans\n\n3. Your income sources\n\n4. Your projection method(s)\n\nDetermining your annual spending and multiplying it by 25, as the 4% safe withdrawal rate says you can, gives you a rough starting estimate. But 25x is a crude metric for a number that needs to account for a range of factors unique to you.\n\nFortunately, by determining the four main factors in detail, you can arrive at a number that incorporates the nuance your particulars dictate.\n\n1. Determine annual spending, and spending trends\n\nIf you're reading here, you probably don't need me to tell you that determining your annual spending is the single most important step in calculating any form of early retirement plan. Or that decreasing what you spend by chopping out mindless purchases will shrink that number, and in turn shrink your big savings target, allowing you to retire faster. That's all obvious.\n\nBut what might not be obvious is that you may not want to spend the same amount every year in retirement, and your spending now may bear little resemblance to what you'd actually spend in an ideal world in retirement.\n\nFor example, most bloggers I know who write about early retirement talk about how much more they'll travel after they quit. Which is great. But: travel isn't free. And even travel hacking isn't free. It often falls into that spend to save fallacy that tricks us into believing we're saving money when really we're spending more. Or they assume they can practice geographical arbitrage by renting out their place while they travel, which is great if it works. But what if the market turns south for an extended time and renters are hard to find? What if the market becomes saturated and you can't rent your place out? Will you just skip the travel then? Or will you wish you'd boosted your spending estimate a bit more to be less reliant on a set of circumstances out of your control?\n\nAll of this impacts your spending estimates.\n\nOn the stuff front, the things we buy for free time activities is vastly more voluminous than the stuff we buy for work. And when we suddenly have more free time, I don't know how realistic it is that we will never want to buy things that aid the activities we'll fill that free time with. If left to our own devices, wouldn't we actually be likely to want more stuff, because we'll have more time to spend on hobbies? Even Mr. Money Mustache has a whole bunch of bikes, guitars, tools and other non-free hobby stuff. We may have more time to hunt for deals and find things used, but we've made sure to account for this tendency in our future spending.\n\nOn the question of spending trends, it's worth thinking about whether level spending throughout your life is realistic. We plan to travel on the cheap in our 40s and 50s, but recognize that we probably won't be quite as enthused about crappy mattresses in cheap hotels in our 60s, and might even want to take a cruise or two (or fly first class once our miles are exhausted). Or we might get sick of living in a cold house in the mountains and decide we'd rather spend a little more to live at the beach. That's the thinking behind our two-phase retirement approach, with our leaner early years and our more cushy traditional retirement. Our plan is based on lower spending in the first 18 years of retirement, and then roughly doubled spending after age 60, perhaps more if our returns significantly outpace our projections. (Also helpful if we need long-term care, which currently costs multiple times what many early retirees plan to spend each year and is not covered by Medicare.)\n\nIn determining your enough spending level, ask yourself all of those questions:\n\n• Does your planned spending level allow you to live a life you love even if everything doesn't go to plan?\n\n• Is your planned spending level realistic given how different life will be?\n\n• Does keeping your spending level equal over time make sense for you?\n\nHere's all you need to do in your 30s for a great financial future\n\n2. Determine contingency plan philosophy\n\nIt's important to think through your own contingency philosophy, meaning what you are or aren't willing to give up to make your retirement stay solvent, should things not go to plan.\n\nRead more on contingencies\n\nThat could mean thinking through factors like:\n\nLocality-specific natural disaster deductibles — If you live in an area with hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes or tornadoes, you may have specialized insurance for those events that comes with much higher than normal homeowners insurance deductibles. If you found yourself having to pay a $30,000 deductible one year, could your plan withstand that hit? Or might you want to consider holding an amount equal to your specific deductible in a separate account, above and beyond what you're saving for retirement?\n\nSequence of returns risk — What happens if you retire into a recession (as it looks like we might)? Will your plan be able to sustain you if you deplete more of your assets early in your retirement? Will you plan to go back to work before your resume gap gets too long, or will you drastically trim back your spending? In our case, our spending plan can be cut up to 50% if necessary, not that that would be especially fun, but we'll plan to cut our spending by roughly the percentage of the market drop. Fortunately, we have boatloads of travel miles stockpiled and can still travel even if we are in a constrained spending situation.\n\nBig ticket items — What happens if you need to replace a vehicle? Buy new appliances? Make a major home repair? Move to a new place? How will you factor these harder to predict expenditures into your spending plan? In our case, we have a buffer in our magic number that allows for a chunk of big ticket items. If we don't end up using the allotted amounts in each given time frame, then we can do fun things like home renovation projects, but if we need to replace a car, we'll be glad to have that slush fund set aside.\n\n3. Determine income sources over time\n\nAt the recent Lola Retreat, Emma Pattee talked about how she became financially independent with rental income (in her 20s, amazing). Mrs. Frugalwoods talked about how their financial independence is based on a combo of assets and rental income, paired with some blog and book income. Ours on the other hand is based entirely on our investible assets, even though we also have a single rental property. That was a good reminder for me that FI is not necessarily based on wealth at all, but on passive income. Does your passive income cover your expenses? is the most important question, not How much do you have?\n\nWhich means that how much you need is based not just on how much you wish to spend, but on what sources that income comes from, and how much income those sources generate. If your spending target in retirement is $50,000 a year, that could come from $1,250,000 in invested assets (if you trust the 4% rule, or $1.6 million with 3%, or somewhere in between) that you sell off a little at a time. It could come from collecting enough rent to clear $50,000 after expenses. It could come from dividends alone on $2.5 million worth of stocks (assuming an average 2% yield — though I know dividend investors aim for better than that).\n\nHere's our income source breakdown, which varies over time:\n\n2018-2028 2029-2035 2036-2039 2039-2041 2041-2044 2044-infinity both under 60 both under 60 Mr. ONL turns 60 Ms. ONL turns 60 Mr. ONL turns 65 Ms. ONL turns 65 Taxable investments Rental income (rental mortgage paid off) Tax-deferred investments Tax-deferred investments Tax-deferred investments Tax-deferred investments Taxable investments Taxable investments Rental income Rental income Rental income Rental income\n\nMore people should build a two-phase plan like ours, as opposed to converting a lot of those tax-deferred funds for use in early retirement, as the Roth ladder allows, to avoid selling out future you who probably needs that money more than younger, industrious you does. But what matters most is that you know where your income is coming from at each stage.\n\n4. Determine projection method\n\nThe final factor in calculating your enough, after you know your spending levels at each phase, how much extra you might wish to set aside for contingencies, and where your income will come from, is to decide which method to use to calculate your projections. The 4%/25x method is the simplest, but we're big fans of doing more in-depth calculations that factor in various inflation and market returns scenarios. (There are lots of spreadsheet fans out there, so I know we're not alone.)\n\nIn the example we've shared here before, which uses imaginary numbers, we show the type of projection that our plan is based on. It's nowhere near as simple as a 4% rule calculation, but it takes into account multiple factors like when our rental income kicks in, when we can switch over to tax-deferred accounts (401(k)s that are soon to be converted to IRAs), different withdrawal levels in each phase (more spending in later years), and what we can expect to have at different rates of return.\n\nHow you factor in inflation is also important, and whether you want to adjust numbers for inflation or adjust your projected rates of return downward to keep things in today's dollars terms. Inflation has historically tended to be in the 2% to 3% range annually, so if you believe that markets will continue to average roughly 8% in the future, you can run your projections at 5% (8% minus 3%) to get a sense of what that will do.\n\nAgain, these aren't our real numbers, but in our actual projections, we use a 3%-after-inflation standard to ensure we're not basing our plans on overly optimistic future returns.\n\nBuilding out a spreadsheet like this with the formulas baked in is incredibly helpful for testing out different rates of return or different starting amounts. And a more detailed version could account for likely return differences between invested assets and assets held in cash (currently marginal returns), as well as spending differences over time.\n\nIt was ultimately by building ours and playing around with it that we arrived at our magic enough number for phase one, and verified that our 401(k) balances are already above where we need them to be, meaning we should be set for phase two.\n\nThis column was updated and published with the permission of Our Next Life —How we calculated our 'enough' number for early retirement.
Happy New Year, Elon Musk.\n\nThe Tesla TSLA, +3.68% and SpaceX founder passed Amazon's AMZN, +1.42% Jeff Bezos on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index to become the richest person in the world on Thursday morning, Bloomberg reported, as a 4.8% rise in Telsa shares pushed Musk's fortune to $188.5 billion at 10:15 a.m. Eastern, which was $1.5 billion more than Bezos's $187 billion.\n\nHow did Musk, 49, respond to the news that he passed one of his top rivals and became the wealthiest in the world?\n\nHow strange, he tweeted. Well, back to work…\n\nIndeed, the outspoken entrepreneur has been on quite a ride over the past year as his net worth has skyrocketed by more than $150 billion in what might be the fastest rise in wealth creation in history.\n\nA year ago, Musk was worth about $27 billion, and barely cracked Bloomberg's list of the 50 richest people. But Tesla saw its shares spike more than 700% last year, and the company joined the S&P 500 in December following five quarters of positive earnings.\n\nWhile the pandemic took millions of livelihoods and tens of thousands of lives across the globe last year, many of the world's wealthiest people managed to get richer. The 500 richest people in the world added a record $1.8 trillion to their combined net worth last year. And the Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies reported that the 651 U.S. billionaires saw their collective wealth grow by more than $1 trillion over nine months.\n\nRead:Here's the case for Elon Musk, Warren Buffett and the rest of America's billionaires sending $3,000 stimulus checks to everybody\n\nBloomberg notes that Bezos, who had been the world's richest person since 2017, would still hold a sizable lead over Musk if it weren't for his divorce from MacKenzie Scott in 2019, which gave his ex-wife 25% of his Amazon stake. What's more, Bezos also donated Amazon shares worth about $680 million in November.
The Internal Revenue Service on Wednesday announced that it is waiving a penalty for any taxpayer who paid at least 85% of their total tax liability during the year through federal income tax withholding, quarterly estimated tax payments or a combination of the two. The usual percentage threshold to avoid a penalty has been 90%, the IRS said in a statement. We realize there were many changes that affected people last year, and this penalty waiver will help taxpayers who inadvertently didn't have enough tax withheld, said IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig.
Did you ever think a FAANG stock might be considered a value stock?\n\nThey're not near that level yet, but the group of large-cap technology stocks suffered during the fourth quarter of 2018, and with another year of excellent sales growth expected for most of them, you might be looking at buying opportunities.\n\nHere's a chart showing total returns for the FAANGs — Facebook FB, +2.02% , Amazon.com AMZN, +0.33% , Apple AAPL, +1.27% , Netflix NFLX, +0.73% and Google holding company Alphabet's Class C shares GOOG, +1.26% — since the end of 2017:\n\nFactSet\n\nNetflix and Amazon came out well, despite the fourth-quarter pain.\n\nHere are returns since the end of the third quarter:\n\nFactSet\n\nYes, they are ugly, but you might return to being a believer in some of the FAANG stocks when you see the consensus sales growth expectations. First, take a look at forward price-to-earnings valuations, based on consensus estimates for the following 12 months, for the group:\n\nFacebook's forward P/E ratio didn't decline significantly from the end of September. However, the stock was already down 7% for 2018 through the third quarter, and the consensus earnings per estimate for the company for 2019 has declined 9% to $7.42 a share from $8.15 at the end of September.\n\nLofty valuations for Netflix and Amazon — paradigm shifters that always trade high to earnings — have declined significantly.\n\nRead:Can Netflix clear a high bar of investor expectations for a change?\n\nApple and Alphabet have also seen big declines in forward P/E valuations. Investors weren't surprised when Apple CEO Tim Cook explained a tremendous cut in the iPhone maker's sales forecast on Jan. 2; the stock was down 32% during the fourth quarter (with dividends reinvested).\n\nPrice targets and 'buy' ratings\n\nAnalysts expect double-digit share-price increases for all the FAANG stocks from these reduced levels over the next year:\n\nSo a clear majority of sell-side analysts polled by FactSet favor all the FAANG companies except for Apple, for which slightly less than half of analysts have buy or equivalent ratings on the shares, with all remaining analysts having neutral ratings for Apple.\n\nYou might be wondering how much the price targets have dropped since the end of the third quarter:\n\nPrice targets are down for all the FAANGs except Netflix.\n\nBacking up the enthusiasm\n\nFor the FAANG companies, investors remain fixated on sales growth. Here's what analysts expect:\n\nAnalysts expect slower economic growth in the U.S. in 2019 in great part because sales and especially earnings received a tremendous boost from the dramatic cut in federal corporate income-tax rates. Sales for S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% companies are expected by analysts to increase by 5.3% in 2019 and again in 2020, slowing from 9.3% in 2018.\n\nApple stands out, as you can see, with analysts expecting a slight decline in sales this year and marginal improvement during 2020. Then again, it is, by far, the cheapest stock among the FAANGs on a P/E basis. It will be fascinating to see if Cook decides an acquisition would be a good way for the company to deploy its mountain of cash.\n\nHere are analysts' expectations for earnings per share:\n\nAnalysts expect EPS for the S&P 500 to increase 21.8% for 2018, followed by 6.5%in 2019 and 11.1% in 2020.\n\nDon't miss:These beaten-down stocks are expected to roar back in 2019\n\nCreate an email alert for Philip van Doorn's Deep Dive columns here.
Concern about the burden of government borrowing is largely misplaced, a leading economist argued in a recent closely-watched address.\n\nOlivier Blanchard, the outgoing president of the American Economic Association and the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, used his last speech to try to upset the conventional wisdom that excessive debt was a danger for governments across the world.\n\nWhat do I want you to go away with? Not the notion that debt is good but that debt might not be so bad, Blanchard said.\n\nJason Furman, who was President Obama's chief economist, said Blanchard's comments were groundbreaking.\n\nFiscal austerity was the dominant philosophy across the leading industrial countries in the wake of the financial crisis. Doubts of the policy approach are starting to emerge\n\nAusterity has been the most damaging policy mistake in economics in recent years, said Jared Bernstein, a former chief economist to Vice President Joe Biden and now a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nIt was like a tragicomedy with governments in Washington, Brussels, and Berlin...getting fiscal policy wrong at great cost to the citizenry, Bernstein said.\n\nIn his speech over the weekend to the AEA's annual conference in Atlanta, Blanchard argued that in the new-low-inflation environment, the real interest rate will remain lower than a countries growth rate. This will allow governments to continue to roll over debt and the debt-to-GDP ratio will shrink over time.\n\nBlanchard did acknowledge it was important that the government spending be well thought out.\n\nThere has to be good reasons to do it, he said. If the spending is well planned, the benefits are likely to exceed the costs.\n\nIn the U.S.. Blanchard's speech may embolden progressive Democrats, who don't want their party to make fiscal austerity a priority.\n\nDon't miss: How the recent tax cuts and budget deal jack up the national debt - in one chart\n\nThe new Democrats are influenced by modern monetary theory, who argue that governments can keep borrowing until there's strong inflationary pressures.
Sunny Blaylock is one of the thousands of furloughed workers whose life is on hold because of the partial government shutdown.\n\nThe Arlington, Va. resident is a federal contractor, and both she and her diplomat husband are missing paychecks while most of the government is closed. She intended to pay off student loans this month, but will have to delay that goal.\n\nShe'll also have to cut back on saving for retirement and her children's college funds. And although this is a time when most D.C.-area parents are arranging child care for the summer, she hasn't yet. You can't afford to live here without two parents working, so you have to book in January and we haven't, she said. I could, but I just don't want to use our savings because I don't know how long we'll need to live off of savings.\n\nThe 39-year-old mom of two, who is currently out of work while her husband works without pay, said she's aware she's more fortunate than others in this situation. Unlike many Americans , she and her husband have some cash savings to draw on.\n\nThe shutdown hit its 28 day on Friday, making it the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, and is the direct result of a debate between President Trump and Congress to fund the building over the funding of Trump's proposed border wall.\n\nSunny Blaylock and her family.\n\nDon't miss:This furloughed worker found a unique way to make $2,000 a month during the shutdown\n\nStill, the shutdown has taken an emotional and financial toll on her and her family. Health insurance deductibles have reset because of the New Year, which means any sickness or health emergency would hit them hard monetarily. They're not going out or buying things, and spending frugally on food.\n\nHer confidence has plummeted, and she thinks it will take months to recover emotionally, she said. You don't plan on your government creating the emergency, she said. You think of a problem with the roof, or someone gets hurt or sick. Not that the government decided not to pay my husband and make it so that I am unemployed.\n\nThe shutdown could also have a ripple effect on workers' finances, even after it ends. Missed payments for credit card or mortgages are eventually reported to credit bureaus, which could result in as much as a 90- to 110-point drop on a FICO score of 780 or higher, according to Credit.com.\n\nCredit scores affect the eligibility or interest rates borrowers have when looking to finance a car or home. Although that risk is at the tops of minds for many furloughed workers, their first priority should be to pay whatever they can toward their bills now — eventually credit scores will rebound, said Beverly Harzog, a credit-card expert at U.S. News & World Report and author of The Debt Escape Plan.\n\n 'You think of a problem with the roof, or someone gets hurt or sick. Not that the government decided not to pay my husband and make it so that I am unemployed.'  — —Sunny Blaylock, a furloughed government worker.\n\nBlaylock still plans to pay off her student debt, though at a later date, and said her first priority will be to save enough to weather another shutdown. We have to be extremely fiscally conservative and financially competent, which we felt we were but this has made us more acutely aware of this need, she said.\n\nSee:4 awful ways the government shutdown affects furloughed workers\n\nHere are a few other ways furloughed workers can recover when the shutdown is finally over:\n\nDon't splurge (if you're lucky to get paid post-shutdown)\n\nThe president signed a bill allowing federal employees to receive back-pay when the partial government shutdown ends. This does not include federal contractors, who will rely on their companies to pay them if they're able.\n\nBut federal workers shouldn't get too excited when they see a larger-than-average paycheck, said Mariel Beasley, co-founder and principal at Common Cents Lab, a behavioral science research center at Duke University.\n\nWorkers are always at greater risk of overspending after a pay day, according to previous research, which means federal employees getting a fat check for their current and back pay may be tempted to pay off immediate debts and treat themselves to something extra without putting money aside.\n\nIt is hard for us to remember scarcity when we are in times of abundance, Beasley said.\n\nPay off debts, by all means, but do so rationally\n\nThe shutdown has likely inspired some government workers to pay off debts as soon as they can when the shutdown is over, but they should only do so carefully, Beasley said. Borrowers tend to want to pay off small debts first, which is naturally motivating, but they should pay attention to the steepest interest rates.\n\nThere's an ongoing debate about which method — small loans first or higher-interest loans first — is best for paying off debt. Beasley suggested tackling higher interest payments first, which would ultimately prevent borrowers from spending so much on interest. If there is a small loan that a borrower really wants to pay off, he or she should attend to that if it helps keep the repayment of other loans on track.\n\nPaying off debts quickly may feel good, but workers should also build up an emergency savings account. Putting extra money toward debt repayment each month won't offset future dues and, without a cushion, they could end up in the same or worse trouble if they were to be furloughed again, or face another emergency.\n\nTraditional financial advice says Americans should have three to six months of expenses saved, but Beasley suggests they also have the equivalent of one to two months of loan payments set aside as well.\n\nAlso see: Hard-up federal workers seek jobless benefits, dip into retirement funds to pay bills as shutdown drags on\n\nReflect on how you survived this period of frugality\n\nFederal workers have had to intentionally cut down on spending this month because they're unsure of if or when they will go back to work or get paid. When the shutdown is over, some may be free to go back to their usual lifestyles, if they only lived for today, but they might also want to reflect on what they can do differently to save more, Beasley said.\n\nIf they lived without subscription services like Spotify or Netflix NFLX, +0.73% for a month, maybe it's time to reevaluate whether it's really a worthwhile expense. Some workers may want to change their direct deposit options, so that more of their money is automatically going into a savings account for emergencies. Or they might want to negotiate cable or cellphone bills, create a budget and cancel unused subscriptions. It's leveraging that motivation to be better prepared, she said.\n\nFurloughed workers are scrambling to delay their bills, and some lenders are offering assistance with zero-interest loans or reversed overdraft fees. Bills, of course, are not disappearing — unpaid federal workers owe more than $400 million in mortgage and rent payments, and are also on the hook for auto loans, credit-card debt, student loans and everyday expenses.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service will still issue tax refunds, which usually provide relief for>cut taxpayers often use to pay off debt and medical bills, but likely at a slower rate because the agency is understaffed.
The IRS has released the new-and-improved Form 1040 for your 2018 individual federal income tax return. The good news is the return is now postcard-sized if your tax situation is super-simple. The bad news is it's probably not — in which case the new Form 1040 is just alarmingly different than before rather than simpler. So if you really hate change, stop here and hire a tax pro to prepare your 2018 return. Otherwise, please keep reading, but make sure you're sitting down.\n\nKey Point: The due date for your 2018 Form 1040 is April 15, 2019, unless you live in Maine or Massachusetts, in which case your deadline is April 17, 2019. You can automatically extend your return to Oct. 15, 2019 by filing Form 4868 with the IRS on or before the applicable deadline. Find Form 4868 at www.irs.gov.\n\nThe base postcard return\n\nThe base Form 1040 for 2018, first unveiled last summer, is a two-sided postcard that looks like this.\n\nThe new postcard-sized Form 1040. IRS\n\nThe front side of the postcard is just for informational stuff like your name, address, Social Security number, dependents, and filing status. Your signature also goes on this side.\n\nThe back side is for numbers (income, deductions, taxes, and credits). It bears a family resemblance to the bottom half of page 1 and page 2 of the old Form 1040.\n\nIn the simplest situations, you only have to file the base postcard return. More likely, you'll also have to file one or more of new Schedules 1-6.\n\nEven if you only have to file the base postcard return, you may have to fill out some worksheets that are included in the Form 1040 instructions. For example, if you claim the new deduction for qualified business income from pass-through entities (sole proprietorships, LLCs, partnerships, and S corporations), there's a worksheet to calculate your allowable deduction. You don't file these worksheets with your return, but you should keep them with your tax records for the year.\n\nKey Point: Forms 1040A and 1040-EZ, which were simplified versions of the old Form 1040, have been eliminated for 2018. Everybody now files the base Form 1040 plus any additional required schedules and forms.\n\nThose may include:\n\nNew Schedule 1 (Additional Income and Adjustments to Income)\n\nIf you have additional income and/or adjustments to income, you must file the new Schedule 1 with your base postcard return. For example, you must file Schedule 1 if you had business income, capital gains; unemployment compensation; alimony received; or gambling winnings. You must also file Schedule 1 if you are claiming so-called above-the-line deductions for things like deductible IRA and self-employed retirement plan contributions; self-employed health insurance premiums; 50% of self-employment tax; HSA contributions; student loan interest; or educator expenses.\n\nNew Schedule 2 (Tax)\n\nFile this if you owe the alternative minimum tax (AMT) or have to repay excess advance Obamacare premium tax credits that were sent to your health insurance company.\n\nNew Schedule 3: (Nonrefundable Credits)\n\nFile this if you are claiming nonrefundable tax credits other than the child tax credit or the new $500 credit for other dependents. These include the credits for higher-education expenses, child and dependent care expenses, adoption expenses, retirement savers, residential energy-saving expenditures, electric vehicles, and foreign taxes.\n\nNew Schedule 4 (Other Taxes)\n\nFile this if you owe other taxes such as the 10% penalty tax on early retirement account withdrawals, the penalty tax for not having Obamacare-compliant health insurance coverage, the additional 0.9% Medicare tax on higher earners, or the 3.8% net investment income tax on higher-income individuals.\n\nNew Schedule 5 (Other Payments and Refundable Credits)\n\nFile this if you have tax payments or refundable credits (treated the same as tax payments) that cannot be entered directly on Form 1040. These include quarterly estimated tax payments, the tax payment with an extension request on Form 4868, the Obamacare health insurance premium tax credit, and the credit for overpaid Social Security tax if you had several employers last year.\n\nNew Schedule 6 (Foreign Address and Third-Party Designee)\n\nFile this if you have a foreign address or want to allow another person (other than your paid preparer) to discuss your return with the IRS.\n\nYou may still have to file some old-school schedules\n\nAs in the past, you may still have to file one or more of the following additional schedules with your base Form 1040.\n\n* Schedule A if you itemize deductions. However, many folks won't be itemizing for 2018, because the standard deduction amounts were almost doubled by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For 2018, the standard deductions are $12,000 for unmarried individuals, $24,000 for married joint-filing couples, and $18,000 for heads of households.\n\n* Schedule B if you had more than $1,500 of income from interest and/or ordinary dividends or if you had certain types of interest and dividend income (such as tax-free interest from U.S. Savings Bonds used to pay qualified higher education expenses).\n\n* Schedule C if you had a profit or loss from one or more business activities.\n\n* Schedule D if you had capital gains or losses.\n\n* Schedule E if you had royalty income or income or loss from rental real estate, a partnership, an LLC treated as a partnership for tax purposes, an S corporation, or an estate or trust.\n\n* Schedule F if you had income or loss from a farming or ranching activity.\n\n* Schedule SE if you owe the self-employment tax.\n\n* Schedule H if you owe payroll taxes for household employees.\n\n* Schedule EIC if you are claiming the earned income tax credit.\n\n* Schedule 8812 if you are claiming the refundable additional child tax credit.\n\nYou may still have to file some old-school forms, too\n\nAs in the past, you may still have to file one or more additional tax forms with your base 2018 Form 1040. For example, if you owe the AMT, you must file Form 6251. If you had capital gains, you must Form 8949 in addition to Schedule D. If you claim the credit for child care expenses, you must file Form 2441. As in the past, the list goes on and on.\n\nHas anything really changed?\n\nAs with most tax questions, the answer is yes and no. In the simplest situations, taxpayers can now file the postcard-sized base Form 1040 and be done with it. Good for them. These folks may be able to dispense with paid tax preparers. But if your tax situation has any degree of complexity, preparing your 2018 return won't be any easier than before. But it will be different. And your paid preparer may charge more than before as a result. Sorry about that.
How much: $212,000 in 6.5 years\n\nOkeoma Moronu fell from one major life decision to the next. She went to law school in New York City because people said she had a knack for law. And the more than $200,000 in student loans she needed to fund that degree? She figured that was just par for the course.\n\nBut when Moronu had to confront the reality of how much she owed — and was paying in interest — the young lawyer realized she needed to take a more purposeful approach to life and her finances.\n\nSo she dedicated herself to what she calls her happiness journey. A big part of that journey was freeing herself from the $3,000 monthly student loan payment that stretched her budget despite making $160,000 her first year out of law school.\n\nAfter paying off $212,000 in 6.5 years, Moronu and her young family now live in Costa Rica and continue to focus more on happiness and less on burdensome debt.\n\nMoronu chronicles her journey on her blog, The Happy Lawyer Project. She recently talked with NerdWallet to share her story, which may inspire your own debt-free journey.\n\nHow much debt did you have and what's your debt load now?\n\nI had $212,000 in student loans.\n\nMy husband and I currently have a $70,000 mortgage on rental properties and a $20,000 balance on a 0% annual percentage rate credit card that covered the remaining balance on our house in Costa Rica, which we mostly paid cash for and expect to pay off by February.\n\nHow did you get into debt?\n\nLaw school. I was completely in over my head.\n\nI grew up overseas, spent most of childhood in Indonesia and moved to the United States in high school. As a result, I didn't have much guidance growing up in terms of college or finance because my parents didn't know about that.\n\nI ended up in New York at Columbia Law School and took out a lot of student loans, a little over $200,000 by the end. It was a much bigger financial decision than anyone in my family had to make before. So I just blindly went all in. It also happened to be 2008, so it was a terrible time to take on loans. Many of my interest rates were around 8%.\n\nWhen did you begin to understand your situation?\n\nThe first time I understood what I got myself into was when I graduated and I had to go to the loan office at my school.\n\nI saw my total outstanding balance and what my monthly payment was going to be. I owed $212,000 and I was supposed to pay around $3,000 a month. It was a complete shock. I felt like the floor was pulled out from under me. It was the biggest number I had ever seen.\n\nAt that time, my husband and I were planning our wedding … I didn't have much time to process it. I was thinking, You're a smart girl, you'll figure it out.\n\nMy loans were deferred for six months after graduating, but at the time I had this very grand goal of paying $4,000 a month, because that's what I thought I could afford each month. When I started paying off my loans after the six-month period, I remember not being disciplined around that and letting it slip a lot — paying less than the $4,000 I wanted to pay each month.\n\nAlso see: My husband and I paid off $193,000 in debt — but now he never wants to take a vacation or socialize with friends\n\nIt was incredible because I thought I was going to pay so much toward my loans, but I hadn't accounted for the cost of living in New York City. Once I paid for my exorbitant rent and food and taxes, there was just not that much left to put toward my loans.\n\nWhen did you decide to get out of debt?\n\nI ended up going to Singapore for work for a year, and it was only when I returned that I realized I needed to get serious about paying off my debt.\n\nUpon my return, I remember talking with my law firm about my taxes, because they handled them. I remember having to tell them how much my interest payments were that year, and it was around $30,000 from all my loan servicers.\n\nThat's when I said, This is insane. And that's when I started digging into the interest rates of my loans and I refinanced for the first time.\n\nHow did you get out of debt?\n\nI put a timeline in place to pay off my debt in five years, and I just started throwing all my extra cash, like bonuses, tax refunds and gifts, toward paying off the loans. I was making $160,000 a year with my first job out of college and was paying a little more than $3,000 a month to my student loans, which was just over the minimum.\n\nUltimately, I didn't end up paying off the debt in five years, because my husband and I had kids and we bought real estate and there were so many expenses of living in New York. But each year when my salary increased, I would put the difference toward my debt. I also refinanced my various loans four times over the years to manage interest rates.\n\nWhile I was paying off my student loans, my husband was also paying off his own debt. He's had numerous jobs over the years I was paying off my debt, making between $22,000 and $80,000, and he took time off at various times to take care of our kids. Over the years I was paying off my debt, my husband often directed most of his income toward his debt or child care.\n\nYou moved to Texas to boost your debt payoff. How did that help?\n\nThe move to Texas was easily the biggest sacrifice we made in pursuit of debt payoff. We loved (and still love) Brooklyn and had a great community of friends, great jobs that we enjoyed. But we knew that we could significantly increase our disposable income by moving to Texas. The move was incredibly challenging for us as a family, but we knew it was going to be worth it.\n\nWe knew that having that extra disposable income [thanks to the lower cost of living] would mean that we would be able to not only pay off the student loans, but also able to start building a real foundation for our financial future, including the move to Costa Rica.\n\nHow did your happiness journey guide your debt payoff?\n\nPrior to becoming a happiness enthusiast, I was driven by a lot of fear. I was constantly afraid I was going to lose my job and I wouldn't be able to pay off my debt. There was a fear I had that something could happen between where I was in paying it off and getting my balance to zero.\n\nRead: Kevin O'Leary says you need to have all your debts paid off by age 45 — including your mortgage\n\nSo I switched my mentality … I figured if I could get my [debt] to a manageable number, that for me was as good as getting it to zero. By focusing on happiness, I regained some control in the process. It helps me not feel like I was trapped by that financial situation.\n\nThat way, I could take a lower-paying job that is maybe less stressful and could still make my debt obligations. That was very liberating, because I realized that debt is very scary if you don't think you can keep up with it.\n\nHow has your life changed for the better since you ditched debt?\n\nMy husband and I were able to leave our 9-to-5 jobs and take a sabbatical in Nosara, Costa Rica, while we expand our real estate portfolio and pursue other passion projects.\n\nThe truth is that we went from being a high-earning family to a family living on a very tight budget, but our lifestyle hasn't changed that much. It's really just the rate at which we are able to save and grow our wealth that has been affected, but our day-to-day life is so much more fulfilling now that we feel financially free.\n\n[After taking time off, Moronu recently accepted a job working remotely as legal counsel for a startup in the Bay Area. She continues to run her blog and podcast. The family continues to live in Costa Rica.]\n\nHow to ditch your own debt\n\nYou can ditch your own debt, too. Here's how.\n\nOverwhelmed by student loans? Know your options. Income-driven repayment plans and refinancing loans can help make your payments more manageable.\n\nFind your why. Focusing on your financial and life goals can keep you motivated to pay off your debt over the long term.\n\nPick a debt payoff strategy.

Forget vacations, new wardrobes or money toward a new car — when people get their tax refunds, health care spending rises 60% immediately in the week following, according to a new study.\n\nHealth care continues to be the top expenditure with these tax refund payments over the next 100 days, according to the report Deferred Care: How Tax Refunds Enable Healthcare Spending by JPMorgan Chase Institute. Cash-strapped families are more likely to use the money towards health care — out-of-pocket medical expenses on debit cards increased 83% following a tax refund check, instead of no real change to credit card spending, suggesting the people who needed the money were the ones making the transactions after receiving a refund. Account holders in the top quintile (who had more than $3,500 in their accounts) saw an 11% rise in health care spending after receiving the refund, while people in the lowest quintile (with less than $536 in their accounts) increased health care spending by 220%.\n\nSee: American health care is so messed up that a whole industry has been created to help navigate it\n\nIt isn't clear if they waited to pay their providers, or if they waited to go to a doctor until the money came in, but 62% of the tax refund-triggered health care spending was done in-person, potentially indicating they paid at the time of receiving care, said Diana Farrell, president and chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase Institute. We should care about that, she said. It means often they're not getting the best treatment they can.\n\nHere's all you need to do in your 30s for a great financial future\n\nOther health care spending sparked by tax refunds: dentists and outstanding hospital bills. Almost a third of people spent money after receiving their tax refund on dentists, compared to 27% of in-person payments before receiving a tax refund. Another 39% of spending went toward nursing service providers, ambulance service providers, medical laboratories, opticians, optometrists and chiropractors. People were less likely to spend on doctors or hospitals than pre-tax refund payment.\n\nAlso see: This expensive risk lurks in nearly every medical experience you have\n\nThe cost of health care rises every year, and there's no indication that will stop anytime soon. What's even more harrowing, a lot of that happens in retirement — an American couple retiring last year could expect to spend $275,000 in health care through retirement, up 6% since 2016, according to Fidelity. Not only is it expensive, but it is confusing — most Americans don't understand all the plans and insurance policies available, and tend to shut down before trying to comprehend it. To avoid going broke in retirement cause of health care, experts suggest saving for it specifically (such as through an HSA), paying as you go and adopting a healthy lifestyle — the sooner the better.
Stock traders have become ETF traders.\n\nIn a sign of how fast exchange-traded funds have become the dominant security traded on Wall Street, only one of the 15 most heavily traded issues on the stock market in 2016 was actually a stock. The rest were ETFs, which trade like stocks but, like mutual funds, have a variety of holdings.\n\nTotal ETF volume in 2016 rose 17% over 2016, according to Credit Suisse. It was up 50% from 2015.To compare, trading volume for stocks rose just 7% between 2014 and 2016.\n\nETFs are increasingly favored by investors because they offer easy access to pretty much any sector, region, asset class, or strategy, typically with lower fees and greater tax efficiency than mutual funds. While the accessibility of ETFs, the largest of which are index funds, has played into the growing trend of passive investing, the spike in volume indicates that traders are also using the funds as short-term holdings rather than core positions in their portfolios.\n\nIn 2016, ETFs accounted for 30% of all U.S. trading in terms of value, and 23% in terms of share volume. Their usage represents remarkably swift adoption of an asset class that is not even 30 years old — the first launched in 1993. Trading growth could accelerate in 2017 with the implementation of the Labor Department's fiduciary rule, which is widely expected to favor ETFs.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, -1.45% — the oldest and largest ETF, with about $230 billion in assets — was the most traded of any security last year, with an average daily volume of almost 90 million shares. The most active stock, Bank of America Corp. BAC, +2.61% , came in 13th place, with a little more than 20 million shares traded daily, on average.\n\nSimilar results were seen when activity is measured by the value traded, as opposed to just the number of shares. The S&P ETF still came in first, with $19 billion traded in the fund each day, while a stock didn't enter the ranks until 13th place. By this metric, however, Apple Inc. AAPL, -3.39% was most active, with less than $1 billion traded.\n\nThis is particularly notable as Apple is the largest U.S. company by market cap, at around $626 billion, more than twice the assets of the S&P fund.\n\nCharts displaying the most active securities of 2016 by both share volume and value traded. Charts courtesy Credit Suisse.\n\nU.S. equity funds remain the most popular ETF category by far, in terms of volume. However, other categories saw much faster growth over 2016. While volume for U.S. equity funds rose 19% in 2016, international equity funds grew 55% while fixed income ETFs had volume growth of 68%. Commodity-based funds saw the biggest volume uptick, growing 172%, according to Credit Suisse.\n\nEquity ETFs still account for the bulk of ETF trading, but the growth is coming from ETFs on other asset classes, wrote the team of Credit Suisse analysts, led by Ana Avramovic, the firm's director of market structure strategy.\n\nThe second-most popular ETF by volume was the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF GDX, -1.72% , which had almost 80 million shares traded daily. The VanEck fund was one of the best-performing sector funds in 2016; it is expected to be one of the most volatile in 2017.

The Powerball jackpot is now so big that someone might actually win all of it.\n\nThat's not about the odds or the pace of actual ticket sales and how many numerical combinations will be covered by the tickets. It's about the way the jackpot is paid out, and how this jackpot is so ginormous that it might change the way the typical lottery winner claims their prize.\n\nThe thought process is worth covering because while you aren't winning this lottery (again), work may someday give you the same choice as the winner on whether to take a lump-sum payment or go with long-term distribution of money you've earned.\n\nThe current lottery frenzy has revived stories of losers turned lucky, folks who squandered their winnings in a storm of bad decisions, mis-spending, family greed and more.\n\n It never occurs to most winners that the annuitized payout is really about putting a damper on stupidity, mistakes and greed. \n\nRead:What time is the Powerball drawing?\n\nBut those tales of woe start when the winner takes his jackpot in one big check instead of annuitizing the returns over 30 years.\n\nWhen someone claims their jackpot in a lump sum, the only way she is paid the actual amount everyone is talking about is by taking it in payments spread over three decades.\n\nIn a lottery with a more pedestrian jackpot of $400 million, the lump sum for a solo winner amounts to a bit less than $225 million, pre-taxes. The 30-year payout distribution of the full $400 million would start with a payment of $7 million, and grow over time.\n\nStill, you can understand why a winner promised hundreds of millions wants something much bigger — and less budget-conscious — as they transition to their new, rich life.\n\nAlso see:These are the taxes you'd pay on a Powerball jackpot\n\nIt never occurs to most winners that the annuitized payout is really about putting a damper on stupidity, mistakes and greed.\n\nThis week, however, the grand prize is so big that even the annuity payments are staggering.\n\nAccording to USAMega.com, if one person wins the current lottery and the jackpot is $1.5 billion, the lump-sum payout will be $930 million. After federal taxes are withheld — and Uncle Sam requires that 25% of the winnings are withheld, but the winner presumably owes closer to 40% overall — the payment is a bit under $700 million, which may face additional state withholdings. If state tariffs are at the 5% or 6% rate, the net payout will be at or below $650 million. (The confusing discrepancy between what is withheld versus what someone at the top tax rate must pay is why plenty of past lottery winners wound up in tax trouble with Uncle Sam.)\n\nNow let's figure out the annuity payout, which amounts to 30 average annual payments of $50 million, pre-tax. After the federal tax withholdings, that's an average of $37.5 million per year, according to USAMega.com. A 5% state tax would reduce it to an average of $35 million.\n\nHere's where people misunderstand how the annuity works.\n\nIn that example with the $35 million average payment, the first net payment — after the 25% federal withholding and the state taxes — would be about $16 million. The 30th installment would be north of $65 million.\n\nThe total pre-tax payout would be the $1.5 billion, with the winner (and family/heirs) collecting $1.05 billion.\n\nBuried in all that math are some targets of the decision-making that investors and savers go through.\n\nYou've won the $1.5 billion Powerball. Whom should you call?\n\nThe basic decision here for most people is simply: Which way gives me the most money in the end?\n\nThat result would depend on how much of the lump-sum is invested and the rate of return that money generates, weighed against not only the annuity payout but any savings/investing done with portions of that money.\n\nWhile the annuity puts a cap on how much dumb stuff the winner can do in any given year, any person analyzing an annuity needs to be comfortable that the firm behind it is not going to default.\n\nConsidering whether the payee will honor the annuity is where the lottery choice can actually help investors looking at lump-sum payouts offered as a retirement incentive or as a means for a company to get former employees out of a pension plan.\n\nIn these cases, the saver can either keep their pension benefits or take a lump sum. As with the lottery, the lump-sum option is very attractive, even when it's not some enormous amount.\n\nLike a lottery winner, people focus on what they can do now with the $25,000 or $50,000 they're offered for a small pension, rather than on the ability to secure a lifetime income.\n\nAsk a financial planner for help and they are likely to say to take the payout, because you can put the money to work and get a better result in the end; they're right, so long as they're also not giving stupid advice about what you invest in when trying to generate those superior returns.\n\nHere's what I tell everyone who gets that offer to trade a pension for a lump sum, said Stan Haithcock, known as Stan the Annuity Man. About 80% of the time, the issuing company has a higher payout than you could get on the street, meaning you are better off sticking with the pension.\n\nHaithcock said that if the pension was going to generate retirement income of $3,000 per month, the person considering a lump-sum offer should see if the big payout could buy an annuity that replaces or improves upon the pension payout.\n\nDo an apples-to-apples comparison to at least see if the lump-sum offer is a good one, Haithcock said. You have other decisions to make about what you might be able to do if you invest the lump-sum and in evaluating the safety of your pension and the company's ability to pay it, but start with a direct comparison of what you can get with the money they are offering you.\n\nIn the end, there's not really a right or wrong decision, so much as mistakes that lottery winners and ordinary workers with pension benefits want to avoid. Ultimately, it's important to consider the choices rather than lunging at the fast-cash-now option. After all, the odds of having any additional jackpots are even longer than the chances you have with a big choice on a lump sum in the first place.\n\nRead:America's biggest Powerball players live in this little state
Marijuana sales have been anything but slow.\n\nSales of recreational cannabis — which is legal in Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia — grew 184% year over year, from $351 million in 2014 to $998 million in 2015, according to a report by cannabis analytics firm New Frontier and Arcview Market Research. The report estimates that the recreational and medical industry is worth about $5.4 billion — up from $4.6 billion in 2014 — and will continue to grow by 30% annually. Oregon, Alaska and Washington, D.C. were the most recent states to legalize recreational cannabis during the November 2014 elections.\n\nMarijuana is federally illegal and classified as a Schedule I drug, meaning it is determined to have no accepted medical value and is highly abusive, along with heroin and LSD, however medical cannabis is legal in 23 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nTo put this in context, similar so-called vice markets like alcohol and tobacco are both federally legal and have become large national markets. Wine and spirits wholesalers, which only sell to licensed retail outlets, were estimated to generate $75 billion in revenue, according to an October 2015 report by research firm IBISWorld, while beer, wine and liquor stores, which sell directly to consumers (this excludes grocery stores and gas stations), generated about $48 billion. Tobacco was estimated to be a $43 billion market in a September 2015 report by IBISWorld. Brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturing was worth about $149 billion, according to a November 2015 report by IBISWorld.\n\nSuper Bowl 50: Mini ad\n\nColorado, which began recreational sales in January 2014, and Washington state, which began recreational sales in July 2014, drove much of the industry growth, according to the report. Colorado tax revenue for medical and recreational sales is expected to be $135 million for 2015 — up 77% from the $76 million in revenue in 2014 — and Washington received $70 million in tax revenue.\n\nPositive public opinion for legalization will help keep legal sales on a fast pace, the report states. An October 2015 Gallup poll found that 58% of Americans support recreational marijuana legalization and 81% of Americans support legalization for medical purposes, according to a May 2015 Harris poll.\n\nSeven states, including California, Nevada, Arizona, Massachusetts, Maine, Rhode Island and Vermont, are slated to decide on recreational legalization this year, and Florida, Ohio, Missouri and Pennsylvania will vote on medical legalization measures.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is drawing attention for suggesting that the wealthiest Americans ought to pay a marginal tax rate of as high as 70% in order to fund a Green New Deal.\n\nThe freshly seated Democratic congresswoman from New York City noted there is historical precedent for a high tax rate for the superwealthy, as she said the following:\n\n 'You look at our tax rates back in the '60s, and when you have a progressive tax-rate system, your tax rate, let's say, from $0 to $75,000 may be 10% or 15%, etc. But once you get to the tippy tops, on your 10 millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60% or 70%.'  — Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\n\nHer remarks came in an interview with Anderson Cooper for the CBS show 60 Minutes. Excerpts for her appearance were released Friday ahead of a full broadcast Sunday evening.\n\nThat doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more, said the lawmaker, who also got attention this week thanks to a dance video from her college years that went viral.\n\nWhen Cooper said Ocasio-Cortez's agenda is radical as compared with how politics is currently practiced, the 29-year-old congresswoman, whose district includes portions of the boroughs of the Bronx and Queens, embraced that word.\n\nIt only has ever been radicals that have changed this country, she said. Abraham Lincoln made the radical decision to sign the Emancipation Proclamation. Franklin Delano Roosevelt made the radical decision to embark on establishing programs like Social Security.\n\nIf that's what radical means, call me a radical.\n\nRead more:Ocasio-Cortez slams budget rule pushed by Democratic leaders\n\nThe term Green New Deal refers to a stimulus program backed by many progressives that intends to address both climate change and economic inequality.\n\nHouse Democrats on Thursday created a new select committee on climate change, but it has been denounced by environmental activists preferring a bolder approach.\n\nThis report was first published on Jan. 4, 2019.
It could be a classic sell the fact moment for the stock market.\n\nA postelection rally that carried the Dow Jones Industrial Average within a whisker of a round-number milestone and took other major indexes to all-time highs might be losing steam, leading some analysts to anticipate a near-term top that could roughly coincide with the inauguration of Donald Trump on Jan. 20.\n\nExpectations that the president-elect's administration will follow through on pledges to slash regulation, cut corporate taxes and boost infrastructure spending have contributed to the Trump trade, boosting stocks and triggering a sharp rotation into sectors expected to draw outsize benefit from those policies. Government bonds, like the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.711% , sold off sharply on expectations for bigger deficits, stronger growth and higher inflation.\n\nOf course, there's also the possibility that a building consensus for an inauguration day top turns out to be a contrarian indicator of its own.\n\nBut there are signs the Trump trade is losing some of its mojo.\n\nSee:Here's the right way for stock-market investors to trade Trump in 2017\n\nBonds have partially rebounded, pulling yields down somewhat. Stocks pulled back modestly on Monday. The S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% finished last week up more than 6% from its Election Day close, while the Dow DJIA, -0.46% on Friday topped out just 0.37 point short of the technically insignificant but possibly emotionally relevant 20,000 level.\n\nRead:What Dow 20,000 means for stock-market investors\n\nMoreover, analysts pointed to weakening stock-market breadth, with declining stocks outnumbering advancing stocks, at the end of last week even as the S&P 500 index notched a record:\n\nAlso:\n\nAndrew Adams, analyst at Raymond James, also noted that while the S&P 500, which is weighted by market capitalization, notched a record, the same index didn't follow suit when all its components are given an equal rating (see chart below). Also, small-cap stocks, which led the postelection charge, have lost some of their fizz.\n\nRaymond James\n\nAll in all, market breadth does seem to be slumping a bit, which is often a preamble to weakness in the major averages, and we could start to see traders position themselves for [a] short-term trading top coinciding with the inauguration, Adams said, in a note.\n\nThat means investors looking to take profits and reduce equity exposure might have a good opportunity to do so this week, he said.\n\nThe anticipated weakness shouldn't have any significant impact for more long-term investors, and those who missed out on the postelection rally might finally have a chance to buy in, but it is cause to remain vigilant, Adams said.\n\nHe noted that he still sees a big test for the S&P 500 at the 2,280-to-2,285 area, arguing that failure to rise above that resistance area could make for limited upside in the near term.\n\nSee:Stock-market bulls could get scorched by 'Icarus trade' in 2017\n\nA top near inauguration day would be a textbook illustration of the old investment adage: buy the rumor, sell the fact. The saying reflects the notion that by the time an anticipated event occurs, investors have already factored it into prices.\n\nIndeed, that's largely the argument made by Morgan Stanley analysts last week. What increasingly optimistic news are going to start embedding in our earnings outlook post-inauguration that hasn't already been contemplated, analysts led by Adam Parker said in a note.\n\nThere is also the concern that Trump-inspired gains have factored in all the policy positives while ignoring the potential pitfalls that could accompany rising trade tensions with China and others.\n\nAnd skeptics question whether the perceived positives are as bullish as investors assume.\n\nYou can't sit on the sidelines as the Trump rally continues, but you have good reason to question its durability, wrote analysts at Montreal-based Pavilion, in a Monday note. The president-elect's tax plan will do little to boost growth, and will largely benefit high earners, crimping consumption and dramatically eroding fiscal balances.\n\nSo far, the S&P 500 is on track to post its largest Election Day-to-Inauguration Day rise since Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election victory, which saw an 8.8% rally.\n\nSee:How stocks have performed between Election Day and inauguration since 1928\n\nTrump-inspired bulls are confident that the incoming president's policies will boost business confidence and unleash animal spirits, clearing the way for further upside.\n\nI think President Trump is going to downsize government, cut out many of our 'free lunch' programs and provide growth through the decrease in corporate and personal taxes and the closing of many tax loopholes, said Mark Grant, chief strategist at Hilltop Securities, in a Monday note.  I also believe that we will be exporting oil and natural gas in short order and that those revenues will help close the funding gap as new infrastructure projects are initiated.\n\nKirk Spano:The Trump trade and why oil might soon reach $100 again
White House spokesman Josh Earnest suggested Tuesday that a border tax on imported cars, backed earlier in the day by President-elect Donald Trump, would be the worst policy for the U.S. economy and consumers.\n\nIn a tweet, Trump took aim at General Motors Co, saying the auto-maker needs to be taxed on certain versions of the Chevrolet Cruze small car that it imports from Mexico to U.S. dealers.
The investment boom that began in 2016 is fading fast, quashing the never-realistic hopes of Republicans that the corporate tax cut had permanently transformed the economy for the better.\n\nThere's good reason to believe that the tax cut had almost no impact on business investment. Rather, it was strong demand, especially for oil, that encouraged businesses to expand capacity. Now investment is softening along with aggregate demand.\n\nA year ago, Republicans were predicting that their big tax cut for businesses would create a virtuous cycle of higher fixed investment, leading to higher growth rates lasting for years.\n\nA month ago, White House economist Kevin Hassett was insisting that everything was still going as planned. He declared that companies were investing more in equipment, software and facilities, enough to propel U.S. potential growth from an anemic 2% to a stellar 3% or more.\n\nAs he often is, Hassett was too cheery.\n\nNow, hopes that the investment boom would continue into 2019 are in tatters, victim to four factors that are dragging on the economy: reduced fiscal stimulus (including the shutdown), a weakening global economy, the uncertainty of Donald Trump's trade policy and soft oil prices.\n\nCapex plans scaled back\n\nThose four interrelated trends are weighing on aggregate demand in the U.S. and global economies, forcing companies to scale back their investment plans. It's already visible in the data and in surveys of business expectations.\n\nIt's important to define terms from the start. When economists talk about investment, they aren't talking about putting money into the stock market. They are talking about building and maintaining productive assets that will continue to create value for years.\n\nThere are three broad classes of fixed investment: structures, such as factories, oil wells and housing; equipment, such as machinery, airplanes and computers; and intellectual property, such as software, new drugs, and blockbuster Hollywood movies.\n\nAlso read:The 15 U.S. companies that are investing the most in tomorrow's big ideas\n\nBusinesses invest when they believe demand for their products will rise. Right now, fewer companies are confident of that future revenue. Most of the leading indicators of demand are slumping as the new year begins.\n\nSurveys of manufacturing executives show that the giddy optimism of early 2018 has turned to caution. The new orders component of the ISM manufacturing index, for instance, plunged 11 points in December. Company guidance, U.S. regional surveys and global purchasing managers surveys are telling the same story: Companies are scaling back their plans for capital spending.\n\nEconomists at Morgan Stanley say their capex plans index (which is based on the regional Fed surveys of capital-spending expectations) has fallen in eight of the past nine months to the lowest level in a year.\n\nThe continued softening in the index indicates restrained capital spending activity in 2019 as the shine of tax stimulus fades, and slower global growth, uncertainty around trade policy, and tighter financial conditions weigh on investment plans, said Morgan Stanley economist Molly Wharton in a note to clients.\n\nHard data also show that capital spending is softening. Real business investment surged at a 10% annual pace in the first half of the year, but slowed to 2.5% in the third quarter. Core capital equipment orders and shipments slowed through November, and private nonresidential construction spending has also weakened.\n\nUnfortunately, the government shutdown means this key data isn't being reported or collected. It's never a good time to fly blind, doubly so now.\n\nImpact of oil prices\n\nThere's something else going on besides weak aggregate demand: The impact of oil prices on U.S. investment is underappreciated.\n\nIt used to be that changes in oil prices mainly affected consumption — lower prices boosted the economy by making energy consumers richer, while higher prices frequently led to recessions. But since the fracking revolution earlier in this decade, changes in oil prices have become highly correlated with changes in investment.\n\nTraditional oil production is based on long-lasting projects requiring huge investments of hundreds of millions of dollars. The analysis of the profitability of, say, an offshore drilling project doesn't depend on spot crude oil prices US:CLG9, but on prices expected for the duration of the project's life. Temporary fluctuations in oil prices won't affect this kind of investment.\n\nBut producing oil from shale is different in an important way: The investments are much smaller (less than $10 million per well), production can ramp up quickly, and the productive life of any well is much shorter. This means the profitability of investing in a shale-fracking project depends on expected oil prices over the next few years.\n\nThat creates a lot of volatility in oil-field investment. High prices attract a lot of investment, but when prices fall, as they did in 2014 and 2015, investment collapses. The dip in U.S. growth rates in 2015 and 2016 was largely due to the impact of lower oil prices on business investment.\n\nOil accounted for all growth\n\nAfter a study of county-level economic data, Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS Securities, concluded that the increase in oil prices was responsible for much of the rebound in fixed investment in 2017, including investments in drilling equipment, storage tanks, pipes, machinery, vehicles, worker housing, and the equipment needed to supply the required sand and water.\n\nAlexander Arnon of the Penn Wharton Budget Model estimated in a blog post titled The Price of Oil is Now a Key Driver of Business Investment that firmer oil prices accounted for almost all of the growth in investment in 2018.\n\nMost oil investments aren't profitable if the price falls much below $50 a barrel. Dallas Federal Reserve\n\nUnfortunately, oil prices have fallen again. Oil prices, which were near $70 in October, fell to $43 in mid-December and are now around $52. That's right at the midpoint of profitability for most fracking projects, according to the Dallas Fed's Energy Survey.\n\nThe current level of oil prices puts energy investment on a cusp, wrote Carpenter of UBS. Further declines in the price of West Texas Intermediate are likely to have a substantively negative effect on energy's contribution to U.S. GDP.\n\nManufacturers in the Dallas and Kansas City Federal Reserve districts have noticed, Morgan Stanley's Wharton points out. Declining oil prices are a concern going into the first quarter of 2019, one fabricated metal product manufacturer told the Dallas Fed in December. About half of energy firms in the district have lowered their capital spending plans for 2019.\n\nLikewise, oil and gas drilling activity in the Minneapolis Fed district slowed notably recently in response to a rapid decline in the price of crude oil, according to the latest Beige Book. An industry contact reported that expectations for capital expenditures in the Bakken oil patch have shifted downward dramatically.\n\nThe incentives in the 2017 tax cut had almost nothing to do with the investment boom we saw in 2017 and 2018, which helps explain why many corporate executives and macro-economists don't think the tax cut transformed the economy at all.\n\nFor instance, IHS Markit is predicting that U.S. gross domestic product will fade from 2.9% in 2018 to 1.4% in 2023. The Federal Reserve, the Congressional Budget Office, the IMF and other forecasters agree that the tax cut was a temporary jolt, not a game-changer.\n\nThe U.S. economy needs a higher rate of productivity if we want living standards to improve. The tax cut didn't change the weak trend in business investment. Maybe it's time to invest more public money into transportation, alternative energy, education and health care to increase the nation's capital stock and boost our growth rate.
If you're the pessimistic type looking for an excuse to sell stocks, it may be lurking in short interest numbers, according to Bespoke Investing Group.\n\nShort interest is the quantity of shares investors have borrowed and sold on the open market in expectation the price will fall.\n\nGenerally, stocks that have been the most unloved and that have suffered the most in the preceding month perform best in rising markets, according to Bespoke. But that has not been the case so far this year.\n\nAnalysts at Bespoke looked at the year-to-date performance of the 20 most-unloved stocks in the S&P 1500 that have seen 30% or more of their free-floating shares sold short over the past month.\n\nEven though equities have rallied so far this year, the most heavily shorted stocks haven't taken part in the rally. The average return of the 20 stocks listed is a decline of 1.47% (median: -1.08%). In terms of breadth, it's a more even split with nine stocks up and 11 down, but still skewed negative, the note said.\n\nIf this trend of underperformance continues, it would be a cause for concern for the broader market, Bespoke said.\n\nBy most definitions, the broader market has done well so far this year. The S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% is up 1.7% on top of a 9.5% gain in 2016, where most gains came after Donald Trump's Nov. 8 presidential election victory.\n\nDuring the final weeks of 2016, the so-called Trump rally was led by financials, technology and industrials sectors, as investors bet that the new administration's expected policies, including tax cuts, deregulation and spending on infrastructure would benefit cyclical and growth-oriented companies.\n\nSectors that did poorly over the past quarter, such as real estate and consumer staples and health care, continue to lag behind the market.\n\nBut the lack of detail has prompted market participants to evaluate whether double-digit gains were justified, with stock prices moving sideways over the past week.\n\nSee:Investors are bracing for a massive stock-market selloff
At the end of 2017, I made some predictions for 2018 — and I'm back with my crystal ball to do so again for the year ahead.\n\nSome of my predictions last year held true, including a crash for bitcoin and a tumble for oil. However, other forecasts turned out to be wildly off base, including high hopes for biotechs and a prediction of a modest rally in the broader S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% .\n\nHey, you can't win them all.\n\nBesides, prediction listicles like this one are as much about highlighting the important issues facing investors as they are about me staking a claim on a trend or investment theme. Even if you disagree with the calls themselves, hopefully you at least think about the other side of the trade and prepare your portfolio accordingly for the year ahead.\n\nHere are my 10 bold and perhaps unpopular predictions for the market in 2019:\n\nApple doesn't recover. Now that Apple's stock AAPL, +1.27% has slumped about 40% from its 52-week high a few months ago, many so-called value investors are urging you to buy at these prices and be patient for an inevitable rebound. But as iPhone revenues had already been flatlining, U.S. consumers wary of high price tags and the trade war far from over, don't expect that rebound in 2019.\n\nRead:Apple investors get burned for holding on too long, says Mark Hulbert\n\nTesla is stuck in neutral. Perhaps surprisingly, Tesla TSLA, -4.39% has been pretty stable over the last 12 months. In addition to general volatility on Wall Street, there were lots of fireworks around its Model 3 launch, an SEC lawsuit against Elon Musk and a host of other shenanigans in 2018. Though this is encouraging to some, I expect that to continue in 2019 as continued competition from legacy auto makers makes growth harder for Tesla, and generally cheap gas prices and weak auto sales in the U.S. keep the electric-vehicle revolution from really hitting top gear.\n\nRead:The Tesla Model Y will be unveiled this year — here are the latest updates\n\nBig Tech stays on the outs. While social media and the mobile revolution were great narratives in the last few years, fueling massive gains for the FAANGs and other high-profile tech stocks, the bloom is off the rose. From privacy concerns about Facebook FB, +2.02% to peak smartphone to a general decline in tech worship as Silicon Valley culture has been increasingly exposed as reckless and misogynist, it will be harder for Big Tech to rely on vague growth narratives and investor goodwill to support nosebleed valuations in 2019.\n\nPot stocks implode. Remember all those aggressive pitches for bitcoin during the run-up to almost $20,000, and notice how they have evaporated? Expect the same thing to happen in the investing bubble that is marijuana stocks. I certainly don't begrudge traders who made money in picks like Tilray TLRY, -11.47% or Canopy Growth CGC, -5.15% last year. But the momentum looks to be moving to the downside, with a lot of pain in store for these stocks in 2019.\n\nRead:The 'hostile' takeover offer for cannabis company Aphria is littered with red flags\n\nIndia stocks surge.

Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B, -1.22% BRK.A, -0.95% already has plenty of history in making big deals, including the 2013 one with 3G Capital to take Heinz private for $23 billion or the 2009 deal to snap up railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe for $27 billion.

Treasury prices edged lower Thursday, pushing up yields as investors digested data on jobless claims and private-sector payrolls a day ahead of the December U.S. jobs report.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.682% pared an earlier rise to end at 2.452%, up around 0.7 basis point, while the 2-year note yield TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.149% rose 2 basis points to 1.955%. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.402% rose marginally to 2.783%.\n\nYields and debt prices move in opposite directions.\n\nWhat's driving the market?\n\nTreasury yields declined Wednesday after minutes from the Federal Reserve's December meeting highlighted divisions over the pace of future monetary tightening.\n\nAttention on Thursday shifted to the labor market as investors digested private-sector employment data from payroll-services firm ADP and awaited data on weekly jobless claims, with yields extending their rise after a robust reading from ADP. The main event, however, is likely to be the December jobs report in less than 24 hours.\n\nWhat are analysts saying?\n\nSome economists warned against reading too much into a strong ADP reading. Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies, argued in a note that while the correlation between ADP data and official data on private payrolls have periodically improved, the relationship is simply not reliable.\n\nThere have been a number of big misses in 2017, the most significant being in March when ADP payrolls rose 255K and BLS private payrolls rose just 59K, he said, in a note. In 2017, the average absolute error was roughly 49,000, he said.\n\nWhen it comes to the December jobs report, the real focus will be on wages where the expectation is for a 0.3% increase in average hourly earnings. Recent strength in data combined with the passage of the tax reform package should support our call for higher yields and a modest steepening of the curve over the medium term, wrote analysts at Société Générale, in a note.\n\nRead:Lack of wage growth will likely dampen celebration of December jobs report\n\nWhat does economic data say?\n\nADP said private-sector payrolls rose 250,000 in December. First time jobless claims in the week ended Dec. 30 came in at 250,000 versus a revised 248,000 a week earlier. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had forecast 240,000 initial claims.\n\nFriday's jobs data is expected to show a rise of 198,000 in December nonfarm payrolls after a 228,000 rise in November. The unemployment rate is forecast to remain steady at 4.1%, while average hourly earnings are forecast to rise 0.3% after a 0.2% rise in November.\n\nRead:Hiring like it's 1999: U.S. jobs market hasn't been this good in decades
Americans have a savings crisis on their hands.\n\nRoughly 40% of Americans don't have enough in savings to cover an unexpected $400 expense, according to a report released in May by the Federal Reserve. And a separate report by personal-finance website Bankrate found that one in five Americans have more credit-card debt than they do in emergency savings.\n\nMeanwhile, a post from MarketWatch that suggested consumers should ideally save twice their salary by the time they're 35 set Twitter TWTR, -1.47% ablaze as users balked at how lofty a task that seemed to be.\n\nBut saving money doesn't have to be difficult. Indeed, by taking just a few simple steps, consumers can easily start building that nest egg — or at least an emergency fund. Here are five New Year's resolutions to put you on the path to building up savings and creating a strong foundation for your financial futures.\n\nRead more:From solar panels to changing your diet — 11 ways you can combat climate change\n\nStop ordering in food\n\nAs one Reddit user recently discovered, ordering food to be delivered rather than cooking at home can become quite the budget buster. The Reddit user, whose handle is Cottoncandyskylines, described how a once-a-week Burger King QSR, -0.09% habit morphed into ordering food daily using apps like Skip the Dishes and Uber Eats.\n\nAll told, the user found themselves spending around $900 a month on food. With some self-motivation, they've managed to cut that amount markedly in recent months to just $150. I now have over $5,000 in savings and there's potential for so much more if I can keep cutting food expenses, they wrote.\n\nThat Reddit user is not alone. A recent study from meal-kit subscription service Home Chef found that Americans spend roughly $70,000 on food takeout and delivery over their lifetimes on average. It can be a hard habit to break, in part because food delivery services don't make deleting your account easy.\n\nBut there are ways to curb one's bad eating habits beyond deleting their food delivery accounts and simply cooking more. For starters, consumers can make sure that their credit card numbers and other personal information aren't saved in their food delivery accounts. That way ordering food will take longer, giving them time to consider whether it's really a good idea.\n\nAnother option, as some Reddit users suggested, is to order groceries instead. While consumers will still be paying a fee in this case, making grocery shopping easier can save a consumer significantly in the long run. Plus, cooking your own food is healthier, which has its own financial benefits.\n\n— Jacob Passy\n\nComparison shop when it comes to your car\n\nA little bit of research can go a long way for consumers eyeing a new car in 2019. The prices dealers offer are not necessarily set in stone — the auto industry wouldn't dub possible price tags as the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price for nothing.\n\nSites like Kelley Blue Book, Edmunds and TrueCar can all be useful guides on the going prices for vehicles.\n\nEric Lyman, senior vice president of industry insights at TrueCar, previously told MarketWatch, that in addition to the price research, drivers should also pay attention to auto loan rates. The rates are expected to climb in the new year due to the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike.\n\nBefore talking numbers with a dealer, Lyman recommended shoppers get a quote for an auto loan from financial institutions they have worked with in the past for other banking needs. Dealers may be able to work with a car maker's affiliated lenders to match or beat those loan terms, Lyman said.\n\nThe same thinking on comparison shopping applies to car insurance policies. Websites like NerdWallet.com and Compare.com aggregate price quotes for drivers. Not all drivers are created equal in the eyes of insurers.\n\nFor example, millennial drivers living with their parents typically pay far higher annual premiums ($1,750) versus other demographics, a Compare.com study determined. But those price premiums are just the average, according to the website's CEO, Andrew Rose. That makes shopping around all the more important, he said.\n\n— Andrew Keshner\n\nAlso see:How to give gifts that truly pay off for friends and family\n\nTalk to your doctor about your healthcare costs\n\nMedical bills can get expensive, but patients sometimes have more control over these costs than they realize. Patients can cut costs simply by asking their health practitioners questions, starting with whether a doctor and their affiliated labs — where a doctor may send you to get tests — are in network. Healthcare professionals belong to networks, and though patients can see doctors outside of their network, it will cost more.\n\nPatients may mistakenly assume that any specialist their doctor refers them to is in-network, but that's not always the case. Unfortunately, patients might not know this until a surprise bill comes in the mail.\n\nPatients could even save money on their medications by asking doctors and pharmacists about less-expensive versions. Many Americans assume medical expenses at set at a fixed price, but they're not, and patients can comparison shop to reduce costs. Patients can lose thousands of dollars a year by not looking around before going with a medical procedure or prescription, researchers at Harvard, Yale and Columbia Universities found. Fewer than 1% of individuals used price transparency tools, including websites or apps, to find the best prices for medical procedures and medications.\n\nIt beats the alternative, which is avoiding medical visits, procedures and medications because they're too expensive. One in four Americans has refused medical care because of the cost, a 2017 study from Bankrate.com found, but doing so could lead to worse health and other medical issues in the future.\n\nAmericans can save even more with tax-advantaged health plans. Some employers offer health savings accounts (or HSAs), which offer tax-free contributions, growth and withdrawals. Workers must have a high-deductible health plan to qualify however (which means they'd be paying more up front for their medical expenses before the insurer begins covering costs). Flexible Spending Accounts allow employees to contribute a specific amount of their salary upfront, and then use that money to spend tax-free on medical expenses throughout the year. Money in an FSA must be used before the end of the year or will be forfeited.\n\n— Alessandra Malito\n\nPay attention to interest rates\n\nThe Federal Reserve has increased interest rates multiple times throughout 2018 and plans to hike rates further in the year ahead. Consumers can do themselves a favor by staying abreast of how rising interest rates will affect them.\n\nAmericans had more than $420 billion in credit card debt as of late 2018, according to personal finance website NerdWallet, and the average household with credit-card debt has nearly $7,000 in revolving debt that carries over from month to month. And those households are paying a hefty sum in interest.\n\nCredit card rates have risen steadily over the past year, as have the rates for other types of loans. The average annual percentage rate for credit cards was 17.21% as of Dec. 19, nearly a full percentage point higher than the previous year, according to CreditCards.com. Therefore, households could stand to save thousands of dollars by avoiding pay credit card interest.\n\nBeyond paying off their full card balance each month, consumers can achieve this by applying for a balance-transfer credit card with a 0% interest introductory offer. These cards give consumers a chance to pay off their debts without digging themselves into a hole via interest payments.\n\nAdditionally, consumers should be aware how much interest they're earning on their banks accounts. Stock-trading platform Robinhood made a huge splash in December when it announced banking accounts that were set to earn 3% interest. Though the company has since delayed the rollout of these accounts amid regulatory scrutiny, the public's enthusiastic reaction to the announcement — some 850,000 people joined a waitlist for the accounts — shows that Americans are hungry to earn interest on their cash.\n\nWhile accounts earning 3% are hard to come by, consumers should investigate ways to earn more in interest. For instance, many online banks offer above 2% interest on their accounts. Another option is to take out a certificate of deposit — many banks offer 1-year CDs with annual percentage yields above 2.5%.\n\n— Jacob Passy

Shares of big banks have been on a tear since mid-2017 as investors began to anticipate a better business environment thanks to an improving global economy and business-friendly policies from Washington.\n\nBut—and there's always a but with bank earnings, it seems—fourth-quarter earnings season started with a slog, and that's likely to continue.\n\nFor the quarter, most banks will be recording big, one-time charges that stem from the tax overhaul, as MarketWatch's Francine McKenna has reported. (For a sense of just how muddied earnings will be, J.P. Morgan estimates per-share losses at Citigroup C, +0.33% of $6.07 because of the tax changes, versus per-share earnings of $1.22 with the tax hit stripped out.)\n\nWe expect investors to look through these one-time items and focus on core results, said Jason Goldberg, Barclays' bank analyst team leader.\n\nRead: Banks are beginning to admit a new rule on revenue recognition will have an impact\n\nEven better, KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl says, it's possible that Wall Street hasn't fully priced in the full impact of the tax cuts. When I look out across consensus estimates I don't think it's fully incorporated, Kleinhanzl said in an interview. A lot of it is priced in, but there could be a little more upside.\n\nBut banks' business fundamentals aren't going to light any fires, and investors will face another quarter of determining whether the same promise that's been made for years now—stronger economic growth, a brisker pace of lending, less regulation, and a better spread between interest rates—is truly right around the corner, or if they should expect more of the same.\n\nOn Friday, J.P.Morgan Chase JPM, +1.65% and Wells Fargo WFC, +2.43% both reported earnings that beat analyst expectations, but showed messy and mixed results, at best.\n\nRead:As promised, big bank earnings were messy, but CEOs keep faith in tax cuts\n\nThe important themes for the quarter, wrote J.P. Morgan's Vivek Juneja, include a benefit from big share buybacks, offset by loan growth that's weak, net interest margins that are flattish, a moderate increase in investment banking fees, and trading revenues that are weak.\n\nStill, Goldberg thinks that once the final quarter of 2017 is in the rearview mirror, 2018 will be constructive with stronger growth in both loans and net interest margins, as well as a supportive backdrop for buying back shares.\n\nKleinhanzl agrees. Tax reform is just one piece of it. There's further potential for deregulation, it's just going to build over the course of the year, he told MarketWatch. It's a compounding effect across multiple areas that's going to cause the group to rally.\n\nThat said, Kleinhanzl thinks it's possible that bank management will keep their cards close during earnings calls this month, with so much uncertainty about how the tax changes will impact operations. As he put it, People are expecting a lot of good news but we may not get a lot of news at all.\n\nRead:Now's the time to increase exposure to financial stocks, CFRA says\n\nHere's an overview of what it all means for earnings.\n\nLoan growth\n\nWe are skeptical of meaningful re-acceleration in industrywide loan growth, said UBS analysts in a Jan. 4 note. They forecast lending growth of 5.9% for Citigroup and 0.1% for Bank of America Corp. BAC, +2.61% , which report Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. That will be driven by commercial real estate, Juneja noted. In contrast, buoyant consumers and a blowout Christmas shopping season are boosting credit card loans—though other consumer loan types, like autos, are growing more slowly.\n\nNet interest margins\n\nTo be profitable, banks need a bigger spread between short-term interest rates — what they pay for deposits — and long-term rates, which they receive for lending. Rates — and the spread between them — became depressed in the wake of the financial crisis. When the yield curve steepens, it's because investors expect faster growth and stronger inflation.\n\nStill, that won't be much in evidence in fourth-quarter earnings. UBS forecasts net interest margins of 2.71% for Citigroup and 2.37% for Bank of America—essentially flat compared with the third quarter, though up nearly 20 basis points compared with a year ago.\n\nTrading\n\nThis will be a tough quarter for banks' trading businesses, not just because volatility remained so low during the quarter, but also because the fourth quarter of last year, when the upset presidential election caused a flurry of activity, will be so hard to match.\n\nBarclays' Goldberg expects a 15-20% annual decline in total trading revenues. Stock trading overall will outpace that in fixed income, commodities and currencies, he said.\n\nInvestment banking\n\nJuneja has penciled in year-over-year increases in investment banking fees of 1% for Bank of America, and 6% for Citigroup. That's driven by strong equity capital markets activity, but a decline in mergers and acquisitions.\n\nEarnings estimates for the coming quarter\n\nAnalysts surveyed by FactSet expect per-share earnings of $1.20 for Citigroup, up from $1.14 a year ago. That's a bit lower than Estimize, which forecasts EPS of $1.25. FactSet's revenue consensus is for $17.3 billion, just above the $17 billion booked a year ago, and Estimize's consensus is for $17.4 billion.\n\nFactSet analysts expect earnings per share of 45 cents for Bank of America, compared with 40 cents last year. Revenues of $21.5 billion are expected to top the $20 billion booked a year ago. Estimize's forecast is for 47 cents in per-share earnings and for $21.3 billion of revenues.\n\nStock performance\n\nOver the past 12 months, shares of Citigroup have risen 26%, and shares of Bank of America are up 33.2% gain over that period. Both dwarf the 21% gain in the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48%

The pandemic is inspiring drinkers to crack open a cold one, and another one, and maybe just one more.\n\nAlcohol consumption has skyrocketed in the past year, and the ways we consume it vary greatly. We've drunk out of bottles in front of the TV, out of cans and boxes at socially distanced picnics, and out of travel mugs on walks around the neighborhood.\n\nBut did you know that wine and spirits producers have had limited options for packaging their beverages?\n\nUp until last week, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) set strict regulations for standards of fill for winemakers. There were just nine options for packaging wine — 50 ml, 100 ml, 187 ml, 375 ml, 500 ml, 1 liter, 1.5 liters, 3 liters and then larger amounts in even liters. And while that might seem like a wide array of options, a few key sizes were missing.\n\nThe wine industry has been pushing regulators to allow 250 ml and 355 ml cans for years now, Michael Kaiser, the vice president of government affairs at the National Association of American Wineries, said.\n\nAs of Dec. 29, 2020, the TTB added 200 ml, 250 ml and 355 ml as acceptable sizes for wine packaging. The latter is a 12 ounce size that the industry especially wanted. The new standards of fill for wine could be used for bottles in addition to cans, although Kaiser said it's unlikely winemakers would produce a bottle that small.\n\nSee: It's not just your imagination — wine glasses are bigger than ever\n\nAdding acceptable standard fill options is better than eliminating all standards of fill completely, Kaiser said, because without any federal laws on packaging, it would be left to the states to regulate.\n\nWe really pushed the industry hard to make sure that they didn't eliminate (all standards of fill) because that would have caused a whole host of problems with interstate commerce, he said.\n\nA spokesperson from the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States said the council supported retaining the current standards of fill and adding limited additional sizes, rather than eliminating all but maximum and minimum container sizes. The new package sizes for distilled spirits are 700 ml, 720 ml, 900 ml and 1.8 liters.\n\nIn a comment filed to the TTB in 2019, the council argued that a limited expansion — rather than eliminating all standards of fill — is best for both the distilled spirits industry and consumers.\n\nThe new 250 ml size can for wine is a good single serving — it's just a little over a standard glass of wine and is comparable to a restaurant pour. In the past, Kaiser said wineries had to settle for 187 ml canned servings but would have to sell them in two- or four-packs in order to be cost effective.\n\nBut grocery stores could sell the 187 ml cans individually, which Kaiser said gave the retailers an advantage over the wineries themselves.\n\nThe new 355 ml size is particularly important, Kaiser said, because it is the size of a standard 12 ounce can of soda or beer. Although a 355 ml can might not look very different from a 375 ml can on the shelves at the liquor store, they're much easier to source. That 355 ml size was the most requested standard of fill by wineries, so Kaiser said including it in the new regulations is a win.\n\nAlthough canned wines have become more popular in recent years, he said it's still not necessarily a widespread practice.\n\nThere's a stigma that I think exists with consumers, much like with screwcaps, that it's lower quality product, Kaiser said. And he said most wineries aren't putting their higher end product in cans.\n\nNot to say that they're bad quality, but they're inexpensive products, he said.\n\nCanning in the wine industry is still a relatively new phenomenon, but the expanded canning options — and the 355 ml addition in particular — might be exactly what some wineries needed to get them to start canning.\n\nIf a winery was on the fence about canning their product, it will allow wineries who maybe didn't want to start canning to think about getting into it, he said.\n\nNew York Sen. Chuck Schumer released a statement in support of the new regulations last week, saying that the flexibility will allow New York's wine industry to be a bigger player in the nearly $200 million canned wine market.\n\nAlthough it was already a heavy-hitter, New York's $4.8 billion wine industry was left hanging on the vine by TTB's outdated rules and restrictions, Schumer said. Today's decision to allow winemakers to sell their products in the most popular-sized cans will lead to further economic growth and allow producers to capitalize on an explosive trend.\n\nA potential downside, as Kaiser points out, is that if more wineries take advantage of canning as a packaging option, it could further exacerbate the country's aluminum shortage.\n\nEven still, Kaiser said the new packaging sizes are a good sign for the wine industry.\n\nA lot of times regulations are not caught up with innovation, he said, and this is a case where they are becoming more in line with what the realities of the market are demanding and what producers can do.
Hess Corp.'s stock HES, -4.98% surged 1.6% in premarket trade Thursday, after the oil and gas exploration company said its capital and exploratory budget and production will rise in 2017. The company said the E&P capital and exploratory budget for 2017 will rise 18% from a year ago to $2.25 billion, to fund additional rigs in the Bakken, development activities in Guyana and to restart drilling in the Valhall Field in Norway. Production is expected to increase 8% to 12% from the beginning of 2017 to the end of the year. Separately, Hess said it will record a $3.8 billion noncash charge in the fourth quarter to establish valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets. The company will also take a $700 million fourth-quarter charge to impair the carrying value of interests in Equus, and $140 million in charges for rig exit costs. Hess's stock has soared 56% over the past 12 months through Wednesday, while the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF XLE, -4.49% has run up 36% and the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% has gained 17%.
HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — While China's equity turbulence appears to have temporarily paused, its main equity indices SHCOMP, +0.51% are now 15% lower since the start of the year, despite Beijing remaining committed to its policy of market intervention.\n\nIn some ways the government's hands are tied from last year's stock buying as it now has a substantial position to protect. Added to this, the original reason the party could not let its bull market die remains due to the potential political fallout from losses after it effectively orchestrated the bubble.\n\nBut in attempting to solve one problem, are policy makers just sowing the seeds of another? Attention is now turning to the collateral damage from official intervention to support stocks, in particular to the banks.\n\nChina's Wanda Buys Into Hollywood\n\nAnalysts are questioning the cost to China's state-owned yet overseas-listed banks, which have once again been called up for national service. The concern is that by acting as a buyer of last resort to prop up the stock market, this sets up China's banks to be the next fault line in the economy.\n\nIn a new report, rating agency Fitch warns of a clear conflict between banks struggling to manage state strategic roles and their profit goals.\n\nHow much intervention has come this year is still unknown, but last July after the initial stock market rout 17 banks, including the big five, were reported to have lent $200 billion.\n\nThere is also a pattern here. Last summer state-owned banks had to play another strategic role as they were strong-armed by the central government into a 3.2 trillion yuan debt-for-bond swap to help bail out local authorities.\n\nThe list of troubled assets needing help is unlikely to end there. The central government has prioritized cleaning up struggling state-owned enterprises, which, according to Societe Generale, includes some 30% that are bankrupt with 23 trillion yuan in liabilities.\n\nGiven this accumulation of questionable assets at the behest of the state, investors might feel somewhat anxious in case there ultimately is a reckoning.\n\nWhile Fitch notes these initiatives will harm profits, it does at least expect the central government rather than non-sovereign shareholders will be the banks' main source of funds if they do need additional capital.\n\nIf investors suspected that they would be forced to repeat the scenario from the global financial crisis when Western banks raised fresh capital from shareholders with deeply discounted share issues, stock prices would be vulnerable to steep falls.\n\nFitch's sanguine assumption of the central government stepping in depends on how much capital China's banks may need. Analyst Charlene Chu at Autonomous Economics, estimates this figure could be as high as $7.7 trillion of new capital in the next three years.\n\nSuch a figure would send the government debt-to-GDP ratio skyrocketing, which at around 22% is usually used to reaffirm China's robust financial position.\n\nAnother issue is that in China the overlap between corporates and the state can often make it difficult to get a true financial picture. For instance, hugely profitable state banks in recent years have by some estimates accounted for 50% of the net profits of all listed Chinese companies. This could mean if China's banks had to recognize a substantial increase in bad debts, another wild card is the impact on the central government's fiscal position through lost tax revenue.\n\nThe danger is that a possible policy misstep could compound problems if questions emerged on the government's support for the banks or its capacity to provide support.\n\nReports that the State Council is considering shaking up its various financial regulators by consolidating them, suggests that policy is still unclear.\n\nAdding to difficulties is the fact Beijing also has to navigate these challenges while facing accelerating capital outflows. Any central government cleanup of bad debt that revealed a significant deterioration in its fiscal position could heap more pressure on the yuan to weaken.\n\nAt the same time, China still has some $3.33 trillion of foreign reserves to support the yuan USDCNH, +0.32% yet it will be wary of using them up too aggressively as this contracts domestic liquidity. Authorities would be reluctant to tighten domestic monetary conditions excessively as this could hurt the property market. This remains pivotal, with estimates by analysts in the past that some 50% of banking collateral is related to real estate.\n\nIn the near term it should not be ruled out that more measures will be used to tighten capital controls. Currently, individuals can convert $50,000 per year into foreign currency.\n\nAs well as making foreign purchases of property overseas more difficult, another possibility is restrictions on Chinese tourists spending overseas.\n\nFor now Beijing's policy choice is between supporting the stock market and supporting the yuan. If it does not get this policy right, its next choice could be between supporting bank shareholders and depositors.
Democrats will have control of the Senate, the House of Representatives and the presidency come Jan. 20 — they may also be in charge of the fate of Social Security, too.\n\nThe Democratic party is often promoting proposals to expand and improve Social Security, but little has been done in recent years regarding legislation for the program, which serves as a lifeline for many older Americans. If the trust funds that support the program run out of money by 2034, as expected, beneficiaries will see cuts to their monthly checks by as much as 25%. The pandemic has the potential to make that deadline even sooner.\n\nYou don't want to wait until the 11th hour, said William Arnone, chief executive officer of the National Academy of Social Insurance. COVID-19 changes everything.\n\nSocial Security is known as the third-rail in politics — because it's highly charged and considered untouchable — and politicians typically can't agree on how to fix the program and its funding issues. Discussions around solutions can become controversial, especially considering so many people rely on the program to provide some, if not most, of their retirement income. Over the past few decades, legislators have argued over how to repair Social Security — such as raising taxes or reducing benefits.\n\nSee: Confused about Social Security — including spousal benefits, claiming strategies and how death and divorce affect your monthly income?\n\nNow that Democrats have control of the executive and both sides of the legislative branch, discussing bills focused on expanding Social Security might be more likely, says Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for expanding the program. President-elect Joe Biden has already named a few of the ways he'd fix Social Security, many of which echo proposals already in Congress, she said.\n\nDemocratic Rep. John Larson, along with Democratic senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris van Hollen, introduced the Social Security 2100 Act to the House in 2019, which suggested applying the payroll tax to earnings of $400,000 and above, as opposed to $142,800 in 2021 (or $137,700 in 2020). The donut hole between these two figures would gradually narrow every year with inflation adjustments. The proposal also recommended increasing the special minimum benefit for people with very low earnings and using the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly as opposed to the CPI-W, the index Social Security currently uses tied to urban workers. A change to the index would mean Social Security benefits would better reflect the expenses of the elderly, as opposed to younger workers today.\n\nBiden's tax plan includes the provision of applying taxes to earnings above $400,000. In his campaign, the president-elect also suggested there be a minimum benefit, so that beneficiaries who have worked 30 years get no less than 125% of the federal poverty level.\n\nThis overlap will likely contribute to a more seamless process of at least reviewing legislation in Congress, Altman said. Now that the Democrats have the gavel, they can hold hearings, mark it up and bring it to the floor, she said. Senators will also likely look at other parts of Social Security to tweak, such as one regarding the Windfall Elimination Provision, which adjusts benefits for people who receive non-covered pensions, such as teachers, firefighters, police officers and other public employees.\n\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean everything will pass quickly, efficiently and without debate. Proposed changes to Social Security require a supermajority vote, meaning there must be at least 60 votes in favor of the legislation. Although it might be easier now that the Senate is split in half, members within parties don't always agree on solutions.\n\nMaking adjustments to proposals in an attempt to attract members of the opposite side may discourage other legislators of the same party, who will then vote no to a bill, said Andrew Biggs, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Anything they try to do on Social Security has to be small and noncontroversial, he said. The problem — legislators from both sides of the aisle may have a hard time agreeing, as seen with the passage of the second stimulus package. Political parties are more divided than they used to be, Biggs said.\n\nAlso see: Thanks to COVID-19, Social Security's day of reckoning may be even closer than we thought\n\nAt the same time, the need for Congress to focus on Social Security is getting more dire, thanks in part to the pandemic. The pandemic has the potential to move the depletion date to as soon as 2024, Arnone said. You don't want to make policy in 2023 knowing the trust funds could be depleted in 2024, he said. Because of the pandemic, some Americans born in 1960 and 1961 will already see less in benefits over their lifetimes, according to an analysis from the Center for American Progress.\n\nA key to passing Social Security legislation will be in having hearings, which didn't happen in the Senate before, said Max Richtman, president and chief executive officer of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. I testified quite a few times over in the House, but that was in John Larson's Social Security committee, he said. In the Senate, we never had a hearing.\n\nRepublicans may also feel more pressure to pass bills to expand Social Security, especially if they are up for reelection in the coming years, Richtman said. It is more about momentum to get Republicans to join and have these issues become more visible, he said. There's certainly a better chance than before the 50-50 split.
Mark J. Grant, the new chief global strategist at B. Riley/FBR/Wunderlich Securities, sees a giant opportunity for income-seeking investors in natural gas partnerships.\n\nGrant, in an interview Jan. 10, revealed his five favorite plays in the industry — all closed-end funds, whose yields are as high as 13.8%. He also described a conservative income-focused strategy. Grant joined the investment manager this week after spending 43 years at other financial firms, including Hilltop Securities.\n\nLast March, I went out on a limb and said closed-end funds investing in energy pipeline partnerships (also called MLPs, or master limited partnerships) were great places to park your money, because of their discounted prices and high dividend yields.\n\nHere's how the six closed-end funds mentioned in that article have performed over the past 12 months, with dividends reinvested:\n\nClosed-end fund Ticker Total return - 12 months through Jan. 9 Current distribution yield Tortoise MLP Fund Inc. NTG, -4.89% 7% 8.99% Tortoise Energy Infrastructure Corp. TYG, -4.70% 8% 8.54% ClearBridge American Energy MLP Fund Inc. US:CBA 4% 8.97% ClearBridge Energy MLP Fund Inc. CEM, -5.61% 15% 8.52% ClearBridge Energy MLP Total Return Fund Inc. CTR, -5.21% 6% 9.25% ClearBridge Energy MLP Opportunity Fund Inc. EMO, -5.72% 6% 9.95% Source: FactSet\n\nThose 12-month returns may not be impressive to growth-oriented investors who have been pleased with the S&P 500's SPX, -1.48% 24% gain, but the point of those investments is to generate high income over long periods.\n\nMark J. Grant, chief global strategist at B. Riley/FBR/Wunderlich Securities. Mark J. Grant\n\nGrant said that, for serious money, your core money, [a better strategy is] to make sure that whatever the market does, you have money coming in.\n\nSome investors are worried the benchmark S&P 500 Index SPX, -1.48% and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% are overvalued after a nearly nine-year bull run.\n\nThe whole concept is to get the cash, so if the market goes down, you have cash to reinvest, Grant said. If you play for appreciation and you are down, then you are stuck. This way, if you are down, you have cash coming in every month or every quarter, that you can reinvest at lower prices, and theoretically, if the companies don't cut their dividends, at higher yields, he added.\n\nFavorite pipeline plays\n\nGrant named five closed-end funds that each have more than 85% of assets invested in natural gas pipeline limited partnerships. The closed-end funds have advantages over open-end mutual funds. For one thing, managers do not have to worry about investing new money coming in if the timing is unfavorable, as new shares are not created. Close-end funds can also make life simpler for investors at tax time, as they issue 1099 forms, rather than the partnerships' Schedule K-1 tax forms.\n\nWith such high yields, your first reaction may be that you're looking at red flags for dividend cuts. But according to Grant, the yields remain high because the funds are ignored by most investors.\n\nThese closed-end funds are overlooked. They are ignored by Wall Street because managers make more money with ETFs [exchange traded funds], he said.\n\nWhen oil prices began to tumble in the summer of 2014, natural gas partnership prices declined as well, even though their revenues were derived from long-term contracts to transport natural gas. Investors panicked out of fear that depressed energy prices would make future pipeline contracts less lucrative. But low natural gas prices are leading to continued production increases as the U.S. ramps up exports of liquid natural gas. This means more good times ahead for the toll-taking gas pipeline operators.\n\nSome pipeline operators have lowered their income distributions over the past few years. When asked how risky the environment is now for additional distribution cuts by MLPs, he said, generally not.\n\nHere are Grant's favorite plays in the natural gas pipeline space:\n\n• The Center Coast MLP & Infrastructure Fund CEN, -1.89% has a distribution yield of 11.73%, according to FactSet. But unlike most funds, this one distributes income monthly, which according to Grant adds 110 basis points to investors' effective yield because of compounding.\n\nClosed-end funds can borrow to invest more and generate more income. This fund is 34.6% leveraged. Open-end mutual funds quote net asset values (NAV) as share prices, as investors can only buy or sell shares at the end of each trading day. The NAV is a fund's total assets divided by the number of shares. But a closed-end fund is publicly traded, so its share price can trade at a premium or discount to NAV. The Center Coast MLP & Infrastructure Fund traded at a slight premium (0.47%) to NAV at the close Jan. 9.\n\n• The Duff & Phelps Select Energy MLP Fund DSE, -1.06% has a distribution yield of 13.84%. It pays quarterly and is leveraged by 26.6%, according to Grant. The shares traded at a slight discount to NAV on Jan. 9.\n\n• The Fiduciary/Claymore MLP Opportunity Fund FMO, -6.16% has a distribution yield of 12.22%, pays quarterly and is leveraged 28.5%. The shares traded at a slight discount to NAV on Jan. 9.\n\n• The First Trust New Opportunities MLP & Energy Fund FPL, -2.06% has a distribution yield of 9.91%. It pays monthly, is leveraged 24.6% and traded at a 4.7% premium to NAV on Jan. 9.
January is a natural time to take stock of your financial life, and to dream big dreams about 2018. Could this be the year you make the leap to homeownership? Or will you make a big change and trade in your mortgage payment for a landlord? While the housing market has slowly recovered from its dip in the 2000s, blind faith in housing gains has not. Homeownership rates hit a 50-year low in 2015, and first-time home buyers are now waiting a record six years to move from renting to buying. In fact, young adults looking to upgrade out of their one-bedroom apartments are increasingly renting single-family homes rather than buying. Single-family rentals — either detached homes or townhomes — make up the fastest-growing segment of the housing market, according to the Urban Institute.\n\nIn the complex calculus that's required for the renting vs. buying decision, one variable stands out: Which is cheaper? If that seems like a tough question to answer, there's a good reason: crunch the data from America's largest cities, and you'll learn it's a perfectly split decision. According to an Urban Institute analysis, among 33 top metropolitan areas in the U.S., there are 17 places where buying is cheaper, and 16 where renting is cheaper. Home buying is a better option for those who plan to stay in one place for 3-5 years or more. It's also a good investment in many housing markets. According to the Urban Institute, here are 16 cities where buying is cheaper.\n\n1. Miami\n\nWhile it's cheaper to buy than rent there, it would be a stretch to call the Miami housing market a bargain. A median-priced home still consumes 32% of a median earner income, above the recommended 30%.\n\n2. Detroit\n\nNot long ago, it was possible to buy a home in Detroit for well below the median home price in the U.S. The Detroit area has seen some revitalization in recent years, however, and while housing prices have gone up, it's still a better value to buy a home there than it is to rent one.\n\n3. Chicago\n\nRent in Chicago is on the rise faster than home prices. While they may level out in the near future, it's a good time to buy while you still can.\n\n4. Philadelphia\n\nRenting is significantly more expensive than buying in the City of Brotherly Love. In fact, the average wage-earner would need a 36% raise to afford the average rent there. Buying, however, is more affordable.\n\n5. Tampa, Florida\n\nFor roughly 90% of Tampa communities, renting is more expensive than buying.\n\n6. Pittsburgh\n\nThe average rent in Pittsburgh is $1250 a month, whereas the average home price is just over $145,000. Broken down, it's cheaper to buy in Pittsburgh, as your monthly mortgage will be much less expensive than the average rent.\n\nEverything we thought about millennials' money habits was wrong\n\n7. Cleveland\n\nIn this popular college town, a home buyer will save an average of $200 a month if they pay a mortgage instead of rent.\n\n8. Cincinnati\n\nHistorically speaking, it's been cheaper to rent than buy in Cincinnati based on the percentage of a person's income that went to housing costs. That number is now lower for buyers and higher for renters.\n\n9. Orlando\n\nOrlando Shutterstock\n\nIn the home of Disney World, the average monthly rent will cost you roughly double what the average comparable monthly mortgage payment will.\n\n10. Houston\n\nEven though median rents are falling in Houston, it's still cheaper to buy, especially if you plan on staying in your home for three years or more.\n\n11. San Antonio\n\nAverage monthly rent for an apartment in San Antonio will run you $1,226 (estimated as recently as December 2017). The price of a home in the area is $232,000. While the housing market is trending upward, it's still more advantageous to buy a home, especially if you plan to stay in the area for a long time.\n\n12. New York\n\nIt's no secret that home prices in the New York City area (including Newark and Jersey City) are well above the national average. However, rental prices are even higher, so if you can afford to buy property here, you'd be better off doing so rather than renting.\n\n13. Minneapolis and St. Paul\n\nThe Twin Cities are becoming an increasingly popular to destination for young families to move, so it's a good time to invest in property here instead of renting it.\n\n14. Kansas City\n\nBoth rents and housing prices are low in the Kansas City area (average rent will cost just under a thousand dollars, while the average home price is $126,100), but buying is better long-term, as it offers more benefits, including potential tax write-offs.\n\n15. Columbus, Ohio\n\nMany market experts consider Columbus a no-brainer metro area as far as buying over renting. With affordable housing on both sides, the advantage goes to buying.\n\n16. Boston\n\nWhile a buyer may need a large income (or two above-average incomes) to buy here, they'll need a slightly larger one to rent long-term.
Investing in real estate could be a smart financial decision with proper planning and budgeting. Real estate tends to appreciate in value over time, can act as a hedge against stock market volatility, offers great tax advantages and can provide a stable monthly income.\n\nAll things considered, buying property represents one of the most effective ways to build wealth but also one of the slowest. Though, once your investments start to compound, your portfolio will begin to have several income generating assets. You can reinvest the profits you make from selling previous investments and see your wealth truly begin to snowball.\n\nTo learn more about the different types of real-estate investments available to you as well as how to determine the right one for you, continue reading this comprehensive guide.\n\n1. Short-term rentals\n\nPros\n\nShort-term rental properties, otherwise known as vacation rentals, can act as one of the best ways to generate significant income from your real estate holdings. Owners can charge higher rates a day than long-term investment properties and they can also potentially use the home themselves when renters do not occupy the property.\n\nMoreover, home-sharing apps such as Airbnb and Vrbo have made vacation rentals much more accessible and easier to market than ever before.\n\nCons\n\nVacation properties can also represent one of the more expensive types of real-estate investments. They can potentially carry intensive maintenance costs as a result of excessive wear and tear. Further, you will have to clean it after each stay, which could range from every couple of weeks to every day, depending on your guest preferences.\n\nIf you do not want to get your hands dirty, you can hire a property manager, but you still need to manage your property manager to ensure the rental remains in good condition. On short-term rentals, property managers typically charge around 25% of rent as compensation, more than long-term rental property managers, discussed next.\n\nYou also run the possibility of having your short-term rental remain empty for long periods, especially during the offseason. This could lead to lost income if your budget does not reflect this eventuality.\n\n2. Long-term rentals\n\nPros\n\nBecoming a landlord and owning a long-term rental property (or several) is one of the most common ways to invest in physical real estate. Some people pay cash for their rental properties, while others use leverage to take on more risk with financing and property management. Those who can manage this portfolio appropriately have learned how to make money while you sleep.\n\nLong-term rentals provide more stability for owners than short-term because they usually come with leases lasting for a year or more. They also provide investors with a steady flow of monthly income via tenants' rent payments.\n\nCons\n\nActing as a landlord rarely comes as an easy job. You will be on the hook for maintenance, repairs and any problems that arise with the property. Like with short-term rentals, you can hire a property manager, but this can eat into your income.\n\nYou will have to depend on your tenants being reliable and making their rent payments on time. If they don't, you might have to pursue legal action. Purchasing your first long-term rental property can also require a significant amount of capital upfront, especially if you choose to pay cash for your rental properties, though financing options exist under different terms than a conventional mortgage on an owner-occupied property.\n\n3. Fix-and-flip\n\nPros\n\nFlipping houses is a great way to get started in real-estate investing if you have cash on hand.\n\nFixer-uppers provide investors with the ability to purchase properties in neighborhoods that might otherwise be out of their price range because the home is in need of repair. They hold the potential to turn a significant profit, especially for handy individuals who can tackle most of the renovations on their own.\n\nMoreover, if you find an off-market property that looks like it's in bad shape, you may be able to approach the owner directly and close the sale without a Realtor (and avoid commission fees). If you have interest in accelerating the growth of your real-estate investment portfolio, you might consider pursuing the BRRRR method, a strategy reliant on uncovering hidden gems and rehabbing them.\n\nCons\n\nFlipping a fixer-upper is a big responsibility and will require a lot of time, money and effort. The process is very intensive, and you will be involved in everything from choosing paint colors to making major repairs. Basically, if you are a passive investor, these types of properties are not for you.\n\nBuying an outdated property in the hopes of turning a profit can also quickly go wrong if the house has more damage than you initially expected. You will also likely need to obtain a hard money loan using the property as collateral, as opposed to funding the purchase with a mortgage.\n\nHard money loans have higher interest rates (between 7% to 12%) and shorter repayment periods (usually 6 to 18 months). Although higher rates are offset by quick turnaround times, if it takes too long to sell the property, you could run the risk of defaulting on the loan and losing the property altogether.\n\n4. Commercial real estate\n\nPros\n\nInvesting in commercial real estate carries high risks, but also high rewards. Owning an office or retail space allows you to rent out to businesses with lease terms typically much longer than residential rentals. Plus, rental rates usually come in higher on commercial properties.\n\nCons\n\nCommercial real estate almost always comes with a higher price tag than residential real estate. As a result, you will need to save a large sum of money before moving forward. You will also probably need to hire professional help to run the property as well as to handle emergency maintenance and repairs.\n\nThese investments carry higher risk because more people visit them each day, which means more people have chances to get hurt on the property (and sue). They can also more easily damage and vandalize the property on account of higher foot traffic.\n\n5. REITs\n\nPros\n\nIf you want to make a passive real-estate investment, then real-estate investment trusts (REITs) can serve as a great option.\n\nREITs are individual companies that own commercial properties such as hotels, apartments, office buildings and retail spaces. These investments usually pay high dividends and get used regularly in retirement funds. They do so because by keeping your REITs in a nontaxable retirement account, you can automatically reinvest your dividends without a tax consequence, allowing your money to grow even further.\n\nCons\n\nAlthough some REITs are publicly traded on an exchange similar to stocks, others are not. REITs that are not publicly traded are difficult to sell and harder to value.

In the same way that the automobile was a big unknown in the days of horse-drawn carriages, cryptocurrencies are unknown in today's world of cash, gold, and credit cards. But it would be a grave mistake for government regulators to overreach and delay this innovation from reaching its potential.\n\nBitcoin BTCUSD, +1.00% prices tumbled at one point in January on reports that South Korea would ban cryptocurrency trading — a threat that has since been calmed. But this trading scare underscores regulators' reasonable concerns about cryptocurrencies. How do you report and audit taxes? There is potential for outright fraud. Uninformed investors may unwisely invest their life savings into currencies that will become worthless. Security breaches in the exchanges could lead to massive thefts of wealth from investors. Perhaps most disturbingly, there is a legitimate concern that criminals and terrorist groups are using anonymized exchanges to move capital.\n\nLawmakers are justified in wanting to bring order to this madness to protect their citizens (and their tax base). The innovators in this space also want some clarifications from the regulatory community that will provide certainty and enable institutional investors to comfortably deploy their capital.\n\nSo there is a need for a baseline regulatory framework, as well as oversight, that legitimizes crypto-assets. This framework should outline principles for market participants to follow, and to begin to craft a strategy for tax treatment, but should avoid placing onerous filing or licensing burdens on the participants, thus allowing the market to evolve.\n\nRead: Here's how the U.S. and the world regulate bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\n\nAlso: Why bitcoin is worth exactly $0 (and blockchain might be very valuable)\n\nLaws like those in New York, requiring a BitLicense for cryptocurrency activity with a large legal, compliance and filing cost, are a mistake and will only protect incumbents and drive innovation away. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ruling that the cryptocurrencies issued by Initial Coin Offerings are securities and need to be registered will drive these issuances overseas (probably to Japan and Singapore with their supportive regulatory regime) and the U.S. innovators and investors may not be able to participate.\n\nGundlach: What 'Trumponomics' means for stocks in 2018\n\nRegulators would do well to get extensive feedback from sophisticated investors and innovators who understand crytocurrencies and their possible uses, as these sorts of developments are as unknown and incapable of being understood by policymakers today as the automobile was at the turn of the 20th Century. Specifically, we are attempting to regulate a decentralized network of trust that has never existed before, and must resist impulses to treat it like a centralized network, where if the intermediary (e.g. bank) is protected, the system remains safe. In this crypto-world, with no central intermediary, it will be only possible to understand how to properly regulate once the industry matures a bit and has found a purpose in the economy.\n\n It would be an irrevocable mistake to wave a red flag in front of the next potential Google or Facebook \n\nThere are lessons from the rapid acceptance of the internet when considering legislating the cryptocurrencies. The permission-less innovation with respect to the internet was one of the keys to its success. Imagine how much progress would have been delayed — or crippled — if web developers had been forced to acquire a license to set up each new site. Security issues and other sinister uses of the web were not a deterrent to its use, but a business opportunity to encourage the market to develop products to protect privacy and tackle fraud.\n\nIn a short time, people have gone from reluctance to share credit-card information on the web to depositing checks with a smartphone. Anti-spam laws arrived well-after the spam filters had already been created. For cryptocurrencies to reach their full potential most rapidly, a permissive regulatory regime is advisable to allow the market itself to develop solutions to some of the technology's most pernicious elements. It would be an irrevocable mistake to wave a red flag in front of the next potential Google GOOGL, -2.92% or Facebook FB, -1.90% .\n\nAtulya Sarin is a professor of finance at Santa Clara University.

Yahoo Inc. shares rose 0.6% Wednesday in a declining market, shrugging off the latest salvo against the company from activist investor Starboard Value LP.\n\nStarboard delivered a strongly worded letter to the company earlier, urging it to accept that major changes are needed, including a shake-up of management, a redrawing of its board, and an overhaul of strategy and execution.\n\nDespite over three years of effort and billions spent on acquisitions, the management team that was hired to turn around the core business has failed to produce acceptable results, in turn, causing massive declines in profitability and cash flow, Starboard wrote in the letter.\n\nRead also:Selling Yahoo's core business would be complicated\n\nYahoo US:YHOO responded by saying it's in the midst of a multiyear transformation and will share additional plans for change on or before its fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nWe attract more than a billion people every month and we've built a profitable, billion dollar business in mobile, video, native and social that we expect will drive sustainable growth, the company said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe company appeared to admit it needs help in December after years of financial struggles, when it said it is evaluating a spinoff of its core business into a separate publicly traded company.\n\nStarboard has long sought changes at the Internet company and on Wednesday it said investors have lost all confidence in the management team and the board. Most of Yahoo's current value stems from its investment in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, +1.72% over 10 years ago, and the good fortune that Alibaba's management team has executed well such that this investment today is worth over $30 billion, it said.\n\nRead also: Yahoo on road to Crazytown with latest spinoff idea\n\nYahoo's current market cap is about $30.5 billion, which Starboard said is either a massive tax liability, or reflects the fact that the company's core business is worthless, or a combination of the two.\n\nWe are confident that a separation of these assets can be accomplished through either a sale of the core business or a spinoff of the core business, said the letter.\n\nStarboard is convinced there are interested and credible buyers for Yahoo's core business, but said media reports suggest management has declined to engage with interested parties.\n\nThis is unacceptable, the letter asserted. It went on to threaten a proxy fight, in which it would urge shareholders to elect a board that would truly represent their interests and come up with a viable turnaround plan.\n\nYahoo said it is in regular communication with shareholders and strives to deliver value to them.\n\nYahoo shares have fallen 34% in the past 12 months, while the S&P 500 index has eked out a small gain. Analysts have speculated that a number of third-party buyers might be eager to take a look at the company, including a major media company. Such a deal would be comparable with Verizon Communications Inc.'s takeover of AOL, and would give a buyer a stake in Yahoo's ad technology, mobile research capabilities, digital content, such as video, and treasure trove of patents.\n\nA Verizon executive said in early December that the company would take a look at Yahoo's Web properties if they hit the market.\n\nThe letter adds to the pressure on Chief Executive Marissa Mayer, the company's fourth CEO in four years. Mayer has come under fire in recent months from a wide range of critics for failing to deliver on a promised turnaround plan.
Shares of Caterpillar Inc. CAT, -1.26% rallied 1.4% in morning trade Monday toward a record high, enough to pace the Dow Jones Industrial Average's DJIA, -0.46% gainers, after the mining and construction equipment maker was upgraded at J.P. Morgan. The stock's price gain of $2.25 added about 15.5 points to the price of the Dow, which was down 38 points. J.P. Morgan analyst Ann Duignan raised her rating to overweight from neutral and boosted her stock price target to $200 from $144, which ties her for the highest target among the 25 analysts surveyed by FactSet. Although the stock already soared 70% in 2017, the second-best calendar-year performance in the stock's history, according to FactSet, Duignan said she believes there is still significant upside to the stock. She said among the notable catalysts for the stock, the recent tax reform legislation should extend the cycle for Caterpillar's North America construction business and a lower tax rate supports higher through-cycle FCF. In addition, Duignan believes Caterpillar's resource business in si the second year of a 10-year upcycle.
Treasury prices rose on Tuesday, driving yields lower, after President-elect Donald Trump dismissed House Republicans' border tax plan as too complicated.\n\nTrump's comments, which appeared in The Wall Street Journal, suggested that the incoming administration could clash with congressional Republicans over the finer points of its broad-strokes policy proposals, possibly delaying—or derailing—their implementation, market strategists said.\n\nThe biggest issue [for the Treasury market] is going to be when Trump comes in what policies will we get and how quickly will we get them in place, said Larry Milstein, managing director of government and agency trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.711% shed 5.2 basis points to 2.327%, while the two-year yield TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.157% declined 3.7 basis points to 1.135%. The yield on the 30-year bond TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.455% fell 4.6 basis points to 2.930%. Tuesday's decline was the second largest of the year.\n\nOutside of the U.S., British Prime Minister Theresa May said Tuesday that the U.K. wants a clean break from the European Union, including leaving the so-called single market and customs union, which would allow the country to exercise tighter controls over its borders.\n\nThe market's reaction to May's remarks revived the notion that most of the strongest impulses affecting the Treasury market will be a consequence of other markets and even foreign geopolitical events, said Ian Lyngen and Aaron Kohli, fixed-income strategists at BMO Capital Markets, in a Tuesday research note.\n\nTreasury yields have steadily inched lower over the past four weeks, retracing part of a steep postelection climb triggered by Trump's unexpected electoral victory.\n\nInvestors pushed yields higher on the expectation that Trump's proposed policies—including stiffer trade barriers, a massive infrastructure bill and deregulation—would boost growth and wages, causing consumer-price inflation to rise more aggressively.\n\nTypically, when inflation is on the rise, bond investors demand higher yields to compensate for the corrosive affect that higher prices have on real returns.\n\nInvestors will soon turn their attention to a report on consumer-price inflation, due on Wednesday, remarks from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen, and Trump's Friday inauguration.\n\nFed. Gov. Lael Brainard said on Tuesday that the central bank might need to raise interest rates more swiftly if Trump's fiscal policies are too focused on stoking short-term demand. Yields remained lower after her comments.\n\nMeanwhile, government-bond yields held steady after the Empire State manufacturing index declined in January, retreating from an eight-month high.
Ford Motor Co. F, +1.60% said Monday it was ceasing production in Brazil, closing two plants immediately and another by the end of the year, winding down sales of some Brazil-made vehicles as inventory is sold. Manufacturing operations in Argentina and Uruguay and the sales companies in other South America markets are not affected, Ford said. The company said it will keep some customer-support, product-development, and related operations in Brazil as well as its regional headquarters in São Paulo. The auto maker said it will facilitate possible reasonable alternatives for interested parties to take over the available plants. In connection with this decision, Ford expects to pre-tax charges around $4.1 billion, including about $2.5 billion in 2020 and about $1.6 billion in 2021. Shares of Ford added to gains on the news, recently up 2.3%. The stock has lost 0.3% in the past 12 months, contrasting with gains around 17% for the S&P 500 index. SPX, +0.29%
Wall Street's 2018 pullback has left investors bruised, but market bulls contend that the recent pullback could wind up mimicking moves of about three years ago when a selloff that bottomed in early 2016 proved merely a pause before a series of all-time highs.\n\nIf you think what was plaguing the market at that time, you had a strong dollar that was choking off not only U.S. earnings but also the global economy. Oil was plunging…You had a Fed that was ending quantitative easing and they were projected to do four rate hikes in 2016, and then lastly you had very weak Chinese economic data, said Jeffrey Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments, which manages $148 billion.\n\nIt was a tough time for the stock market with the S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% posting the worst-ever start to a new calendar year. But by the end of the first quarter, the scene had changed. The Fed signaled a pause, which in turn weakened the dollar, and ended up delivering just one rate rise in 2016 at its December meeting. Oil found a bottom below $30 a barrel and Beijing delivered a final dose of stimulus that helped underpin Chinese, and global, growth, Schulze said, in an interview.\n\nBack then, stocks rebounded, ending the quarter in positive territory for the year, with the S&P 500 going on to post a 9.5% gain in 2016.\n\nBears contend there are important differences in the underlying fundamentals, but Schulze and other bulls have argued that history, while not repeating, could rhyme.\n\nCrude appears to have found a footing as output cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies take effect; Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell offered up some remarks in a public appearance on Friday that appeared to mollify bulls; the dollar is taking a pause after its 2018 rally; and China likely has further stimulus to deliver on top of the dozens of easing moves it implemented last year.\n\nSomething that wasn't in the mix in 2016 — tariffs and U.S.-China trade tensions — are likely to remain in the headlines as negotiations between Beijing and Washington continue, Schulze argued. That could serve to rattle investors, but he expects the fallout to remain manageable for the economy and most companies.\n\nBut perhaps most important, Schulze contends that as was the case about three years ago, the current market downturn is unlikely to be accompanied by a recession.\n\nClearBridge breaks big market selloffs into crashes and pullbacks. Crashes occur when stocks see a drawdown of 20% or more that lasts longer than a year. Pullbacks are selloffs of 15% or more that last less than a year. A look back at market performance shows crashes have been 2.5 times more likely to coincide with recessions.\n\nPut another way, that means five of the past six market crashes, as defined by the firm, have been tied to a recession, Schulze said. That means the key question for investors is whether the current market downturn will also be accompanied by a recession.\n\nClearBridge is confident the economy will avoid the R word, with Schulze citing the dashboard below in a note:\n\nClearBridge Investments\n\nWhile all three components (yield curve, credit spreads and money supply) of the financial markets section of the dashboard flipped to yellow from green in the fourth quarter, the consumer and business sections remain green, he noted.\n\nMeanwhile, price-to-earnings multiples have suffered amid the recent volatility, with strong earnings and a negative return combining to leave 2018 with the third biggest annual fall in P/Es over the past four decades, Schulze noted, exceeded only by 2000 and 2002. The fall left the P/Es, a popular measure of valuing stocks, near five-year lows. In particular, the pressure has been concentrated in cyclical sectors, which might be poised for the biggest positive surprises if growth holds up.\n\nThe valuation picture is similar to the situation in 1984 and 1994, when the S&P 500 saw subpar gains of 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively, amid a P/E contraction despite strong quarterly results and a solid economy. Schulze said stocks performed strongly the following years, with the S&P 500 logging a 26.3% gain in 1985 and a 34.1% return in 1995.\n\nBut market bears argue that the parallels, particularly between now and 2016, are superficial.\n\nCrucially, we think there are some key differences in the state of the U.S. and Chinese economies, which make a sustained recovery in the next few months unlikely, said Oliver Jones, economist at Capital Economics, in a Tuesday note.\n\nChina had seen credit growth, a strong leading indicator, begin to rebound in mid-2015, paving the way for a significant acceleration in activity beginning in early 2016, he said. At present, credit growth is showing no sign of finding a floor and is at its lowest in well over a decade, Jones said, which means a turnaround in the economy doesn't appear imminent.\n\nHe's no more optimistic about the U.S. economy's ability to repeat its 2016 pickup in growth. The Fed's rate-hike cycle was still in its infancy, with the Fed having just delivered its first increase of the cycle in December 2015. Now, the delayed effects of past rate increases are starting to bite, he said, while the sugar rush from last year's tax cuts and other fiscal stimulus are set to fade, leading Capital Economics to expect a clear slowdown for the U.S. economy in 2019.\n\nWith the world's two largest economies leading a slowdown in global growth, we suspect that the recent bounce in stock markets will fizzle out, with most around the world ending the year lower, he said.
A mob stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, but investors showed little reaction — lifting the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a record close and showing little appetite for traditional safe-haven assets despite violent scenes that temporarily interrupted the ratification of President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College victory.\n\nThat's because the invasion of the Capitol did nothing to change expectations around the near-term political and economic outlook.\n\nRead: Presidential election confirmation paused in Congress after protesters storm Capitol building in Washington\n\nInstead, the driving force behind the session's stock-market gains and other financial-market moves appeared to be optimism over the prospect for another, larger round of aid spending following a Democratic sweep of a pair of runoff elections in Georgia that will give the party control of the Senate as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office on Jan. 20. Democrats retained control of the House in the Nov. 3 elections.\n\nNo matter the political consequences of today's takeover of the Capitol, Wall Street continues to be encouraged by the economic-enhancement possibilities of a Democratic 'trifecta,' Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA, told MarketWatch in an email after Wednesday's market close.\n\nInvestors have also remained upbeat about the potential for vaccine rollouts to allow a wider economic reopening, despite snags in distribution and worries about a more rapid spread of COVID-19 as a result of new variants.\n\nSee: Democrats win Georgia's runoff elections, giving their party control of U.S. Senate\n\nStocks were in rally mode before the onset of the violence.\n\nWhile stocks did pare gains, they finished the session solidly higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.58% rose 437.80 points, or 1.4%, to close at a record 30,829.40 after earlier breaching the 31,000 threshold for the first time. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.29% advanced 0.6% to close at 3,748.14, just 0.2% away from its all-time high finish, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.40% lost ground to end the day with a loss of 0.6%.\n\nTreasurys, which tend to serve as a haven during periods of unrest and uncertainty, instead saw prices fall, driving up yields. The 10-year yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.660% rose 8.6 basis points to 1.041%, finishing above the 1% level for the first time in nine months.\n\nThe U.S. dollar, which also tends to find support during periods of chaos, was also largely unfazed. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.05% , a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was little changed near 89.41.\n\nIt was surprising, however, to see how little the market reacted overall, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.\n\nFinancial markets knew President Trump would not go away quietly, but they didn't expect this, Moya told MarketWatch in an email.\n\nCongress was set to resume the certification process, a key element in the peaceful transfer of power, on Wednesday evening.\n\nIn the end, the events at the Capitol will not change the election outcome and likely raise the importance that the Democrats were able to pull off the 'Blue Wave,' he said, referring to the sweep of the White House and both chambers of Congress.\n\nInvestors, meanwhile, see significant ramifications for U.S. policy and the economy as a result of a united government, said Kathy Lien, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, in a note.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden will be able to push through more aggressive stimulus packages and fund spending with higher taxes, Lien said, noting that Sen. Chuck Schumer, who will be majority leader, has deemed the passage of $2,000 stimulus checks to be a top priority for lawmakers.\n\nMeanwhile, investors are playing down worries over potential tax increases as they focus on prospects for immediate stimulus, she said.\n\nStovall, in a note earlier Wednesday, underlined the market-positive factors associated with a unified government, which he said belied the widely held belief that market participants prefer a divided government.\n\nHe noted that all eight Democratic presidents since 1900 have been accompanied by a Democratic-controlled House and Senate, and that the stock market posted above-average performances in the first year of such Democratic trifectas six out of eight times, for an average gain of 11.3%.
Shares of Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants Inc. DRI, -0.91% ran up 1.7% toward a record high in premarket trade Monday, after the company raised its fiscal 2018 adjusted profit outlook. The company, which restaurant brands also include LongHorn Steakhouse, Yard House and Bahama Breeze, said it now expects adjusted earnings per share of $4.70 to $4.78 up from its previous guidance of $4.45 to $4.53. Separately, said as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the company estimates it will record a non-cash benefit of $70 million, or 56 cents a share, related to the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities. The company said it plans to make a $20 million investment in its workforce in 2018. The stock has shot up 23% over the past three months through Friday, while the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% has gained 7.6%.
With the New Year here and a Democratic-controlled Senate looking increasingly likely after the runoff Senate elections in Georgia, President-elect Joe Biden's tax plans are unlikely to suffer from any lack of bipartisan support.\n\nAccording to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an independent, non-profit, bipartisan public-policy organization based in Washington, D.C. that examines federal budget and fiscal issues, Biden's tax plan would raise $3.35 trillion to $3.67 trillion over a decade if enacted in full starting next year, or 1.3% to 1.4% of gross domestic product.\n\nThe Biden tax plan is highly progressive, increasing taxes for the top 1% of earners by 13% to 18% of after-tax income, while indirectly increasing taxes for most other groups by 0.2% to 0.6%, the committee said, adding, The ultimate fiscal, economic, and distributional impact of President-elect Biden's tax policies will depend on how newly raised revenue is spent or allocated, it added.\n\nMajor proposals by the Biden campaign would raise $1.6 trillion to $1.9 trillion over a decade from corporations, $1 trillion to $1.2 trillion from high earners through the income tax, and $800 billion to $1 trillion from Social Security payroll taxes on high-wage earners. Biden also supports a fee on banks, which we believe will raise $100 billion, tax credits for renters and first-time homebuyers that we estimate will cost $300 billion, and an increase of the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, which we estimate will cost $100 billion.\n\nWhile on the campaign trail, Biden told ABC News: I will raise taxes for anybody making over $400,000. The very wealthy should pay a fair share. Corporations should pay a fair share. The fact is there are corporations making close to a trillion dollars that pay no tax at all.\n\nHe told the network that his administration would not raise taxes on 90% of the businesses out there are mom and pop businesses that employ less than 50 people. He said the coronavirus pandemic has taken a toll on these businesses. We have to provide them with the ability to reopen. We have to provide more help for them, not less help, he added.\n\nWith that in mind, it's time to consider moves that will lower your 2020 tax bill, and hopefully position you for tax savings in future years too.\n\nFederal tax outlook for 2021-2022\n\nGame the standard deduction\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) almost doubled the standard deduction amounts. For 2020, the basic standard deduction allowances are:\n\n* $12,400 if you are single or use married filing separate status.\n\n* $24,800 if you and your spouse file jointly.\n\n* $18,650 if you are a head of household.\n\n* Slightly higher standard deductions are allowed to those who are 65 or older or blind.\n\nHere's the plan. If your total itemizable deductions for 2020 will be close to your standard deduction amount, consider making enough additional expenditures for itemized deduction items before year-end to exceed the standard deduction. Those prepayments will lower this year's tax bill. Next year, your standard deduction might be a bit bigger thanks to an inflation adjustment, and you can claim it then. Or it could be smaller, if major tax-increase legislation passes, which I think is unlikely.\n\n* The easiest deductible expense to prepay is included in the house payment due on January 1. Accelerating that payment into this year will give you 13 months' worth of itemized home mortgage interest deductions in 2020. Although the TCJA put new limits on these deductions, you're probably unaffected. But ask your tax adviser to be sure.\n\nNext up on the prepayment menu are state and local income and property taxes that are due early next year. Prepaying those bills before year-end can decrease your 2020 federal income tax bill, because your itemized deductions total will be that much higher. However, the TCJA decreased the maximum amount you can deduct for state and local taxes to $10,000 or $5,000 if you use married filing separate status. So, beware of that limitation.\n\nWarning: The state and local tax prepayment drill can be a bad idea if you will owe the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for this year. That's because write-offs for state and local income and property taxes are completely disallowed under the AMT rules. Therefore, prepaying those expenses may do little or no tax-saving good if you will be in the AMT zone. Thankfully, changes included in the TCJA took millions of taxpayers out of AMT danger, but not everybody. Ask your tax adviser if you're in the clear for this year or not.\n\n* Consider making bigger charitable donations this year and smaller donations next year to compensate (more about charitable donations later). That could cause your itemized deductions to exceed your standard deduction this year.\n\n* Finally, consider accelerating elective medical procedures, dental work, and expenditures for vision care. For 2020, you can deduct medical expenses to the extent they exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income (AGI), assuming you itemize. Next year, the deduction threshold is scheduled to rise to 10% of AGI, but I doubt Congress will allow that to happen.\n\nSee also: 6 tax moves to consider before the end of the year — from Roth IRA conversions to prepaying college tuition\n\nCarefully manage gains and losses in taxable investment accounts\n\nIf you hold investments in taxable brokerage firm accounts, consider the tax advantage of selling appreciated securities that have been held for over 12 months. The federal income tax rate on long-term capital gains recognized in 2020 is only 15% for most folks, although it can reach the maximum 20% rate at high income levels. The add-on 3.8% net investment income tax (NIIT) can also bite at high income levels. So, the true maximum rate for high-income individuals is 23.8%: the advertised 20% top rate plus 3.8% for the unadvertised NIIT.\n\nTo the extent you have capital losses this year or capital loss carryovers from earlier years, selling winners by year-end will not result in any tax hit. In particular, sheltering net short-term capital gains with capital losses is a tax-smart move because net short-terms gains will otherwise be taxed at your higher ordinary income rate of up to 37%, plus another 3.8% if the NIIT bites. Ouch.\n\nWhat if you have some loser investments that you would like to unload? Biting the bullet and taking the resulting capital losses this year would shelter capital gains, including high-taxed short-term gains, from other sales this year.\n\nIf selling some losers would cause your 2020 capital losses to exceed your 2020 capital gains, the result would be a net capital loss for the year. No problem. That net capital loss can be used to shelter up to $3,000 of 2020 income from salaries, bonuses, self-employment income, interest income, royalties, and whatever else ($1,500 if you use married filing separate status). Any excess net capital loss is carried forward to next year and beyond.\n\nIn fact, having a capital loss carryover could turn out to be a pretty good deal. The carryover can be used to shelter both short-term gains and long-term gains recognized next year and beyond. This can give you extra investing flexibility in those years, because you won't have to hold appreciated securities for over a year to get a lower tax rate. You'll pay 0% to the extent you can shelter gains with your loss carryover. If there are future tax rate increases (which I think are unlikely through at least 2022), capital loss carryovers into future years could turn out to be really valuable.\n\nPresident-elect Biden's major tax proposals\n\n1. Higher maximum rate\n\nThe pre-election Biden tax plan would raise the top individual federal income rate on ordinary income and net short-term capital gains back to 39.6%, the top rate that was in effect before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) lowered it to 37% for 2018-2025. Biden also said he would generally raise taxes on folks with incomes above $400,000 without supplying specifics.\n\n2. Itemized deductions\n\nBiden has said he would limit the tax benefit of itemized deductions to 28% for upper-income individuals. In other words, each dollar of allowable itemized deductions could not lower your federal income tax bill by more than 28 cents, even if you are in the proposed 39.6% maximum tax bracket.\n\nFor upper-income individuals, Biden would reinstate the pre-TCJA rule that reduces total allowable itemized deductions above the applicable income threshold. Allowable deductions are reduced by 3 cents for every dollar of income above the threshold.\n\nBiden would eliminate the TCJA's $10,000 cap on itemized deductions for state and local taxes.\n\n3. Higher maximum rate on long-term capital gains\n\nUpper-income individuals would face higher capital gains taxes under the Biden plan. Under current law, the maximum effective federal income tax rate on net long-term capital gains and qualified dividends recognized by individual taxpayers is 23.8%, as explained in the main body of this column. Under the Biden plan, net long-term gains (and presumably dividends) collected by those with incomes above $1 million would be taxed at the same 39.6% maximum rate that is proposed for ordinary income and net short-term capital gains. With the 3.8% NIIT add-on, the maximum effective rate on net long-term gains would 43.4% (39.6% plus 3.8%). That would be almost double the current maximum effective rate of only 23.8%.\n\n4. Higher Social Security taxes for upper-income individuals\n\nUnder current law, the 12.4% Social Security tax hits the first $137,700 of 2020 wages or net self-employment income. Employees pay 6.2% via withholding from paychecks, and employers pay the remaining 6.2%. Self-employed individuals pay the entire 12.4% out of their own pockets via the self-employment (SE) tax. For 2020, the 12.4% Social Security tax cuts out once 2020 wages or net SE income exceed the $137,700 ceiling. For 2021 and beyond, the Social Security tax ceiling will be adjusted annually to account for inflation. As things currently stand, the 2021 ceiling will rise to $142,800.\n\nThe Biden tax plan would restart the 12.4% Social Security tax on wages and net SE income above $400,000. This is the so-called donut hole approach to increasing the Social Security tax. Over the years, the donut hole would gradually close as the lower edge of the hole is adjusted upward for inflation while the $400,000 upper edge of the hole remains static.\n\n5. Elimination of basis step-up for inherited assets\n\nUnder current law, the federal income tax basis of an inherited capital-gain asset is stepped up fair market value as of the decedent's date of death. So, if heirs sell inherited capital-gain assets, they only owe federal capital gains tax on the post-death appreciation, if any. This provision can be a huge tax-saver for greatly-appreciated inherited assets — such as personal residences that were acquired many years ago for next to nothing and are now worth millions. The Biden plan would eliminate this tax-saving provision.\n\n6. Elimination of real-estate tax breaks\n\nThe Biden tax plan would: (1) eliminate the $25,000 exemption from the passive loss rules for rental real estate losses incurred by middle-income individuals, (2) eliminate Section 1031 like-kind exchanges that allow deferral of capital gains taxes on swaps of appreciated real property, (3) eliminate rules that allow faster depreciation write-offs for certain real property, and (4) eliminate qualified business income (QBI) deductions for profitable rental real estate activities.\n\n7. Increased child- and dependent-care credits\n\nUnder current law, parents can collect a credit of up to $2,000 for each under-age-13 qualifying child. This is a refundable credit, which means you don't have to have any federal income tax liability to collect the credit. In other words, the child credit is free money.\n\nUnder current law, another credit of up to $2,100 is allowed to cover expenses to care for a qualifying dependent, including an eligible child, or up to $4,200 for expenses to care for two or more qualifying dependents. In most cases, however, an income limitation reduces the maximum allowable credit to $1,200 or $2,400 for two or more qualifying dependents.\n\nThe Biden tax plan would increase the maximum refundable child credit to $4,000 for one qualifying child or $8,000 for two or more qualifying children. Families making between $125,000 and $400,000 would receive reduced credits. Apparently, the same rules would apply to an enhanced credit for expenses to care for qualifying dependents.\n\nBiden would also establish a new credit of up to $5,000 for informal caregivers.\n\n8. New credits for homebuyers and renters\n\nThe Biden plan would create a new refundable tax credit of up to $15,000 for eligible first-time homebuyers. The credit could be collected when a home is purchased, rather than later at tax-return filing time. Biden would also establish a new refundable tax credit for low-income renters. The credit would be intended to hold rent and utility payments to 30% of monthly income.\n\n9. 'Green energy' tax changes\n\nBiden would reinstate or expand tax incentives intended to reduce carbon emissions — such as deductions for emission-reducing investments in residential and commercial buildings and restored credits for buying electric vehicles produced by manufacturers whose credits have been phased-out under current law. Biden would also eliminate federal income tax deductions for oil and gas drilling costs and depletion.\n\n10. And finally…\n\nOne of the biggest changes in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was the installation of a flat 21% corporate federal income tax rate for 2018 and beyond. Before the TCJA, the maximum effective rate for profitable corporations was 35%. The Biden plan would increase the corporate tax rate to 28%. This change would raise an estimated $1.1 trillion or so over 10 years.\n\nThe Biden plan would impose a new 15% minimum tax on corporations with at least $100 million in annual income that pay little or no federal income tax under the regular rules. An affected corporation would pay the greater of: (1) the regular federal income tax bill or (2) 15% of reported book net income. This new tax would raise an estimated $160 billion to $320 billion over 10 years.
All main stock benchmarks closed at records on Tuesday with the S&P 500 notching six consecutive records to kick off a new year, something it has not done since 1964. Confidence over the economy on top of optimism over tax cuts have continued to whet investors' appetite for stocks. Expectations of another strong quarter of corporate earnings are also helping to support demand for equities. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% rose 106 points, or 0.4%, to 25,389. The S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% added 3 points, or 0.1%, to end at 2,751 while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% gained 6 points to 7,163.
Electric-car sales jumped to a record 54% of all new-vehicle sales in Norway last year, but Tesla's Model 3 lost its place as the country's bestselling vehicle despite a late surge.\n\nIt is the first time a country has recorded more sales of electric cars than those powered by petrol, diesel and hybrid engines over an entire year.\n\nThe Norwegian government plans to ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2025, and has used incentives and tax breaks in recent years to encourage an electric-car boom.\n\nBattery-electric vehicles (BEVs) made up 54.3% of new passenger-car sales in 2020, up from 42% in 2019, according to figures published by the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) on Tuesday.\n\nDecember was a bumper month for car sales in the Nordic country — the best on record — as more than 20,000 new vehicles were registered. Of these, 66.7% were electric vehicles and 4,232 were Tesla Model 3s — more than 20% of all vehicle sales in the month.\n\nRead: Tesla gets big boost over plans for first European factory\n\nHowever, Tesla's TSLA, +3.68% popular midsize model — the bestselling car in Norway in 2019 — fell to second place in 2020, losing out to Volkswagen's VOW, +15.83% Audi e-tron with Volkswagen's ID.3 in third.\n\nFollowing a record year for Tesla in Norway in 2019, the U.S. company faced stiffer competition in 2020 as its rivals launched a number of electric cars, while the COVID-19 pandemic also affected sales.\n\nDecember saw something of a comeback, with Tesla selling 4,232 cars — 54% of its annual 7,770 total. The company is also set to launch its Model Y electric SUV in Norway later this year, Reuters reported.
The dollar gave up earlier advances and lost ground against euro and the yen on Friday, with the greenback slumping for a third consecutive week.\n\nThe ICE Dollar Index DXY, +0.43% , a gauge of the dollar against six rivals, declined 0.2% to 101.18, and is down 1% over the week. The WSJ Dollar Index BUXX, +0.02% , a measure of the U.S. dollar against a bigger basket of major currencies, fell 0.2% to 91.86, and lost 1% over the week.\n\nThe dollar perked up briefly in early New York trade after positive economic data, which pointed to continued growth in the economy, but gains were short-lived.\n\nU.S. retails sales rose by 0.6% in December driven by record auto sales. Even though the headline number was slightly below economists' forecasts, it was still fairly strong, according to Neil Mellor, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon.\n\nSeparately, wholesale inflation rose in December. Higher rates of inflation will allow the Federal Reserve to continue with the normalization of interest rates.\n\nThe Fed is expected to raise rates three times this year, according to so-called 'dot plot', a projection of Fed members' forecasts for interest rates released last month.\n\nThe dollar had rallied since last summer on prospects of higher inflation and higher interest rates as well as potential accelerated economic growth, if the new administration of President-elect Trump delivers on promised fiscal stimulus.\n\nMellor said that small daily moves in currency markets should be taken in the context of a sharp rally in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a corrective downward trend over the past few weeks, as little fresh information on Trump's economic policies emerged from his news conference on Wednesday.\n\nThere was hope for more information on fiscal plans from President-elect Donald Trump, but he did not provide any. So, the dollar declined a bit and can drift sideways until after the inauguration and possibly much after that, Mellor said. The U.S. presidential inauguration is set for Jan. 20.\n\nAgainst its Japanese counterpart, the U.S. currency USDJPY, +0.08% was trading at ¥114.51 late Friday in New York compared with ¥114.85 late Thursday in New York. Over the week, the dollar weakened 2.1% against the yen.\n\nGreenback retreated broadly against major European currencies.\n\nThe euro EURUSD, -0.01% strengthened to trade at $1.0645 late Friday in New York from $1.0614 on Thursday and gained 1.1% against the dollar over the week.\n\nThe British pound GBPUSD, -0.04% gained ground against the dollar trading at $1.2189 late Friday in New York, up from $1.2151 on Thursday. Over the week, however, the sterling gave up 1.3% against the greenback, trading near lowest levels since October.\n\nDespite recent weakness, Mellor thinks that the dollar will end 2017 stronger.\n\nThe outlook for the dollar has not changed. Most currencies will lose ground against the dollar in 2017, because the Federal Reserve is doing what other central banks are not—raising interest rates, said Mellor.\n\nRead: Here's why the U.S. dollar could soar by another 30%

The U.S. dollar carved out a three-month low, deepening its losses during Wednesday's trading session after the Federal Reserve's December meeting minutes showed a dovish tilt in the central bank.\n\nWhile multiple comments from officials, as well as a lowered expectations of rate increases in 2019 from three to two already pointed to a change of sentiment at the Fed, the minutes hammered that point home on Wednesday. Some central bank officials had been in favor of pausing the rate increases in December already, and many agreed that the Fed could be patient with their hikes going forward.
Is buying a house instead of renting really the best financial decision?\n\nIt's a question that's frequently debated, with traditional thinking being that renting is akin to throwing money out the window. But there are some good reasons to believe that buying a home instead of renting isn't as great of an investment as Americans once thought.\n\nHousing is overrated as a financial investment, according to economist Alex Tabarrok, an economics professor at George Mason University and a research fellow at the university's Mercatus Center, which conducts research on financial markets. He addressed the question of what economists think about buying compared to renting on Marginal Revolution, a blog he runs with fellow economist and George Mason professor Tyler Cowen.\n\nFirst, it's not good to have a significant share of your wealth locked into a single asset, he wrote. Diversification is better and it's easier to diversify with stocks. Second, unless you are renting the basement, houses don't pay dividends. Stocks do. You can hope that your house will accumulate in value but don't count on it. Indeed, you should expect that as an investment your house will appreciate less than does the stock market.\n\nOwning a home makes it harder for many people to change locations for new job opportunities, leading to homeowners holding onto homes even while prices fall, Tabarrok said.\n\nStill, Americans don't seem to be giving up on homeownership yet. Sales of existing homes rose 14.7% in December, the biggest monthly increase ever recorded, after depressed sales in November. Sales in 2015 were the best since 2006, at 5.26 million.\n\nSuper Bowl 50: Budweiser Helen Mirren Ad\n\nAmericans are also buying homes that are larger and pricier; average home size was 2,720 square feet in 2015, up from 2,660 square feet in 2014. And the average price of new homes for sale in 2015 was $351,000, up from $100,000 in 2009. (Still, this doesn't necessarily reflect the housing market's strength, as new construction has mostly happened in the high-end market.)\n\nOf course, there are some benefits to homeownership, and they aren't just avoiding unexpected rent hikes and unpredictable landlords. Many people simply enjoy interior decorating and entertaining, Tabarrok added. And perhaps more importantly, home ownership is often tied to access to better public schools. The U.S. tax code also subsidizes houses.\n\nStill, he cautioned against the seduction of a large home. Behavioral economics tells us that we quickly get used to big houses, but we never get used to commuting, he wrote. So when you have a choice, go for the smaller house closer to work.
Gold prices finished Tuesday trade sharply higher, with uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Senate runoff elections in Georgia offering support for the haven metal.\n\nA climb in the U.S. ISM manufacturing index to its highest since August 2018, in data published Tuesday, relieved fears about the economic recovery from the pandemic, and along with strength in the domestic stock market, produced some headwinds for gold earlier in the session.\n\nHowever, gold found support from uncertainty about Tuesday's runoff elections in Georgia more than anywhere else, Jeff Wright, executive vice president of GoldMining Inc., told MarketWatch.\n\nIf Democrats win both seats in the Georgia runoff contests, that could make it easier for President-elect Joe Biden's administration to pass legislation that could influence trading in stocks, including the repeal of corporate tax cuts put in place under the Trump administration.\n\nThe fear is Democrats could control both houses of Congress, and push through radical tax policy, run away spending, and alter any semblance of divided government, Wright wrote.\n\nRead: Why you may have to wait past Tuesday for the Georgia election results\n\nThe result of the Senate runoff elections in Georgia will have massive implications for the country over the coming years, wrote Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, in a daily research note.\n\nThe Republicans only need one seat to retain their majority with a double Democrat victory giving them a de facto majority, given the casting vote of the vice President [Kamala Harris], he said.\n\nIn Tuesday dealings, gold for February delivery GCG1 GC00, +1.31% rose $7.80, or 0.4%, to settle at $1,954.40 an ounce, following a 2.7% gain on Monday that took bullion to its highest level since early November, according to FactSet data.\n\nSilver futures for March delivery SIH1 SI00, meanwhile, rose 27.6 cents, or 1%, to settle at $27.640, following a 3.6% gain for gold's sister metal to start 2021.\n\nWright said he's looking for gold to return to $2,000 in the coming weeks after the Biden administration takes over. \n\nMeanwhile, renewed implementation of lockdown measures in the U.K, EU and U.S. in particular to limit the spread of the coronavirus caused some consternation on Wall Street and, perhaps, bolstered appetite for bullion.\n\nSee: January will be worst month for U.S. pandemic so far with postholiday travel cases seen surging\n\nThe highly transmissible strain of COVID-19 recently discovered in the U.K. has also been found in New York, the state's governor said Monday, and London announced a stricter national lockdown, even as vaccines are being rolled out in many parts of the world.\n\nBut U.S. data released Tuesday morning revealed that the ISM manufacturing index climbed to 60.7% in December, from 57.5%, to reach its highest level since August 2018, dulling appetite for gold and prompting some losses in earlier dealings. U.S. benchmark stock indexes also traded broadly higher, a day after their first losses to open a new year since 2016.\n\nA soft start for U.S. dollar, after its steepest annual slide since 2017, also was helping to buttress gold and silver prices. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.05% was off 0.5% on Tuesday at around 89.466, hanging around its lowest level since the spring of 2018. A weaker dollar can make gold more attractive to overseas buyers.\n\nRounding out metals action on Comex, March copper HGH21, -0.22% tacked on 8.5 cents, or 2.4%, to end at $3.6395 a pound.
The very stable genius calling the shots in the White House loves dangling the freight-training stock market in front of America as an affirmation of his bigly productive first year. And investors, if the latest reading from the AAII survey is any indication, are betting the enormously consensual president will keep driving those record gains. Or at least not get in the way.\n\nAs you can see from our chart of the day,via Dana Lyons of J. Lyons Fund Management, individual investors haven't been this heavy into equities since back in 2000, during the fragile peak of the dot-com bubble.\n\nThe December reading shows stock allocation jumped from 69% to 72%, which trails the 77% level reached before the epic implosion nearly two decades ago. The 3-percentage-point jump is the biggest monthly increase in four years. Does that mean a collapse is imminent? Of course not. Maybe.\n\nIn the near-term, the stock market will do whatever it wants, Lyons writes in a blog [ost. That includes the possibility of rallying for several more years, despite the present elevated reading.\n\nHe notes that stocks managed to rally for years following the 72% reading registered in 1997. Lyons, however, isn't exactly feeling bullish about a repeat of that.\n\nThis reading implies a significant level of potential longer-term risk, he says. If the market does start to head meaningfully lower, this condition could exacerbate the decline, given the amount of capital with the potential to exit the market. In such an event, the substantial potential risk could, thus, become manifested risk.\n\nRead more:Bullish sentiment for U.S. stocks is at a seven-year high\n\nKey market gauges\n\nIt's a flat morning so far in U.S. markets, with the Dow DJIA, -0.46% and S&P SPX, -1.48% slightly lower as the Nasdaq COMP, -3.02% sneaks into positive territory.

Well, 2018 is a completely different story so far, with GE and its 6% surge beating all other blue chips.\n\nOf course, it's only been a few days, but that's enough to trigger a potential breakout, according to The Street's Jonas Elmerraji, who uses this chart to paint a bullish picture for the coming months.\n\nAfter lagging the rest of the Dow in a big way for the last year, this is a mean-reversion trade, Elmerraji writes. Now, just to be clear, higher ground for the last four or five sessions alone isn't a signal that GE's last year of selling is over. Instead, that turnaround is being signaled by where those recent sessions have left shares.\n\nSpecifically, he says GE is now trading around its 50-day moving average, and a move above that means a change in trend that could deliver the goods.

People on Social Security need a tax break. The rest of us need to make sure they get it — for everyone's sake.\n\nWhen Congress made Social Security benefits taxable in 1983, lawmakers didn't index the tax thresholds to inflation. They forgot inflation again when adding a second layer of taxation in 1993.\n\nThat means the proportion of recipients who have to pay federal income taxes on their benefits keeps increasing. Initially, only 1 in 10 Social Security recipients had to pay any federal tax. Now, it's over half.\n\nNot indexing to inflation is a sneaky way of boosting taxes. Lawmakers can count on growing federal revenue without the politically uncomfortable act of repeatedly voting for those increases.\n\nThe taxes are based on combined income, which is a taxpayer's adjusted gross income, plus any tax-exempt interest (such as interest on mutual bonds) and half of her Social Security benefit. Based on that:\n\nSingle people with combined income over $25,000 a year, or couples with over $32,000 a year, face taxes on up to 50% of Social Security benefits.\n\nSingle retirees earning over $34,000 and couples earning over $44,000 may pay taxes on up to 85% of benefits.\n\nBecause of the way Social Security benefits are taxed, many middle-income retirees face a tax torpedo, where their marginal tax rate can more than double. (If you'll have retirement savings of roughly $200,000 or more, consider talking to a tax professional or financial planner about how and when to claim Social Security benefits to minimize the tax effects.)\n\nRead:Why people who claim Social Security early often live to regret it\n\nIn many cases, we're punishing people who saved for retirement. That isn't fair, and it isn't smart.\n\nSo we should demand Congress index Social Security taxation to inflation, right? Based on the 1983 threshold numbers, that would ensure that only singles making over about $64,000 year, and couples making over $82,000 a year, would have to pay taxes on their Social Security income.\n\nIf only it were that simple.\n\nThe money collected from these taxes goes to two specific places: the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. Perhaps you're starting to see the problem.\n\nBoth trust funds are running short of cash and could be depleted in a few years. That doesn't mean they'll be bankrupt. It does mean they won't be able to pay 100% of promised benefits.\n\nSocial Security's retirement trust fund is expected to run dry in 2034, after which it would be able to pay only 75% of the benefits that have been promised. Yanking away what amounts to 4% of its revenue, which is what's generated by taxing up to 50% of benefits, would just hasten that day.\n\nSee: When should I claim Social Security?\n\nMedicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is in worse shape. The fund, which pays for inpatient hospital visits, skilled nursing, home health care and hospice, is forecast to be depleted in 2026, just a few years from now. The money raised from taxing Social Security benefits makes up 8% of the revenue going into the fund.\n\nSo fixing the stealth tax will require fixing Social Security and Medicare as well.\n\nProposals to privatize or scrap these systems face strong political opposition. Plus, the proponents can't guarantee that future generations would be better off. Shoring up the current systems, by contrast, would ensure that today's workers get the benefits they've been promised.\n\nThat almost certainly means those of us who are still working will pay in one way or another. We could fix the problem virtually overnight by raising the Social Security tax rate by 1.415% to 7.615% and increasing the Medicare tax rate by 0.32% to 1.77%. (Employers would pay an equal amount, since payroll taxes are split between workers and employers.)\n\nMore likely, tax increases would be phased in over time and combined with other changes, such as raising the full retirement age and lifting or eliminating the current cap on how much of our earnings are taxed. (The current 6.2% Social Security tax applies only to the first $128,700 of annual earnings in 2018, while the 1.45% Medicare tax applies to all earnings.) You can experiment with possible solutions using the American Academy of Actuaries' Social Security Game.\n\nFew of us are excited about paying more taxes, but shoving the burden onto retired people who've already paid their dues simply isn't right. Making the system more fair could benefit all of us, now and in the future.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:
Tesla Inc. stock rallied to an all-time high Thursday, boosted by one upgrade and hopes that a blue Senate will be a potential game changer for the Silicon Valley electric-car maker and other EV and alternative-energy companies.\n\nTesla TSLA, +3.68% shares traded as high as $816.99, an intraday record, and extended their winning streak to a 10th session, their longest since a 10-day stretch in April.\n\nThe rally pushed Tesla's valuation to $773.5 billion, surpassing Facebook Inc.'s FB, +1.69% $765.5 billion valuation, thus making Tesla the fifth largest U.S. company by market cap. Tesla has added nearly $105 billion in market value this week.\n\nAnalysts at RBC Capital, led by Joseph Spak, raised their rating on Tesla stock to their equivalent of hold, from sell, and set a price target of $700, from a previous $339.\n\nSee also: Tesla and other EV makers report record sales, sending stocks to new highs\n\nThere is no graceful way to put this other than to say we got (Tesla's) stock completely wrong (even if our fundamental view to date wasn't too far off), they said in a note Thursday. But in the spirit of New Year's resolutions and in light of our recent EV forecast through 2050 report , we re-evaluate (Tesla's) place in the industry, growth opportunity and inexpensive access to capital.\n\nOf the 37 analysts surveyed by FactSet, 12 rate Tesla stock a buy, 14 rate it a hold, and 11 rate it a sell, with an average price target of $455.71, implying a downside of more than 40%.\n\nOur biggest miss was how (Tesla) can take advantage of its stock price to raise capital inexpensively and fund capacity outlays and growth, the RBC analysts said. Traditional auto makers need to generate significant cash from existing operations to fund their transition to electrification, and Tesla can also use its stock price to fund acquisitions, they said.\n\nEven a relatively large deal would be insignificant to (Tesla's) market cap … To sum it up, the higher stock price is somewhat self-fulfilling to (Tesla's) growth potential, the analysts said.\n\nThe boost for Tesla shares came amid steep gains for shares of other EV-and EV-related companies and alternative-energy stocks in recent sessions, as investors bet that a Democrat-controlled Senate will prioritize clean-energy policies.\n\nRelated: GM sales drop for the year, but bounced back to pre-pandemic levels in Q4\n\nThe iShares Global Clean Energy ETF ICLN has gained nearly 20% this week and 190% in the last 12 months.

In comparison, the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.29% has gained 1.3% this week and about 18% in the last 12 months.\n\nA Blue Senate is very bullish and a potential 'game changer' for Tesla and the overall EV sector, with a more green-driven agenda now certainly in the cards for the next few years, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note Thursday.\n\nWe believe a doubling down on EV tax credits and further consumer incentives and government initiatives around the EV sector will be on the horizon which is a major positive for Tesla as well as General Motors Co. GM, +5.13% , privately held Rivian , Fisker Inc. FSR, +2.03% , and other EV-related companies, he said.\n\nTesla was added to the S&P 500 index Dec. 21. The stock fell in that session and the next, but has been on an upward trajectory ever since. The stock has gained more than 750% in the past 12 months, compared with gains around 18% for the S&P.
The Congressional Budget Office raised its estimate of the budget deficit for fiscal 2016 to $544 billion from $414 billion. The nonpartisan CBO said the bigger estimate was mostly due to the retroactive extension of several corporate and individual tax provisions. As a percentage of gross domestic product the deficit would be 2.9%, versus the previously estimated 2.2%. The government's budget year runs from October through September.
With a Trump presidency rapidly bearing down on Wall Street, market participants are scrambling to get in position for at least the next four years. David Einhorn is prepared for a few scenarios including the possibility of a recession.\n\nIn a letter to clients dated Jan. 17, Einhorn, the founder of Greenlight Capital, offered up a few insights into his thinking as Donald Trump is set to be sworn in as the U.S.'s 45th president on Friday.
Medicare health insurance premiums can add up to big bucks, especially if you're married and both you and your spouse are paying. In this column, I'll list the 2018 and 2019 premium amounts and explain when you can potentially claim tax deductions for them. Here goes.\n\nMedicare Part A coverage is commonly called Medicare hospital insurance. It covers inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing facility care, and some home health care services. You don't have to pay premiums for Part A coverage if you paid Medicare taxes for 40 or more quarters during your working years. In that case, you're considered to have paid your Part A premiums via Medicare taxes on wages and/or self-employment income. However, some individuals did not pay Medicare taxes for enough months while working and must pay for Part A coverage.\n\n* If you paid Medicare taxes for 30-39 quarters during your working years, the 2018 Part A premium was $237 per month ($2,844 for the full year). For 2019, the monthly premium is $240 ($2,880 for the full year).\n\n* If you paid Medicare taxes for less than 30 quarters, the 2018 Part A premium was $422 per month ($5,064 for the full year). For 2019, the monthly premium is $437 ($5,244 for the full year).\n\n* The same premiums apply to your spouse if he or she paid Medicare taxes for less than 40 quarters while working.\n\nMedicare Part B Premiums\n\nMedicare Part B coverage is commonly called Medicare medical insurance or Original Medicare. Part B mainly covers doctors and outpatient services, and Medicare-eligible individuals must pay monthly premiums for this benefit.\n\nThe monthly premium for the current year depends on your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), as reported on your Form 1040 for two years earlier. Strange but true. For example, your 2019 premiums depend on your 2017 MAGI. MAGI means the adjusted gross income (AGI) amount shown on page 1 of your Form 1040 plus any tax-exempt interest income.\n\nFor 2018, most people paid the base Part B premium of $134 per month ($1,608 if premiums were paid for the full year).\n\nFor 2019, the base premium is $135.60 per month ($1,627 for the full year).\n\nHigher-income individuals must pay a surcharge for Part B coverage on top of the base premium. See the section below.\n\nMedicare Part D Premiums\n\nMedicare Part D coverage is for private prescription drug coverage. Premiums vary depending on the plan. Higher-income individuals must pay a surcharge on top of the base premium. See the section near the bottom of this article.\n\nMedigap Supplemental Coverage Premiums\n\nMedicare Parts A and B do not pay for all health care expenses. Coverage gaps include copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles. So you may want to buy a so-called Medigap policy, which is private supplemental insurance that's intended to cover some or all of the gaps. In most states, insurance companies can only sell standardized Medigap policies that offer the same basic benefits. Some Medigap policies offer additional benefits for an additional cost. Premiums vary depending on the plan you select.\n\nMedicare Advantage (Medicare Part C) Premiums\n\nYou can get your Medicare benefits from the government through Part A and Part B coverage or through a so-called Medicare Advantage plan offered by a private insurance company. Medicare Advantage plans are sometimes called Medicare Part C.\n\nThe government pays the Medicare Advantage insurance company to cover your Medicare Part A and Part B benefits. Medicare Advantage plans may also include prescription drug coverage (Medicare Part D), and they may also provide dental and vision care benefits that are not covered by Medicare Part B.\n\nWhen you enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, you continue to pay Medicare Part B premiums. You will usually pay a separate additional monthly premium for the Medicare Advantage plan, but some plans do not charge any additional premium. The additional premium, if any, depends on the plan you select.\n\nKey Point: Medigap policies do not work with Medicare Advantage plans. So if you join a Medicare Advantage plan, you should drop your Medigap coverage.\n\nTax deductions for Medicare health insurance premiums\n\nPremiums for all of the aforementioned Medicare health insurance coverages can be combined with your other qualifying health care expenses for purposes of claiming an itemized deduction for medical expenses on your Form 1040. However for 2018, you can only claim an itemized medical expense deduction to the extent your total qualifying expenses exceed 7.5% of AGI. For 2019, the medical expense deduction threshold is scheduled to rise to a daunting 10% of AGI unless Congress extends the 7.5%-of-AGI deal.\n\nAnother factor: Because the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act greatly increased the standard deduction amounts for 2018-2025, fewer individuals will be itemizing. But having significant medical expenses (including those for Medicare health insurance premiums) may allow you to itemize and collect some tax savings.\n\nFor 2018, the standard deduction amounts are $12,000 for single filers, $24,000 for married joint-filing couples, and $18,000 for heads of households. For 2019, the standard deduction amounts are $12,200, $24,400, and $18,350, respectively.\n\nKey Point: If you are self-employed or an S corporation shareholder-employee, you can claim an above-the-line deduction for your health insurance premiums — including Medicare premiums. And you don't need to itemize to get the tax-savings.\n\nMedicare Premium Surchages for Higher-Income Folks\n\n2018 Part B Surcharges\n\nHigher-income individuals must pay a surcharge in addition to the base premium for Part B coverage. For 2018, surcharges apply to singles with 2016 MAGI in excess of $85,000 and married joint-filing couples with 2016 MAGI in excess of $170,000. Including the surcharges (which go up as 2016 MAGI goes up), the 2018 Part B monthly premium for each covered person can be $187.50 ($2,250 for the full year), $267.90 ($3,215 for the full year), $348.30 ($4,180 for the full year), or $428.60 ($5,143 for the full year). The maximum $428.60 premium applies to singles with 2016 MAGI in excess of $160,000 and married individuals who filed 2016 joint returns with MAGI in excess of $320,000.\n\n2019 Part B Surcharges\n\nFor 2019, the Part B surcharge depends on the MAGI amount from your 2017 Form 1040. Also, another MAGI category has been added to the surcharge structure for 2019. Surcharges apply to singles with 2017 MAGI in excess of $85,000 and married individuals who filed joint 2017 returns with MAGI in excess of $170,000. Including the surcharges (which go up as 2017 MAGI goes up), the 2019 Part B monthly premiums for each covered person can be $189.60 ($2,275 for the full year), $270.90 ($3,251 for the full year), $352.20 ($4,226 for the full year), $433.40 ($5,201 for the full year), or $460.50 ($5,526 for the full year) The maximum $460.50 premium applies to singles with 2017 MAGI in excess of $500,000 and married individuals who filed 2017 joint returns with MAGI in excess of $750,000.\n\n2018 Part D Surcharges\n\nFor 2018 the Part D surcharge depends on your 2016 MAGI and the surcharge goes up using the same MAGI scale as the aforementioned Part B premium surcharge. The monthly surcharge amounts for each covered person can be $13.00, $33.60, $54.20, or $74.80. The maximum $74.80 surcharge applies to singles with 2016 MAGI in excess of $160,000 and married individuals who filed 2016 joint returns with MAGI in excess of $320,000.\n\n2019 Part D Surcharges\n\nFor 2019 the Part D surcharges depend on your 2017 MAGI and they go up using the same MAGI scale as the Part B surcharges. The good news is the 2019 surcharges are slightly lower than for 2018, except for folks in the highest MAGI category. The 2019 monthly surcharge amounts for each covered person can be $12.40, $31.90, $51.40, $70.90, or $77.40. The maximum $77.40 surcharge applies to singles with 2017 MAGI in excess of $500,000 and married individuals who filed 2017 joint returns with MAGI in excess of $750,000.
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc. CBRL, +0.55% shares were up 5.4% in Tuesday afternoon trading after the stock was upgraded to buy from neutral at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, which raised its price target to $151 from $149. Analysts increased their fiscal 2016 and 2017 earnings estimates to $7.66 and $8.50, respectively, based on boosts from falling egg prices and renewal of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which will lower the company's tax rate. SunTrust also raised its fiscal second quarter (ended January) 2016 same-store sales growth estimate to 1.5% from 0.3% based on the continued drop in gas prices, year-over-year comparisons that benefit from recent favorable weather conditions and same-store sales growth in Nov. and Dec. 2015. Analysts also believe there's potential for a share repurchase program or special dividend. Cracker Barrel shares are down 9.5% for the past three months versus the S&P 500, which is down 8.3%.
Beijing (Caixin Online) — China started levying hefty anti-dumping and anti-subsidy tariffs on Thursday on U.S. corn products used as animal feed — the latest development in a slew of trade disputes between the world's two largest economies.\n\nPunitive tariffs on U.S.-made dried distillers grains with or without soluables (DDGS) have been raised to 42.2% to 53.7%, up from the original de facto 33.8% tax that the ministry imposed in September, the Ministry of Commerce said Wednesday. The government held proceeds from the taxes as a deposit until the final ruling.\n\nThe ministry announced its final ruling in an investigation that had been prompted by complaints from local suppliers in November 2015.\n\nChinese companies had said corn subsidies in the U.S. were indirectly benefiting U.S. suppliers of DDGS, allowing them to flood the Chinese market. DDGS is a corn-based byproduct from the ethanol industry used by animal breeders as a substitute for corn and soymeal.\n\nChinese buyers now must pay anti-subsidy duties of 11.2% to 12.0%, up from the 10.7% required by the ministry since September. Both duties are slapped on top of after-tax prices and will be collected for five years, the ministry said.\n\nThe case is expected to worsen already frayed Sino-U.S. trade relations, which have been threatened by the protectionist rhetoric of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who will assume office next week.\n\nRead:Trump's game of chicken with China is a lose-lose situation\n\nSee:Here are 10 World Bank charts on the uncertain global trade environment\n\nAlmost all DDGS that China imports comes from the U.S. The country bought 6.8 million tons of the feed ingredient worth $2 billion from the U.S. in 2015, up from $1.8 billion for 5.4 million tons in the previous year, Chinese customs data showed.\n\nChina accounted for nearly half of U.S. exports of the product from October 2014 to September 2015, but the figure dropped to about one-fourth last year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a report in December.\n\nThe ministry investigation found that the market share of DDGS supplied by American producers, traders and their Chinese partners targeted in the probes rose from 41.6% at the beginning of 2012 to 70.2% in the first nine months of 2015, the ministry said in a separate statement. That hurt local companies, who were forced to reduce prices despite rising costs.\n\nHere's what Trump means for the tech industry\n\nThe ruling came after Washington last month requested that the World Trade Organization intervene over Beijing's management of a tariff quota for some crop imports that allegedly cost American farmers billions of dollars in potential exports.\n\nSee:U.S. expected to slap WTO complaint against China over aluminum subsidies\n\nDays before that, China lodged a suit with the WTO accusing the United States and the European Union of failing to comply with the international trade body's rules to stop using surrogate pricing to calculate anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nTrump's election win has added further uncertainties to bilateral trade relations as he promised during his campaign to name China a currency manipulator in his first day of office and threatened to slap a 45% tariff on imports from the country.\n\nSee this report at Caixin Online.

Danny Kofke, a 41-year-old middle-school teacher outside of Atlanta, often looks at a picture of a family trip to Disney World from a few years ago — to him, it exemplifies what he's working toward in his retirement: more trips and long-lasting happy memories.\n\nHe and his wife, Tracy, a former schoolteacher and now a technology coach, started saving when they were first married in 2000, putting away money every month and increasing their savings as they received raises. They recently had to adjust their contributions to pay off the last of their debt, and plan to be debt-free this fall, but they're making it up with sound and stringent financial decisions.\n\nHaving an eye on the bigger prize helps us say no to things daily, he said. This includes having a car he can't charge his iPhone in because it came out before the iPhone was introduced — a small price to pay for not having a car payment in 13 years.\n\nThe 40s decade is a critical time for retirement savings, as it is likely when a person will reach their peak income and can make a dent in their long-term goals if they haven't yet begun to do so. For a 40-year-old with nothing saved for retirement, putting away $650 a month (about 15% of a $50,000 salary) can get them $1 million in retirement savings by age 67, according to calculations on personal finance personality Dave Ramsey's website. (That's not too far off from the amount in savings for the median working-age couple, which is $5,000, according to a 2013 Federal Reserve survey of consumer finances).\n\nWhat to do in your 40s to retire a millionaire\n\nSee:Get a grip on your debt and 4 other ways to boost your retirement confidence\n\nMaximizing earnings should be a main focus in your 40s, experts said. This includes negotiating salaries, asking for raises or finding additional income. If a salary isn't enough to support your lifestyle and retirement savings, there are two additional options: the first, create or look over your budget and see what can be cut — the second, consider a side hustle, said Jill Cornfield, who writes about retirement for personal finance site Bankrate.com. You can start with a hobby, or build a mini business and eventually make that side gig a full-time job if you'd like. Regardless, saving as much as you can is important. I have never heard someone who said 'I wish I hadn't saved so much.'\n\nRead:\n\n• This is how your finances should look in your 20s\n\n• This is how your finances should look in your 30s\n\n• This is how your finances should look in your 50s\n\n• This is how your finances should look in your 60s\n\nNow is also the time to begin using various types of accounts for retirement funds, said Patrick Amey, a financial adviser at advisory firm KHC Wealth Management Services in Overland Park, Kan. Max out employer-sponsored retirement accounts, such as a 401(k) or 403(b) plan, and use Roth Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). The third option is a taxable investment account, that they can use in the early years of their retirement as their tax-deferred accounts (the first two types) continue to grow. Cornfield said a good estimate is stashing away 8% to 12% of your salary, whereas Amey said anywhere from 10% to 15%.\n\nSticking to a plan is also key to having a comfortable amount of assets when it's time to retire, something Joe Mecca, a 40-year-old marketing manager at Coastal Federal Credit Union in Raleigh, N.C. has done, he said. Even when finances were tight — such as student loans, auto loans and at one point his dual-income household becoming a single-income household — he remained steadfast on contributing to his future's funds, knowing the money would grow to his benefit. He did admit it would have been easier to stop contributions so he could have more cash flow every paycheck, though.\n\nI had to have faith in the system, he said. Even as I was going through different life changes I have always trusted the plan.\n\nWondering what your savings should look like during a major money milestone?

Business leaders called for a peaceful transition of power after President Donald Trump's supporters stormed into the Capitol building on Wednesday, with at least one group calling for the invocation of the 25th Amendment to remove the president.\n\nSome blamed Trump directly for the deadly violence in the nation's capital, which forced members of Congress who were attempting to certify the presidential election results to barricade themselves inside the Capitol. At least one woman was shot in the chaos; she has since died, according to NBC News, which cited law enforcement sources.\n\nArmed violent protestors who support the baseless claim by outgoing President Trump that he somehow won an election that he overwhelmingly lost have stormed the U.S. Capitol today, attacking police officers and first responders, because Trump refused to accept defeat in a free and fair election, National Association of Manufacturers President and Chief Executive Jay Timmons said in a statement.\n\nTimmons — who has previously voiced support for Trump's policies, including corporate tax cuts and a trade battle with China — even suggested that Vice President Mike Pence should consider using Constitutional powers to evict Trump from office.\n\nVice President Pence, who was evacuated from the Capitol, should seriously consider working with the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to preserve democracy, Timmons added.\n\nThursday, amid growing calls for Trump's removal, ice cream maker Ben & Jerry's released a statement in which it called Wednesday's siege a riot to uphold white supremacy. The brand owned by Unilever UL, -0.64% added, Resign, impeach, 25th Amendment… not one more day.\n\nThe Business Roundtable, which is currently chaired by Walmart Inc. WMT, -0.83% Chief Executive Doug McMillon, said in a statement Wednesday: The chaos unfolding in the nation's capital is the result of unlawful efforts to overturn the legitimate results of a democratic election.

Cook and some other members released statements of their own.\n\nToday marks a sad and shameful chapter in our nation's history, Cook tweeted Wednesday night. Those responsible for this insurrection should be held to account, and we must complete the transition to President-elect Biden's administration.

An example of an industry that has been deeply affected by the pandemic is travel.\n\nWorking American families depend on a productive government to facilitate their livelihoods — especially in this time of unprecedented crisis and challenge — and the willful disruption of our democratic transition is an unacceptable act of harm that is felt not just in Washington, but in every corner of the country, the U.S. Travel Association said in a statement.\n\nTrump took to social media Wednesday with a minute-long video in which he called the election fraudulent and stolen and urged the mob to go home, but not before he told them, We love you.

As a new Congress starts work this month, voters are eager for lawmakers to address student debt.\n\nThat's one finding of a poll of more than 1,000 adults released Monday by Politico and Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Among educational issues, respondents said they're most eager for Congress to find ways to lower student debt.\n\nRoughly 87% of Democrats and 61% of Republicans said it would be extremely important for Congress to find ways to decrease student debt.\n\n Roughly 87% of Democrats and 61% of Republicans said it would be extremely important for Congress to find ways to decrease student debt. \n\nWith 44 million Americans contending with $1.5 trillion in student debt, it's no wonder families are anxious. For some, a student-loan bill may be just one on top of many making it more difficult to save for a house, retirement or a career switch.\n\nThe poll results indicate that politics may soon catch up to the reality borrowers are facing, said Mark Huelsman, the associate director of policy and research at Demos, a left-leaning think tank.\n\nIt's a sign of the increasing anxiety that voters and families are feeling about their own debt or their children going into to debt or them going into debt for their children, he said.\n\nAs the 2020 campaign for president (and other offices) heats up, addressing student debt may provide an opportunity for both Democrats and Republicans to lure voters who may feel more of a sense of urgency surrounding their student loan bill than addressing college costs for their future children, Huelsman added.\n\n 'It's a sign of the increasing anxiety that voters and families are feeling about their own debt or their children going into to debt or them going into debt for their children.'  — —Mark Huelsman, the associate director of policy and research at Demos\n\nFor others, the consequences of student debt can be even more dire, including lost wages, tax refunds and government benefits. More broadly, student loans can exacerbate inequality by making it difficult for low-income borrowers and people of color to move up the economic ladder.\n\nAs college costs have jumped over the past few decades, student debt has gone from a relatively niche and manageable personal finance issue to a common American experience. And politicians, particularly a younger crop of lawmakers who have personal experience with student debt, are starting to notice.\n\nAlmost all of the Democratic candidates in the 2016 presidential election included some provision that would make tuition at public colleges free or debt-free. During the 2018 midterm campaign, more candidates — most prominently Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York City — began talking openly about some form of debt forgiveness, an issue that didn't feature prominently in the mainstream 2016 campaign.\n\nOcasio-Cortez even identified student-debt cancellation as one of many issues progressive public servants might discuss on social media to gain traction with voters and followers.\n\nEconomists also appear to be taking the idea of student-debt cancellation more seriously, which could provide some intellectual backing to candidates interested in campaigning on the issue. A study released last year by the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College in Annandale-On-Hudson, N.Y. found that wiping out the nation's student debt could have a positive impact on the economy.\n\nAddressing student debt is probably more analogous to addressing housing affordability or addressing health care or addressing anything that is impacting a family's bottom line, Huelsman said.
If you've been getting more spam calls this month, the government shutdown could be to blame.\n\nSystems meant to thwart robocalls and other spam phone calls are down due to the government shutdown. This includes the Federal Trade Commission's do not call registry and the online complaint system run by the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nThe FCC and the FTC, two government agencies, told MarketWatch they are unable to respond to request for comment due to the government shutdown.\n\nThe lapse comes as the robocall epidemic rages on in the U.S., with nearly 4.7 billion robocalls made in the month of December, equivalent to 150.9 million robocalls per day, according to data from YouMail, a robocall blocking service for mobile phones. This is a decline of 8% from the record number of 5.11 billion robocalls made in October, but experts say the number could increase once again due to the shutdown.\n\n 'With robocallers, it is a game of whack-a-mole. The bad actors constantly change their methods as detection systems improve.'  — —Jim Tyrrell, senior director of product marketing at robocall solutions provider Transaction Network Services, Inc.\n\nWith robocallers, it is a game of whack-a-mole, said Jim Tyrrell, senior director of product marketing at robocall solutions provider Transaction Network Services, Inc. (TNS). The bad actors constantly change their methods as detection systems improve.\n\nThe do not call registry is a database run by the Federal Trade Commission where consumers can put their phone numbers to signify they do not want telemarketers to call them. The website is completely non-functional due to the government shutdown. The link goes to a blank holding page that says, due to the government shutdown, we are unable to offer this website service at this time. It says it will resume normal operations when the government is funded.\n\nTyrrell said it is likely telemarketers can access existing numbers, but anyone who wants to add a new phone number cannot. This will have a larger effect on legitimate telemarketers than robocalls exclusively for scams, he said.\n\nBad actors are not going to look at the 'do not call' list before they try to scam people out of their money, he said. But there will be a higher number of telemarketing calls, what we call 'nuisance calls,' from legitimate businesses.\n\nIf your number is on the do not call registry and a telemarketer calls you anyway, you can report them to the Federal Communications Commission. However, that complaint line is shut down due to the lack of government funding. What's more, the file your complaint button on the FCC website leads to a page featuring a notice on the lapse in funding and its effects on Commission operations.\n\n Telemarketers make up about 17% of overall robocalls, according to data from YouMail, while scams make up 40%. \n\nTelemarketers make up about 17% of overall robocalls, according to data from YouMail, while scams make up 40%. Tyrrell said the shutdown is particularly concerning given the number of fake Internal Revenue Service scams that generally arise as tax season approaches. Someone who is scammed by a robocall posing as the IRS will have trouble contacting the legitimate agency to clear it up, he said.\n\nThere is going to be a backlog of complaints when the government finally does return from the shutdown, Tyrrell predicted.\n\nThe IRS will only call people on rare occasions. According to the IRS, There are special circumstances in which the IRS will call or come to a home or business, such as when a taxpayer has an overdue tax bill, to secure a delinquent tax return or a delinquent employment tax payment, or to tour a business as part of an audit or during criminal investigations.\n\nIt does not call to demand immediate payment using a prepaid debit card, gift card or wire transfer, nor does it threaten to bring in local police or immigration officers. The IRS also cannot revoke your driver's license, business licenses, or immigration status. Threats like these are common tactics scam artists use to trick victims into buying into their schemes, according to the IRS.
Sirius XM Holdings Inc. SIRI, +1.28% ticked lower in the extended session Tuesday after the satellite radio company issued forecasts for this year and the next. Sirius shares declined 0.9% after hours, following a 2.1% gain to close at $6.35 a share Tuesday. The company said it expects to meet or exceed its 2018 guidance for revenue, free cash flow, and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. In late October, Sirius forecast self-pay net subscriber additions of about 1.28 million for the year, revenue of about $5.73 billion, adjusted EBITDA of about $2.2 billion, and free cash flow of about $1.5 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet estimate self-pay net subscriber additions of 1.32 million, revenue of $5.75 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $2.17 billion, and free cash flow of $1.53 billion. For 2019, Sirius XM said it expects self-pay net additions approaching 1 million, revenue of about $6.1 billion, adjusted EBITDA of about $2.3 billion, and free cash flow of about $1.6 billion. Analysts expect self-pay net additions of 1.1 million, revenue of $6.07 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $2.35 billion, and free cash flow of $1.69 billion. The company said its guidance does not include the effect of its expected acquisition of Pandora Media Inc. p in the first quarter. Sirius is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Jan. 30.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's plan to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use in the Empire State is a milestone in the push toward full legalization of the substance in the U.S., experts said Wednesday.\n\nCuomo said Tuesday in his State of the State speech that he's including in his budget for the current fiscal year a plan to make cannabis legal for adults over the age of 21. The governor is aiming to create a legal industry that would include minority- and women-owned businesses and create jobs in some of the more economically deprived parts of the state. Ten states have so far legalized cannabis for recreational use, while another 33 have legalized medical cannabis.\n\nLegalize adult-use cannabis, he said. Stop the disproportionate impact on communities of color. And let's create an industry that empowers the poor communities that paid the price and not the rich corporations who come in to make a profit.\n\nSmoke Wallin, president of California-based cannabis company Vertical Cos., said the move is a significant step forward in the mainstreaming of the industry.\n\nAlthough the fourth most populous state, after California, New York represents the most influential market for consumers and the steady march toward national normalization, he said. We expect the continued state by state liberalization of cannabis use to continue to put pressure on the federal government.\n\nRead now:Marijuana IPOs in 2019: These companies could be the next hot pot stocks\n\nRob DiPisa, co-chair of the Cannabis Law Group at law firm Cole Schotz, agreed, noting New York's influential role in many industries, from fashion to business to entertainment. This will change everything, DiPisa said. Once New York enters the market, we'll see bright young people come in and challenge the industry.\n\nCuomo is expecting to generate about $300 million in annual tax revenue from the new business, although he will include an option for counties to opt out of legal sales, if they choose. Funds raised would be used to finance a state traffic-safety committee, for small-business development, and for substance-abuse services and other programs.\n\nThe governor is proposing to impose a 20% state tax and 2% county tax on transfers of cannabis from wholesalers to retailers, along with a $1-per-gram tax on dry flower for growers and a 25-cents-per-gram tax on trim.\n\nThat may put a steep burden on companies operating at the wholesale level, said DiPisa, while Cuomo's intention to include unionized labor in the new industry is a worthy goal that may add still further costs.\n\nHaving seen what we have on the West Coast, when these markets come on line, there is typically high demand at the start, followed by oversaturation that can result in way more cannabis than is needed — and so the price falls, he said.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, for example, the wholesale price of a pound of cannabis in West Coast states that have legalized recreational cannabis was above $2,000. The comparable price fell below $400 last summer in Oregon, thanks to oversupply, putting pressure on growers.\n\nDon't miss:A guide to pot stocks: What you need to know to invest in cannabis companies\n\nPlus:For complete MarketWatch coverage of the cannabis industry, click here\n\nThe other challenges include that cannabis companies need to be well-capitalized but are unable to access capital in the form of capital markets or bank loans. Cannabis is still illegal at the federal level, where it is classified as a Schedule I drug, putting it in the same class as heroin and cocaine. As long as the federal prohibition is in place, companies can't have bank accounts at federally insured institutions, and they can't sell product across state lines.\n\nSee now:Want to be the only 'POT' stock in Canada? There's a lottery for that\n\nThat's the Achilles' heel in this business; normally, if you have a surplus or price plummets, you just ship it to another state, but here you don't have that option, said DiPisa.\n\nVertical's Wallin said that Cuomo's revenue projection is conservative and that he would expect revenue from a city as densely populated as New York to be closer to $1 billion, upon full rollout.\n\nIn case you missed it:The collapse of this cannabis stock offers a valuable lesson to every investor\n\n\n\nGiven that the much smaller state of Colorado is generating several hundred million [dollars] annually, it seems reasonable, he said. (Colorado's population is 5.6 million, while New York's statewide population is more than three times that; New York City's population alone exceeds 8.5 million.)\n\nThe ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF MJ, -4.88% was up 0.5% on Wednesday and has gained 22% so far in 2019, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% has gained about 5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.39% has added about 4%.\n\nRead now:The weed middleman that expects to make billions as the Sunkist of pot
Nearly two years on, the verdict is in on Philadelphia's soda tax.\n\nAnd it isn't good.\n\nPhiladelphia's soda tax, implemented in 2017, comes to 1.5 cents per ounce, equal to a hefty $1 tax on a typical $1.56, two-liter bottle. The city included artificially sweetened diet sodas in the tax, while excluding sugary fruit juices. The city government admitted the tax was about raising revenues, not just making people healthier.\n\nThe tax, justified as a kind of sin tax in the national war on obesity, did next to nothing for people's health, new research has shown. Philadelphians didn't cut calories as a result of the tax on sweetened drinks, nor did they shift towards drinking anything healthier.\n\nInstead, most of them just drove outside the city to buy the same old sodas from stores where they didn't have to pay the tax.\n\nMeanwhile the poorest in the city — those who would find it hardest to drive for many miles to buy soda — just ended up paying more in taxes.\n\nWe find no significant reduction in calorie and sugar intake, conclude researchers Stephan Seiler from Stanford University, Anna Tuchman from Northwestern and Song Yao from the University of Minnesota, in a study published this week.\n\n 'The tax does not lead to a shift in consumption towards healthier products, it affects low income households more severely, and it is limited in its ability to raise revenue.' \n\nThe tax does not lead to a shift in consumption towards healthier products, it affects low income households more severely, and it is limited in its ability to raise revenue, they wrote.\n\nAs the obesity epidemic effects the poor disproportionately, they say, the tax imposes a relatively larger financial burden on low income/high obesity households that are less likely to engage in cross-shopping at stores outside of the city.\n\nThey also note that this dismal outcome is wildly at odds with earlier, optimistic economic forecasts about how such soda taxes would fare. A variety of economists, using spreadsheets and theoretical economic models, predicted that taxing sugared drinks would lead to sharp falls in the amount of them that are drunk, especially by the poor.\n\n A variety of economists, using spreadsheets and theoretical economic models, predicted that taxing sugared drinks would lead to sharp falls in the amount of them that are drunk. \n\nAnthony Campisi, a spokesperson for the Ax the Philly Bev Tax Coalition, called it a wildly unpopular beverage tax.\n\nIt is now up to our elected officials to listen to the concerns of their constituents and provide Philadelphians much-needed relief by reversing this tax, Campisi said, according to Philly.com.\n\nResearchers studied sales data for 900 sugared and sweetened drink products in and around Philadelphia over nearly four years, from January 2015 through September 2018, covering a period before the tax was implemented and afterwards. They used detailed retail scanner data on prices and quantities from eleven retail chains in the area, covering 357 different stores.\n\nThe result? There was a massive, 42% plunge in the sales of affected drinks within Philadelphia. Sales fell most in the wealthiest neighborhoods.\n\nBut there was no corresponding jump in the sales of untaxed drinks. They actually went down too, though only by a few percentage points. Instead, there was simply a huge jump in the sales of sugared and sweetened drinks in stores just outside the city.\n\nCompared to the decrease of 51,000 ounces of taxed beverages at the average store in Philadelphia, we find an even larger increase of 61,000 ounces (per store) in stores up to 2 miles away from the city, the researchers found.\n\n On other hand, researchers found that even higher income shoppers were reluctant to drive more than about six miles routinely to save money on sodas. \n\nStores up to 4 and 6 miles outside of Philadelphia experienced smaller increases in sales. The biggest boost of all, they found, was in the stores less than a mile from the city limits. And this boost has persisted, they added.\n\nApparently, none of this was accurately forecast using economic models.\n\nOn other hand, researchers found that even higher income shoppers were reluctant to drive more than about six miles routinely to save money on sodas. So taxes applied more broadly — at a state or even national level — would be harder to avoid.\n\nWhether these end up combating bad health, or just raising more tax revenues at the expense of the poor, is another matter.
NEW HAVEN, Conn. (Project Syndicate) — Speculative markets have always been vulnerable to illusion. But seeing the folly in markets provides no clear advantage in forecasting outcomes, because changes in the force of the illusion are difficult to predict.\n\nIn the United States, two illusions have been important recently in financial markets. One is the carefully nurtured perception that President-elect Donald Trump is a business genius who can apply his deal-making skills to make America great again.\n\nThe other is a naturally occurring illusion: the proximity of Dow 20,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% has been above 19,000 since November, and countless news stories have focused on its flirtation with the 20,000 barrier, which might be crossed by the time this commentary is published. Whatever happens, Dow 20,000 will still have a psychological impact on markets.\n\nTrump has never been clear and consistent about what he will do as president. Tax cuts are clearly on his agenda, and the stimulus could lead to higher asset prices. Lower corporate taxes are naturally supposed to lead to higher share prices, while cuts in personal income tax might lead to higher home prices (though possibly offset by other changes in the tax system).\n\n The Dow is up only 19% in real (inflation-adjusted) terms since 2000. A 19% increase in 17 years is underwhelming. \n\nBut it is not just Trump's proposed tax changes that plausibly affect market psychology. The U.S. has never had a president like him. Not only is he an actor, like Ronald Reagan; he is also a motivational writer and speaker, a brand name in real estate, and a tough deal maker. If he ever reveals his financial information, or if his family is able to use his influence as president to improve its bottom line, he might even prove to be successful in business.\n\nThe closest we can come to Trump among former U.S. presidents might be Calvin Coolidge, an extremely pro-business tax cutter. The chief business of the American people is business, Coolidge famously declared, while his treasury secretary, Andrew Mellon — one of America's wealthiest men — advocated tax cuts for the rich, which would trickle down in benefits to the less fortunate.\n\nThe U.S. economy during the Coolidge administration was very successful, but the boom ended badly in 1929, just after Coolidge stepped down, with the stock market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression. During the 1930s, the 1920s were looked upon wistfully, but also as a time of fakery and cheating.\n\nOf course, history is never destiny, and Coolidge is only one observation — hardly a solid basis for a forecast. Moreover, unlike Trump, both Coolidge and Mellon were level-headed and temperate in their manner.\n\nBut add to the Trump effect all the attention paid to Dow 20,000, and we have the makings of a powerful illusion. On Nov. 10, 2016, two days after Donald J. Trump was elected, the Dow Jones average hit a new record high, and has since set 16 more daily records, all trumpeted by news media.\n\nThat sounds like important news for Trump. In fact, the Dow had already hit nine record highs before the election, when Hillary Clinton was projected to win. In nominal terms, the Dow is up 70% from its peak in January 2000. On Nov. 29, 2016, it was announced that the S&P/CoreLogic/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index (which I co-founded with my late colleague Karl E. Case) reached a record high the previous September. The previous record was set more than ten years earlier, in July 2006.\n\nWill augmented reality or virtual reality win?\n\nBut these numbers are illusory. The U.S. has a national policy of overall inflation. The U.S. Federal Reserve has set an inflation objective of 2% in terms of the personal consumption expenditure deflator. This means that all prices should tend to go up by about 2% per year, or 22% per decade.\n\nThe Dow is up only 19% in real (inflation-adjusted) terms since 2000. A 19% increase in 17 years is underwhelming, and the national home price index that Case and I created is still 16% below its 2006 peak in real terms. But hardly anyone focuses on these inflation-corrected numbers.\n\nThe Fed, like the world's other central banks, is steadily debasing the currency, in order to create inflation. A Google Ngrams search of books shows that use of the term inflation targeting began growing exponentially in the early 1990s, when the target was typically far below actual inflation. The idea that we actually want moderate positive inflation — price stability, not zero inflation — appears to have started to take shape in policy circles around the time of the 1990-1991 recession. Lawrence Summers argued that the public has an irrational resistance to the declining nominal wages that some would have to suffer in a zero-inflation regime.\n\nMany people appear not to understand that inflation is a change in the units of measurement. Unfortunately, although the 2% inflation target is largely a feel-good policy, people tend to draw too much inspiration from it. Irving Fisher called this fixation on nominal price growth the money illusion in an eponymous 1928 book.\n\nThat doesn't mean that we set new speculative-market records every day. Stock-price movements tend to approximate what economists call random walks, with prices reflecting small daily shocks that are about equally likely to be positive or negative. And random walks tend to go through long periods when they are well below their previous peak; the chance of setting a record soon is negligible, given how far prices would have to rise. But once they do reach a new record high, prices are far more likely to set additional records – probably not on consecutive days, but within a short interval.\n\nIn the U.S., the combination of Trump and a succession of new asset-price records — call it Trump-squared — has been sustaining the illusion underpinning current market optimism. For those who are not too stressed from having taken extreme positions in the markets, it will be interesting (if not profitable) to observe how the illusion morphs into a new perception, one that implies very different levels for speculative markets.\n\nRobert J.

U.S. Treasury yields barely budged Tuesday, with action in U.S. government bonds pausing a day ahead of a news conference by President-elect Donald Trump, which could offer specifics about his plan for the U.S. economy.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.711% rose 0.2 basis point to 2.379%, while the yield on the 30-year bond TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.455% finished unchanged at 2.971%. Meanwhile, the two-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.157% , rose 0.4 basis point to 1.172%. Bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices.\n\nTreasury yields have been mostly climbing since Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8, a victory that has stirred hope that campaign promises touting fiscal stimulus, regulatory rollbacks and tax cuts, could be realized and rev up the domestic economy. That hope has pushed inflation expectations higher and ratcheted up forecasts for interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve.\n\nHigher inflation and anticipation of Fed hiking have underpinned selling in bonds, lifting yields from a low in July of 1.36% to a high last month of about 2.6%. A plot of projections for future rate hikes by Fed members released last month, implies three rate increases in 2017.\n\nCheck out: Goldman's Hatzius: Investors could get blindsided by a cluster of Fed hikes this year\n\nBut the main spark for Treasurys moves has been the coming presidential administration.\n\nRead:Gross says this key bond level is a far bigger deal than Dow 20,000\n\nIan Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, said any focus on fiscal stimulus would spur renewed reflation jitters,'' which would hurt the bond market. Reflation refers to the risk of higher inflation, which can erode the value of a bond's fixed-income payments.\n\nThe recent selloff in Treasurys, and the accompany rally in risk assets like stocks and crude oil, has moderated somewhat as Wall Street awaits further details on Trump's policy proposals and weigh its potential impact on the overall economy. Trump's inauguration is set for Jan. 20.\n\nThe first Treasury-note auction of 2017—a sale of $24 billion three-year notes—saw the strongest demand since August, with bids exceeding supply 2.97 times. The sale produced a yield of 1.472%, the highest for a three-year auction since 2010.\n\nThe stats are solid, but strong 3-year note auctions are really the norm as opposed to what we saw over the prior two months, said Thomas Simons, analyst at Jefferies, in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, the yield on the 10-year German bond TMBMKDE-10Y, -0.259% , known as the bund, was at 0.282% on Tuesday.\n\n—Min Zeng contributed to this article
Maine's Republican Gov. Paul LePage, over the holiday weekend, signed into law the proclamation that will effectively make marijuana possession and consumption legal in the state. Question 1, which voters passed Nov. 8, was a statewide initiative to regulate and tax marijuana. Starting Jan. 30 Maine residents who are 21 years of age and older will be free to possess 2.5 ounces of marijuana and grow six flowering plants, 12 immature plants and unlimited seedlings. Use in public is still illegal. We look forward to working with the legislature to ensure a timely implementation of Question 1, which will provide adults with a legal way to purchase marijuana from licensed and regulated businesses, said David Boyer, campaign manager on Yes on 1 in a statement.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is drawing attention Friday for suggesting that the wealthiest Americans ought to pay a tax rate of as high as 70% in order to fund a Green New Deal. See full story.\n\n3 unfortunate ways the government shutdown will impact you\n\nA partially closed government has the potential to affect nearly every facet of American lifestyles. See full story.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez notwithstanding, the big winners in the midterms were moderate Democrats. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other party leaders carefully salted swing districts with young candidates who appealed to minorities, college-educated women and suburbanites who want solutions to problems in their daily lives, not a socialist revolution.\n\nThe Great Blue wave of radical progressivism never materialized. Elizabeth Warren, who led a national effort to elect progressive candidates like Richard Cordray for governor in Ohio and Katie Porter for the House in California, largely flamed out.\n\nThe moderate Democrats who snatched Republican seats mostly ran on clean government and incremental improvements to health care — not mindless opposition to President Donald Trump or advocacy of socialized medicine.\n\nStill health-care costs have spun out of sight, because the Affordable Care Act enables drug companies, hospitals, large insurers and large-group practices of specialists to monopolize and impose outlandish prices in national and regional markets.\n\nJust as Democrats should give up on the idea of a single-payer system based on confiscatory taxes on upper-income Americans, Republicans must wake up to the hard reality that competition in many health-care markets is rigged.\n\nIn a divided Congress, oversight could cast a discerning focus on monopoly exploitation to coax a reluctant Justice Department to start prosecuting abusers. Together, the two parties need to fashion legislation that requires drug companies, hospitals, insurers and medical professionals to benchmark prices against those fetched in prosperous northern European countries with insurance-based payments systems.\n\nAn increasingly urban society requires better commuter-mass transit and intercity connections. Financing infrastructure runs smack into the exorbitant costs imposed by cumbersome regulations and costly delays imposed by federal, state and local agencies. Engaging Trump on regulatory reform and encouraging a special dialogue with governors about prohibitive delays could help.\n\nStill trillions more dollars are needed but the federal deficit is already too big and someone has to pay. Many members of Congress reflexively balk at higher gas taxes and user-fees solutions but Leaders Pelosi and Chuck Schumer could triangulate the issue with Trump.\n\nOn immigration, the movement toward a common-sense compromise to realign U.S. policy to place great emphasis on admitting immigrants with skills in short supply, a greater capacity to quickly assimilate and attributes less threatening to struggling rural communities has some bipartisan support, but little enthusiasm from the Democratic leadership.\n\nThe Supreme Court may soon permit Trump to end President Barack Obama's DACA program and that would force reluctant Democrats to the table on broader reforms. If they balk, those young people face deportation and neither party should count on exploiting that spectacle — incumbents of all stripes would catch voters' ire.\n\nOn trade and the broader economy, Democratic congressional leaders like to exploit Trump's missteps — for example, putting tariffs on imported components that force U.S. manufacturers to offshore even more and his targeting of our allies with tariffs.\n\nMany Democrats in Congress recognize China's criminal behavior is a menace to American prosperity and security. A steady, private dialogue that links their support for congressional approval of the new North American free trade deal to Trump trading in his spray gun for a more focused trade rifle would help broaden their party's appeal to working-class voters.\n\nTrump's economy is doing well and finally raising wages. Able-bodied adults on the sidelines are rejoining the workforce but to maintain an elevated pace of growth without running into crippling shortages of engineers, technicians and other skilled workers requires Democrats to support immigration reform and make the recent tax cuts permanent.\n\nThat will require the Democrats to shelve their tropism for higher taxes on upper-income Americans and for the president to give up on yet more budget-busting tax cuts. Alternatively, both sides could go after the carried interest tax break for Wall Street's financial engineers — those levy lower capital gains tax rates on income that should rightly be classified as wage income.\n\nAll this may disappoint the combative political instincts of Pelosi and Trump but winning long-term majorities—holding power by governing effectively—requires moving to where the American people really stand—in the pragmatic center.
U.S. Steel Corp. X, +8.12% shares fell in the extended session Tuesday after the steel producer missed Wall Street estimates for the quarter. U.S. Steel shares dropped 10% to $7. The company reported an fourth-quarter loss of $6.83 a share on revenue of $2.57 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast a loss of 88 cents a share on revenue of $2.53 billion. Of U.S. Steel's $999 million loss on the quarter, $606 million of that was the result of a tax provision, the company said.
As 2021's first week kicks off, funds from the second round of stimulus checks are starting to become available — but not necessarily for some H&R Block and TurboTax customers who are now venting online.\n\nCustomers for the two major tax-preparation companies took to Twitter. TWTR, +1.37% , often in salty language, a week after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Internal Revenue Service would begin the $600 check-distribution process.\n\nMnuchin said the direct-deposit distribution process started last Tuesday night and the IRS would start dropping checks in the mail one day later. For taxpayers, the payments are based off what they earned in their 2019 tax returns, which are the ones people filed in mid-July or mid-October if they got an extension. The IRS says it's using the banking information it already has on file from those returns.\n\nMonday, Jan. 4, marked the date when the funds first formally became available for use, the IRS said, even though some people may have seen the money as provisional or pending in their accounts before that.\n\nBut at a time when many people need a cash infusion, the money's not available, according to some angry social-media users.\n\nBoth TurboTax INTU, -0.94% and H&R Block HRB, +0.48% told MarketWatch they are doing everything they can to pass along stimulus money as soon as possible — and both emphasized it's up to the IRS when to send the money.\n\n(The payments are automatic, the IRS said Monday, and people should not contact their financial institutions or the IRS with payment timing questions.)\n\nOn Tuesday, the IRS said, Because of the speed at which the law required the IRS to issue the second round of Economic Impact Payments, some payments may have been sent to an account that may be closed or, is or no longer active, or unfamiliar.\n\nIt reiterated that financial institutions can't hold and issue payments to people when the account isn't active and the money has to be sent back. The IRS said it was it was working on a compressed timeline and didn't have time to reissue and mail checks.\n\nThe solution for people with stymied stimulus checks was filing their 2020 tax return as soon as possible once tax season started and claim the Recovery Rebate Credit for the stimulus check then.\n\nDon't miss: Is my stimulus check taxable income? Will it reduce my tax return? Burning questions about the second COVID-19 stimulus\n\nWe know how important these funds are for so many Americans and that everyone is anxious to get their money, a TurboTax spokesman said, noting that the IRS received accurate banking information. We are partnering with the IRS to help taxpayers receive their payments as quickly as possible.\n\nIf someone's Turbo Visa Debit Card account was closed or inactive, the bank will return the stimulus money, according to a TurboTax FAQ.\n\nAt H&R Block, a company statement said, We immediately deposited millions of stimulus payments to customers' bank accounts and onto our Emerald Prepaid Mastercard yesterday, and all direct deposits are being processed.\n\nIf the IRS 'Get My Payment' portal shows an account number the customer doesn't recognize, the company said H&R Block customer service can help at 1-800-HRBLOCK or @HRBlockAnswers.\n\nThe economic impact payment money that was sent to closed accounts affected less than 1% of second stimulus payments processed by H&R Block, a company press release said Monday.\n\nThe angry wait echoes distribution glitches during the first round of checks, as well as an episode from last week, some Wells Fargo WFC, +1.25% customers trained their Twitter ire on the bank. That wasn't lost on at least one person.\n\nWells Fargo said it's supporting customers as quickly as possible and the bank has processed all direct deposits its received so far from the IRS. People who were wired money effective for automatic deposit on Jan. 4 could use it as soon as Jan. 1, a spokesman said.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury has indicated payments will be distributed in multiple phases, and not everyone will receive funds at the same time, he noted.\n\nThe bank's branch and contact center staff don't have extra information on whether customers will get paper checks, pre-paid cards or the timing that electronic payments post, he added.
Shares of Tesla Inc. tumbled Wednesday, after the electric vehicle maker reported fourth-quarter deliveries that missed expectations. The company also said it would lower prices in an attempt to mitigate the reduction of a federal tax credit that had helped to buttress sales.\n\nTesla reported that deliveries during the last three months of 2018, rose 8% sequentially to 90,700, below the FactSet consensus of 92,000.\n\nModel 3 deliveries grew 13% to 63,150 vehicles, which missed the FactSet consensus of 64,900, the 14,050 Model X vehicles delivered were below expectations of 14,200 and the 13,500 Model S deliveries fell short of expectations of 13,600.\n\nProduction during the quarter rose 8% sequentially to 86,555 vehicles, including a 15% increase in Model 3s to 61,394 vehicles.\n\nSeparately, Tesla said it would cut prices of its Model 3, S and X vehicles in the U.S. by $2,000 each, effective immediately, as it takes steps to partially absorb the halving of the federal EV tax credit to $3,750 from $7,500, as of Jan. 1.\n\nTesla's stock TSLA, -4.39% dropped 6.6% in active trade, but pared earlier losses of as much as 10.2%. Trading volume topped 10 million shares with an hour left in the session, compared with the full-day average of about 7.1 million shares.\n\nThe company said international deliveries of Model 3 vehicles in Europe and China will start in February 2019. In November, Chief Executive Elon Musk said he expected China deliveries to begin in the first quarter, starting with some deliveries in March.\n\nSee also: Tesla was weeks from dying earlier this year, Elon Musk says.\n\nThere remain significant opportunities to continue to grow Model 3 sales by expanding to international markets, introducing lower-priced variants and offering leasing, the company said in a statement. Expansion of Model 3 sales to other market\n\nExpansion of Model 3 sales to other international markets, including a right-hand drive vehicles, will begin later in 2019, the company said.\n\nAnalyst Romit Shah at Instinet said he expects fourth-quarter deliveries to be as good as it gets for the next three to six months, given an in-transit lag with Europe, the phase out of the U.S. tax credit, lower Model 3 backlog and evidence of a slowing global economy.\n\nShah reiterated the neutral rating he's had on the stock since September, and kept his price target at $300, which is more than 3% below current levels.\n\nTesla bull Dan Ives at Wedbush Securities said he was surprised that there wasn't a significant pull forward in deliveries, even though potential buyers knew that a EV tax credit was coming. While Tesla's price cuts could help soften the blow of the tax credit cut, it's not what the bulls wanted to hear given the impact on profitability.\n\nHe said Tesla still had a strong fourth quarter, but the price cuts and the fact that deliveries missed expectations will be a cloud over the name until the company reports earnings in late January and gives initial guidance for European Model 3 demand for 2019.\n\nStill, Ives kept his rating at outperform and his price target at $440.\n\nThe stock was still up 3.2% over the past three months, but was now down 3.1% over the past 12 months. In comparison, shares of General Motors Co. GM, -1.42% have plunged 19.6% over the past year and Ford Motor Co. shares F, -5.38% have plummeted 37.3%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.16% has lost 7.0% over the past 12 months.\n\nTesla's stock outperformance has pushed its market value, currently at about $53.4 billion, above GM's at $47.4 billion and Ford's at $31.6 billion.

The European Union is failing, and populism — ordinary folks are rebelling against the hubris of elites — is rising.\n\nThe EU's primary antecedent, European Economic Community (1957), was structured to bring down barriers to trade — a customs union with antitrust enforcement powers to crack the cartelization of national markets by private and public actors — and permit workers and capital to move freely across borders.\n\nIt has since morphed into an expansive bureaucracy that dictates all manner of immigration, economic and social policies but has not attained the democratic institutions and fiscal powers necessary to manage a continental economy.\n\nFree trade always has victims, but the EEC delivered dynamic growth from the consolidation of businesses across national boundaries. And just as international economic textbooks predict, the rising tide raised all boats. In recent decades, however, the EU's expanded bureaucracy reach and single currency have not delivered enough growth.\n\nProfessionals in big cities profit from globalization but the working classes in suburbs, smaller cities and rural communities languish. Immigrants corrupt local cultures and incubate crime, and burdensome regulations and high taxes make starting a business and affording simple necessities too difficult.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron sought to impose a new tax on petrol, which is already terribly expensive in France. The bankers in Paris ride the subway but folks in the hinterland must fuel up to get to work. Most discretionary driving has already been taxed away — the levy would have had little impact on CO2 emissions but create much hardship.\n\nThe gilets jaunes riots inspired Macron to react like a man controlled by an alien force. Confronted by complaints that fuel taxes were crushing ordinary people, Macron lectured about the need to lower carbon emissions and reminded when we change things, we shake up habits and people aren't necessarily happy.\n\nLet them eat cake!\n\nThe EU bureaucracy is now cracking down on duly-elected national governments to force Italy to adhere to the eurozone's unworkable national budget rules, Hungary to take down its border fence and stop enforcing its national immigration laws, and Poland to block its efforts to make its judiciary accountable to Polish values and not those of international civil society.\n\nIn Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel's open immigration policies have imposed disastrous social consequences and crime. Meanwhile her designated successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, muses Germany through the social market economy and our system of social partnership, we have a system where many issues and conflicts are always discussed and settled in orderly structures.\n\nLet them discuss Kant.\n\nBritons sensing the madness voted for Brexit but Prime Minister Theresa May did not support leaving. In negotiations, she acceded to nearly every EU demand. Now she can't get enough parliamentary or Conservative Party support for an open-ended transition agreement that could indefinitely impose EU trade policies, regulations and taxes on her countrymen.\n\nUnable to keep the U.K. in the EU, May would make it a colony.\n\nBritons should read the Declaration of Independence, and get a new prime minister — pronto!\n\nThe new leader could inform European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker and all the other oligarchs of Europe's ruling class that on March 29 — the date the U.K. is scheduled to leave — his government will declare unilateral free trade with Europe. It would continue to permit EU banks and professionals to do business and work in the UK if the EU does the same.\n\nBrussels can take it or leave it — remember the continent needs London's financial sector and U.K. markets as much as the U.K. industries needs theirs. If the EU doesn't comply, then London doesn't pay the $50 billion divorce settlement and makes a hard break.\n\nThe transition would be painful for Britain but Europe will still need London's financial sector to enable its follies — European banking would no more move from London to Frankfort than American banking would move to Charlotte if Manhattan became an independent country.\n\nAnyway the future is in artificial intelligence and other such stuff where the U.K. will do a lot better unchained from EU dysfunction.\n\nItaly and others would follow and that would begin the process of returning the EU to its original but more limited mission — free trade!
Investors are increasingly skeptical of President-elect Donald Trump's plans to enact pro-growth economic policies, according to a proprietary gauge of investor sentiment compiled by Citigroup Inc.\n\nThe News Implied Sentiment Indicator, or NISI, has reversed most of its postelection rise, as the chart from the Citigroup team of macro analysts illustrates:\n\nBloomberg and Citigroup Research\n\nThe index aims to capture investor sentiment by measuring the number of Bloomberg News stories containing the keywords bullish and bearish. The index is correlated to risk assets, as well as Citigroup's Global Risk Aversion Macro Index, or GRAMI, the analysts said. Occasionally, turning points in the NISI precipitate moves corresponding moves in stocks, they said.\n\nRead: Investors are bracing for a massive stock-market selloff\n\nAlso read:Trump sends shivers through stock market on 'too strong' dollar comments\n\nThe expectation that Trump would be able to follow through on promises to roll out a massive infrastructure-spending bill, cut corporate taxes, and repeal a broad swath of back of Wall Street regulations, likely helped spark the rally, the strategists said.\n\nHowever, the index has swung back to neutral in the opening weeks of 2017. This suggest that the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% could retreat to around 2,200 in the near term, the strategists said. It's presently trading at 2,266.\n\nIs some of the optimism fuelled by Trump fading perhaps?, The Citigroup analysts said. For what it's worth, prediction markets are pricing in a 50% probability that Trump‎ won't finish out the term in office.\n\nAccording to recent polls, Trump's approval ratings have fallen since the election. Surveys from CNN/ORC and ABC News/Washington Post released on Tuesday showed a majority of Americans harbor an unfavorable view of the president-elect, Politico reported. Trump will be sworn in to office on Friday.\n\nIn the market, several popular Trump trades have reversed or stalled in recent weeks. Gold prices GLD, -0.58% have risen about 8% from their postelection lows, the dollar DXY, +0.43% is about 3% softer and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% has retreated after coming within a hair's breadth of the 20,000 milestone.\n\nTrump rattled markets on Tuesday after he said a congressional Republican proposal for a border-tax adjustment was too complicated. He also said he believes more countries will leave the European Union in the coming years, and that the one-China policy, which counts Taiwan as an autonomous region of the People's Republic of China, is up for negotiation. His comments were published by The Wall Street Journal over the weekend.
KB Home KBH, -4.29% said Thursday it had net income of $44 million, or 43 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, down from $852.8 million, or $8.36 a share, in the year-earlier period, which was boosted by a tax gain. Revenue rose 24% to $985.8 million. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of 50 cents and revenue of $1.068 billion. While inclement weather and trade shortages in certain markets tempered our fourth-quarter deliveries and revenues, we have a positive rhythm in our business and substantial momentum as we enter 2016, Chief Executive Jeffrey Mezger said in a statement. The company had a backlog of $1.28 billion at the end of the quarter, up 40% from the year earlier. The number of homes in backlog rose 36% to 3,966. Shares were not yet active in premarket trade, but are down 28% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 is down 1.8%.
Before you can safely retire, you need to know that your income will cover your expenses. But many of the following costs can catch retirees by surprise. Anticipating these common budget-busters could help you prepare for a more comfortable and less stressful retirement.\n\nMost Americans say they want to age in place, or remain in their current home as they get older. But homes age as well, and the repair bills tend to increase as they do. A home inspection before you retire could alert you to looming problems and give you some idea of the costs you can expect. (Home inspections typically range from $278 to $391, according to contractor matching site HomeAdvisor.)\n\nOn average, households spend about $1,000 a year on home repairs and maintenance, according to the 2018 Consumer Expenditure Survey. You'd be smart to budget at least that amount, and consider saving additional cash in your emergency fund for larger expenses. A home equity line of credit also could come in handy.\n\nHome renovations\n\nMost U.S. houses aren't designed with aging in mind. Only about 1% of the national housing stock can be considered truly accessible if you need a wheelchair, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. Even if you don't, your ability to live safely at home could be thwarted by stairs, narrow hallways and knobs instead of levers on doors and faucets.\n\nSee: Retiring and want to stay in your home? Here are your options\n\nYou may be able to adapt your home to safer aging if your place has (or could have) at least one bedroom on the same level as the kitchen, a full bathroom and the laundry room. Ideally, you would also have a no-step entry, wide hallways and doorways, smooth, carpet-free flooring and ample room in the bathroom to accommodate an aide, if necessary.\n\nTransportation\n\nYou may be giving up a commute, but you're probably not giving up your keys just yet. The average household headed by someone age 65 to 74 spent $8,810 a year on transportation in 2018, according to the Consumer Expenditure Survey. Those 75 and older spent $5,098.\n\nAlso see: 5 people on why they keep working past age 65\n\nYou may save money by driving less or winnowing down from a two- or three-car household to just one vehicle. You also may own cars longer since they're getting less wear and tear. But even if you replace cars every eight to 10 years, you still have substantial costs ahead you need to estimate and budget for.\n\nFamily members\n\nIt's now the norm for parents to give cash to adult children or pay some of their bills, and the help doesn't necessarily end at retirement. About half of parents 60 and over provided financial support to an adult child in the previous 12 months, according to a 2013 Pew Research Center study. Seven percent of adults 60 and over were helping to support a parent.\n\nIf you have able-bodied adults relying on you for financial infusions, it may be time to close the Bank of Mom and Dad. Otherwise, financial support needs to be factored into your postretirement budget.\n\nMedicare premiums\n\nSome people don't realize Medicare has premiums, while others don't know the premiums can vary according to income.\n\nMedicare Part A, which covers hospitalization, is premium-free for most people. The standard monthly premium for Medicare Part B, which covers doctor's visits, is $135.50 for 2020. Medicare Part D premiums averaged about $40 a month in 2019. Many people also pay premiums for supplemental policies, also known as Medigap, or for Medicare Advantage plans, an all-in-one private alternative to federally administered Medicare.\n\nIndividuals with yearly income above $85,000 and married couples with incomes above $170,000 pay more for Medicare Part B, with the additional amounts ranging from $54.10 to $325 per person a month. The surcharges for Part D start at $12.50 and top out at $77.40 per person a month.\n\nOther health care costs\n\nMedicare won't cover all your health care expenses in retirement. How much you'll pay out of pocket depends on your health, where you live and what coverage you buy, according to Vanguard and Mercer Health and Benefits, which released a study on typical medical costs last year. The study estimated that a typical 65-year-old woman in 2018 could expect to pay $5,200, but her costs could range from $3,000 to $26,200.\n\nYou can use NerdWallet's retirement health cost estimator to see how much you might pay.\n\nTaxes and the earnings test\n\nThe money you take out of IRAs and 401(k)s is typically taxable, as is your pension income. About half of Social Security recipients pay income taxes on their benefits because their incomes are above certain limits. Furthermore, if you start Social Security early and continue to work, your benefits can be reduced by your earnings.\n\nSome strategies, including delaying the start of Social Security, may help you minimize taxes and maximize your lifetime income. Consulting with a tax pro before you retire can help you determine the best strategy.\n\nLong-term care\n\nYour costs for long-term care could be catastrophic, nonexistent or somewhere between. About half of the elderly won't have to pay for long-term care, the Vanguard study estimated. This group either won't need help or will have unpaid caregivers such as a spouse or adult child. Another quarter can expect to incur costs of less than $100,000, while 15% can expect to pay more than $250,000.\n\nRelated: A new way to pay for the single biggest expense in retirement\n\nLong-term care insurance may be one solution if you can get it and afford it. Otherwise, consider keeping some money in reserve, says Jean Young, senior research associate with Vanguard Center for Investor Research. Retirees could earmark some of their investments or their home equity for this purpose.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:
When people do estate planning, they often don't think about supporting the causes that have been important to them. Yet, it turns out that most people do want to use their estates to help change the world. When asked about giving during the estate planning process, people give up to six times more if they're reminded to think about it.\n\nWe know this because we co-founded FreeWill — an online tool that helps people with estate planning and encourages them to think about making a bequest (a gift in will or trust).\n\nHere are four reasons why it's a good idea to think about leaving some assets to causes that are meaningful to you:\n\n1. It makes estate planning easier to think about (and sometimes even enjoyable). Only 54% of U.S. adults over 55 have a will that directs where their money will go once they pass away. And fewer than 30 percent of all Americans have an up-to-date will. One big reason so many of us die without making our wishes known to our loved ones and others is that dying is an event we may not want to contemplate. Framing a discussion in a more positive light — about the impact you would like to make, from saving the redwoods to supporting your local church or synagogue — triggers happy memories. That transforms a potentially miserable process into a source of joy.\n\n2. It's likely to be the most important donation you'll ever make. An Internal Revenue Service study found that a typical bequest is almost three times as large as the total amount that person has donated in his or her lifetime (on FreeWill, it averages at $69,000). Choosing causes on which you're going to have an enormous impact is immensely satisfying. But with so much money at stake, it's worth thinking carefully about where you want to have impact and why.\n\n3. Charities are ready to celebrate you. A new bequest can mean a dramatic increase in a nonprofit's ability to have impact. Many organizations have legacy societies to honor people who have put a gift in their future plans. People within the legacy society are invited to special events, given gifts and warmly thanked. The Cleveland Museum of Art, for example, has yearly receptions and tours for members of its Legacy Society. Save the Redwoods League does something similar. These events give you the opportunity to meet like-minded people and receive recognition for your generosity.\n\n4. Thinking about giving at death can change your life today. A will is actually one of the most profound manifestations of your own values. In making the decision about where their money goes, people often end up with a deeper understanding of themselves, what matters most to them, and why.\n\nDon't miss: Has the new tax law stopped people from giving to charity?\n\nSome people know which causes they would like to assist; they've been working on issues close to their heart for years. Others prefer to explore and understand the impact they may have.\n\nIf you're part of the latter group, we recommend checking out these resources to help:\n\nCharity Navigator for a summary of financial metrics, mission and similar charities with more than $1 million in annual revenue.\n\nGuidestar for detailed financial data on charities based on federal tax filings.\n\nGivewell for in-depth research on international economic development nonprofits.\n\nAnimal Charity Evaluators to understand the impact of those types of nonprofits.\n\nHow to make a bequest in your will\n\nFor many people, making a bequest in a will is straightforward. You simply specify the share of your assets or absolute value you would like to go to a good cause. When doing this, it's worth writing a note explaining why the issue matters to you and any specific element of the nonprofit's work you prefer to assist.\n\nA number of sites online (including ours) offer the opportunity to make a will with a bequest. For more complex, or large, bequests, it's best to talk to an attorney.
Financial security isn't a number or a threshold. It has to do with what you spend, and save, relative to your income.\n\nNothing proves that quite like research on millionaires by wealth management firm UBS. UBS, +1.71% Sixty percent of those with more than $5 million defined themselves as wealthy, compared with 28% of those worth $1 million to $5 million. Yet what millionaires mean by wealthy is not necessarily financial independence: Only 10% defined wealthy as not having to work. It's not even a number; only 16% said surpassing a certain asset threshold automatically made you rich.\n\nThe majority — two-thirds of those polled — said the whole point of building wealth was achieving financial security, where a single setback isn't likely to plunge them into the ranks of the not-rich.\n\nHalf of those worth $1 million to $5 million believed that one bad break, such as a market crash or a job loss, would have a major impact on their lifestyle. Only 34% of those with more than $5 million felt the same.\n\nYou may not have a million-dollar lifestyle to protect, and neither do I. But financial security for the middle class is achieved in exactly the same way.\n\n8 steps to financial security\n\nAs soon as you spend less than you earn, then save the surplus, you've made a start. You're inching away from the financial edge and insulating yourself from shocks that could send you down the economic ladder.\n\nOver time, you keep building that cushion while insuring yourself against catastrophic expenses that could wipe out what you've saved. Eventually, you can achieve financial independence, where your income in retirement is sufficient to cover your expenses and some extras.\n\nHere's how you do it:\n\nStart with a small emergency fund. You don't need much to begin — $500 is enough to cover many unwelcome expenses, such as a medical deductible or a small car repair. If an expense drains your fund, build it up again so it's ready for the next setback. You can't build security without a way to deal with the unexpected.\n\nPay off toxic debt. Credit card debt is expensive. Payday and auto title loans are much worse. If you can't see how to pay off your high-rate debt within five years, consult a credit counselor and a bankruptcy attorney about your debt options.\n\nLimit your overhead. Keep your must-have expenses — shelter, utilities, food, transportation, insurance, minimum loan payments — to 50% or less of your after-tax income. A smaller nut also makes it easier to pay your bills should you lose your job or be unable to work.\n\nInvest in your future, year in and year out. Take full advantage of any company match you're offered in a workplace retirement plan — and do so even if you're paying off toxic debt, because matches are free money. No workplace plan? Fund an IRA. Use a retirement calculator to ballpark how much you should be contributing. If you can't contribute enough right now, start where you can and increase the amount over time.\n\nInsure against catastrophe. Health insurance can prevent bankrupting medical bills. Disability insurance can replace your income if you can't work. Life insurance protects your dependents. Liability insurance can cover lawsuits that might otherwise wipe you out. As you accumulate wealth, make sure you increase the liability limits on your home and auto insurance to at least equal your net worth.\n\nBuild your emergency fund. Once you've paid off bad debt and gotten on track with retirement, focus on boosting your emergency fund. Your first goal can be three months' worth of those must-have expenses.\n\nRetire your mortgage. Having a paid-for home by the time you retire won't just help you sleep better at night. It also means you don't have to withdraw as much from your retirement funds, since you're not making mortgage payments. A lower withdrawal rate can make your savings last longer. You also can turn your equity into income if necessary through a reverse mortgage or by downsizing.\n\nCreate guaranteed streams of income. In retirement, your basic expenses should be covered by income you can count on. If Social Security isn't enough to cover your basics, consider buying an immediate annuity, where you give an insurance company a chunk of money in return for a lifetime stream of monthly checks.\n\nFinancial security is all about peace of mind. You can begin to build it on almost any income, and you can start today.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:
Congressional Democrats have signaled they may use a fast-track budget process to push through the next round of U.S. pandemic economic aid, which Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said would boost the size of stimulus checks paid to lower income Americans.\n\nThe optional process, called a budget reconciliation, would allow a bill containing the payments to pass the Senate with only a simple majority, instead of the 60 votes usually required to end debate on legislation. Schumer has said the payments should rise to $2,000 per family member instead of the current $600 under current legislation passed last week,\n\nThe downside of using the reconciliation procedure is it could take longer than Democrats want and its use would require the bill to be more narrow in scope than they would prefer.\n\nWith Democrats newly in the Majority in the Senate and the inauguration of the new Biden-Harris Administration just two weeks away, all options are on the table as we consider the best way to address the crises at hand and lead our nation forward, said House Budget Chairman John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat, in a statement.\n\nThat includes potentially using reconciliation to advance critical priorities for American families, he said.\n\nA House Democratic aide, on condition of anonymity, said no when asked if reconciliation would be take too long to be useful for passing another round of stimulus.\n\nThe reconciliation procedure has been used for major bills in the past, like part of the Affordable Care Act and the 2017 tax cut bill, but usually the process has taken months. Democrats have said they would like to see a new round of fiscal stimulus soon after Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20.\n\nSchumer reiterated that idea Wednesday in a brief news conference on Capitol Hill. With the Democratic wins of Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff in the Georgia Senate runoff elections on Tuesday, Schumer would become the new Senate majority leader once Kamala Harris is seated as vice president to break Senate tie votes.\n\nOne of the first things that I want to do when our new senators are seated is to deliver the $2,000 checks to American families, Schumer said.\n\nReconciliation has mostly been used for partisan bills where the minority party is not expected to support the proposal. Its name comes from a time when Congress used to pass two budget resolutions a year laying out spending, revenue and debt targets. The bills spun out from one of those resolutions were meant to reconcile changes from the first budget.\n\nWhile now Congress is doing well to pass even one budget blueprint annually, and hasn't since 2017 when the House and Senate were under unified GOP control, the reconciliation tag has stuck.\n\nUnder it, the two chambers of Congress must pass a budget resolution with specific instructions to committees on how much in spending cuts or increases to target or how much in tax increases or cuts to target. Other legislation can be written to raise the federal debt limit.\n\nThe committees then write legislation to meet those targets and that language is bundled together, usually into one bill. Legislation that is spun out of the budget resolution is protected from filibuster in the Senate, meaning it can pass with only 51 votes instead of the 60 ,\n\nBut there are limitations to the procedure. The reconciliation bills cannot increase the budget deficit beyond the years covered by the budget resolution, which is why President Bush's tax cuts were originally temporary. The bills cannot deal with Social Security. And the changes proposed must have a budget effect by changing spending or revenues in a non-incidental way. Violations of those rules can result in the offending provisions being stripped out or the bill losing its filibuster protection.\n\nGoing through the reconciliation process usually takes at least several weeks and involves adopting budget resolutions that are usually very tight party-line votes, followed by committee action, and then the passage of the reconciliation bills themselves. Bill Hoagland, a long-time ex-Capitol Hill budget staffer for Republicans, said he doubted Democrats would turn to reconciliation so soon.\n\nI think the time it would take to pass a budget resolution and reconciliation bill would not address the immediate issue of COVID and so they would direct their attention on an emergency supplemental rather than a reconciliation bill, he said.\n\nDemocrats will have the ability to take two bites at the reconciliation apple this year, if they choose to, so they could use one of those for extra fiscal stimulus and keep one in reserve. They could pass two budget resolutions – one for the current fiscal year ending in October and the traditional one for the upcoming budget year, as Republicans did in 2017.\n\nThat is an option at our disposal, said the House Democratic aide.\n\nUsing reconciliation would also help Democrats avoid a potentially bruising intraparty battle over whether to do away with the filibuster in the Senate. Enough Democratic senators have expressed reluctance to do so that scrapping the filibuster appears unlikely, but that could change if Republicans are seen as unyielding.\n\nSubstituting two rounds of reconciliation legislation for scrapping the filibuster would be a mistake, according to Fix Our Senate, a group that wants to overhaul Senate rules, like the filibuster, that it says have been abused by Republicans to stop popular legislation.\n\nReconciliation can be a useful tool to allow a simple majority to pass some critical policies, but it can't do everything and it's not a substitute for eliminating the filibuster and delivering on the promises made, said Eli Zupnick, spokesman for the the group.
Southwest Airlines Co. LUV, -1.34% said late Tuesday its board of directors agreed to pay a $1,000 bonus to all full-time and part-time employees to celebrate the recent passage of the tax reform legislation. The employees will get the bonus on Jan. 8. We are excited about the savings and additional capital, which we intend to put to work in several forms--to reward our hard-working employees, to reinvest in our business, to reward our shareholders, and to keep our costs and fares low for our customers, Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly said in a statement. Shares of Southwest rose 0.2% in late Tuesday trading after ending the regular trading session up 1.3%. Netflix Inc. NFLX, -3.75% said last week it plans on giving its executives a raise, citing the tax overhaul, and several banks, including Bank of America Corp. BAC, +2.61% and Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +2.43% , and other companies, such as Comcast Corp. CMCSA, -2.83% , have announced similar plans.
If you're wealthy, then you stand to benefit from Donald Trump's tax plan… right? That's the theme that most analyses of the president-elect's tax plan have focused on: The rich will pay less. But there are some higher-income Americans who may wind up paying more taxes under Trump than they have in past years.\n\nIf your taxable income falls into one of these groups, then you are one of them (taxable income here refers to your gross income — not adjusted gross income, which includes deductions or exemptions):\n\n— Individual tax filer: Between $112,500 and $190,150\n\n— Married or joint filers: Between $225,000 and $231,450\n\nTaxpayers reporting income in those ranges would see their marginal tax rate rise from 28% under current policy to 33% under the plan Trump proposed during his campaign. (Your marginal tax rate is the amount of tax paid on your next dollar of income, as you move into a higher tax bracket. It is not your overall, or effective, tax rate, which is typically lower.)\n\nThat means a single filer earning $190,150 (and taking the standard deduction) could pay $3,000 more in taxes under Trump's proposed plan, according to personal finance writer Sam Dogen. A single filer making $130,000 could pay $875 more in taxes, and joint filers who report gross income of $231,450 could see their taxes go up by about $320.\n\nIf you're doubting if someone with income in those ranges is wealthy, consider that the median household income in the U.S. is $55,775 and, even in expensive San Francisco, it's $90,500.\n\nStuck in the middle?\n\nThe hallmark of Trump's plan, which the Tax Foundation has estimated could cost as much as $6 trillion over the next decade in lost tax revenue, is lowering the number of tax brackets from seven to three: 12%, 25% and 33%. This would squeeze many taxpayers into a lower bracket than their current one, and some would move into a higher marginal tax bracket.\n\nThis graphic from HowMuch visualizes that squeezing (it calculates tax-bracket changes assuming filers use the standard deduction, which would increase under Trump's plan). As it shows, the richest taxpayers at the top see gains, and the poorest taxpayers at the bottom get hurt. But there is one slice of wealthy taxpayers in the upper brackets that would also get hurt — or, at least, benefit the least from the changes.\n\nThe number of people in this bracket is likely very small — less than 2% of American households, according to 2013 Internal Revenue Service data. In total, about 20% of all American households would see their taxes rise under Trump's plan, according to the Tax Policy Center.\n\n'A little causality of simplification'\n\nAlan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation, says that most people assume reducing the number of tax brackets is one way to simplify the U.S.'s extraordinarily complex tax code — which has been a rallying cry for politicians, particularly on the Republican side of the aisle. The tax code contains about 4 million words — longer than the Bible, as Sen. Ted Cruz famously noted.\n\nBut, Cole says, reducing brackets is a minor simplification of the code, and one that won't have much of an effect.\n\nAdvocates for simplifying the tax code suggest that, to make a real difference, legislators would need to also turn their attention to the earned income tax credit, capital gains and education tax benefits, just to name a few issues.\n\nOf course, simply belonging to this relatively well-off, but newly tax-disadvantaged bracket doesn't guarantee your taxes will increase. Trump's plan would also add a new deduction for childcare expenses, plus other benefits for child and dependent care, and eliminate the alternative minimum tax and estate and gift taxes, all of which could affect your rate.\n\nAnd Trump's proposed plan is just that — a proposal, not policy, with many variables yet to come into focus.\n\nBut anytime the number of tax brackets is reduced, there will be winners and losers at all levels of the income scale. And those who fall into this camp would see less benefit — possibly considerably less — than any other upper-income bracket.\n\nWhen reducing the number of brackets, you don't want to have too much of a tax cut, but you also want to try to approximate something like the original curve, Cole said. The result of that means sometimes if you're not super generous all the way across, you're going to end up with a tax increase for some. It's a little causality of simplification.\n\nWhen merging tax brackets, there is no way for everybody to win and for there to not be losers, said tax attorney Mark Allison, of Caplin & Drysdale.\n\nAllison said that, for now, taxpayers shouldn't worry about the potential upheaval coming.\n\nDo what you would do without regard to potential tax changes, he said. If you need to sell an asset today, sell it. If you want to ride things out, ride things out. Don't let potential tax issues control your financial plans.\n\nFor more information on positioning yourself for tax savings under Donald Trump's tax plan, see Bill Bischoff's tips for reducing your tax bill.
What do you give a billionaire president for Christmas?\n\nFor U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, the answer to that question was a copy of her predecessor's historic speech to Americans on Christmas Eve 1941.\n\nTo mark this special time of year, I wanted to share with you this gift marking a Christmas-time address to the American people from perhaps the most famous British-American, Winston Churchill, May wrote in a letter to U.S. President Donald Trump dated Dec. 29, according to a Times of London report earlier this month.\n\nWhile Churchill's words came at the dark time of world war, I think the sentiment he expressed — of a sense of unity and fraternal association between the United Kingdom and United States — is just as true today as it has ever been, she added.\n\nThe text of Churchill's 1941 radio address from the White House is given below.\n\nFor his part, Trump plans to meet with May on Friday to lay the groundwork for a U.S.-U.K. trade deal. Trump, whose mother was born in the U.K., also has predicted that Brexit will end up being a great thing.\n\nThere has been buzz about Trump putting a Churchill bust back in the Oval Office, but it's not clear that former President Obama actually removed such a statue to send a message.\n\nChurchill's 1941 Christmas Message\n\nI spend this anniversary and festival far from my country, far from my family, yet I cannot truthfully say that I feel far from home. Whether it be the ties of blood on my mother's side, or the friendships I have developed here over many years of active life, or the commanding sentiment of comradeship in the common cause of great peoples who speak the same language, who kneel at the same altars and, to a very large extent, pursue the same ideals, I cannot feel myself a stranger here in the center and at the summit of the United States. I feel a sense of unity and fraternal association which, added to the kindliness of your welcome, convinces me that I have a right to sit at your fireside and share your Christmas joys.\n\nThis is a strange Christmas Eve. Almost the whole world is locked in deadly struggle, and, with the most terrible weapons which science can devise, the nations advance upon each other. Ill would it be for us this Christmastide if we were not sure that no greed for the land or wealth of any other people, no vulgar ambition, no morbid lust for material gain at the expense of others, had led us to the field. Here, in the midst of war, raging and roaring over all the lands and seas, creeping nearer to our hearts and homes, here, amid all the tumult, we have tonight the peace of the spirit in each cottage home and in every generous heart. Therefore we may cast aside for this night at least the cares and dangers which beset us, and make for the children an evening of happiness in a world of storm. Here, then, for one night only, each home throughout the English-speaking world should be a brightly-lighted island of happiness and peace.\n\nLet the children have their night of fun and laughter. Let the gifts of Father Christmas delight their play. Let us grown-ups share to the full in their unstinted pleasures before we turn again to the stern task and the formidable years that lie before us, resolved that, by our sacrifice and daring, these same children shall not be robbed of their inheritance or denied their right to live in a free and decent world.\n\nAnd so, in God's mercy, a happy Christmas to you all.\n\n(Text via the International Churchill Society.)\n\nTrump says he'll make trade deal with U.K. after Brexit\n\nRead more: Trump singles out BMW, Mercedes-Benz in tough talk on trade\n\nAnd see: German minister to Trump after tax threat: U.S. needs to build better cars\n\nThis story was first published on Jan. 16, 2017.

Shares of Boeing Co. BA, +0.14% fell in Thursday's extended session after the aircraft maker said it would cut back production on 747s to 0.5 plane per month by September from one currently. Global air passenger traffic growth and airplane demand remain strong, but the air cargo market recovery that began in late 2013 has stalled in recent months and slowed demand for the 747-8 Freighter, said Ray Conner, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. As a result, the company will report a $569 million after-tax charge in the fourth quarter. Boeing shares were off 1.5% in after-hours trading.
Perhaps one of the clearest indications that a rally inspired by President-elect Donald Trump is starting to stall is shiny and yellow and is outperforming other assets by a healthy margin.\n\nGold futures US:GCG7 are trading more than $1,200 an ounce and are up around 5.5% so far in 2017, compared with a tepid gain of 0.3% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% and a 1.3% advance by the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% . Not even the standout Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% , with a 2.9% return, has managed to outstrip gold's rise.\n\nRead:Here's why Trump's inauguration could mark a near-term top for stocks\n\nAlso read: MarketWatch's stock-market column, snapshot\n\nOf course, the market is only about halfway though the first month of 2017 and things could pivot quickly. After all, stocks began 2016 with the worst start to a new year in history before regaining their footing and storming to new records.\n\nThat said, for a little perspective, from the start of last year to Jan. 18, 2016, gold was only up about 2.8%, while the Dow and the S&P 500 were both off more than 8% during that period, according to FactSet data.\n\nIt also is worth noting that, gold's less prominent sister metal, silver US:SIH7, is doing even better in 2017, up about 7.6%. Silver was up 0.7% from the start of last year to Jan. 18.\n\nBut what appears to be a stall-out for equities—though not an outright reversal—highlights investors' apparent reassessment of some of the factors that had accelerated a rally in equities after Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. In theory, the prospect of economic growth and rising inflation are bullish for the dollar, stocks, but bad news for assets like gold, which doesn't bear a yield and is priced in dollars.\n\nI am not surprised by the reversal we have seen in relative performance between gold and US stocks so far in 2017. The big rally at the end of last year was partly driven by speculation on what Donald Trump could do for the economy as president and part due to a scramble by fund managers to get cash off the sidelines and into the market by year-end which is now over, said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. It also seemed to me like the Dow was getting drawn toward 20,000 as though it was caught in a tractor beam, he said.\n\nBut, the ebullience that lifted stocks to fresh highs, bolstered by the notion of fiscal stimulus, tax cuts and a loosening of regulations, has been replaced, for the moment, by a demand for details and doubts that the president-elect can deliver the fiscal goods.\n\nCheck out:Here's the right way for stock-market investors to trade Trump in 2017\n\nThose factors may be offering gold room to run higher, at least in the near term.\n\nA retreat by the U.S. dollar, which has steadily pulled back from a more-than 14-year peak, as measured by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.43% and lower moves for benchmark Treasury yields, with the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.711% at 2.32% from a high of 2.61% in mid December, underscore a recent tapering of a selloff for government bonds. Yields fall as bond prices climb.\n\nRecent buying in gold, and maybe bonds, can be attributed to minutes from the Federal Reserve that raised questions about the pace of interest-rate hikes in 2017. Trump also has influenced trading in the dollar by saying the currency has gotten too strong.\n\nIt may be way too early to call the Trump rally over. Socks are sill boasting year-to-date gains and the Dow is on track to hit the 20,000 milestone, but it appears that there are some signs that the notion of Trump being a slam dunk for stocks isn't a certainty.\n\nTrump will be sworn in as president on Friday.\n\nWorth a read: Dollar, bonds and more: 'Trump trades' are unraveling—fast\n\nCheck out: Trump-rally optimism is fading fast, Citigroup says\n\nEditor's note: This article was previously published and updated Jan. 17
BEIJING (Caixin Online) – A Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm that was an early entrant in China says it will continue to bet on Internet- and mobile technology-driven businesses in the country, despite concerns that market turmoil will affect private fundraising this year.\n\nGGV Capital, an early backer of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, +1.72% , has invested in more than 50 startups in China over the past 15 years. Despite concerns that some Internet-related businesses, such as online-to-offline service providers and mobile application developers, have been overvalued by investors, creating the risk of a bubble, Hans Tung, a managing partner of GGV Capital, said he is still optimistic about investing in China's mobile Internet companies.\n\nWe believe the focus of the next 10 years will be the mobile Internet sector in China, he said. A boom in this area will come soon. If we fail to grab opportunities in the next three to five years, there will be fewer breaks after other players flood the market.\n\nMobile Internet startups received investment of $4.5 billion in 2015, up almost 70 percent from a year earlier, state-run Xinhua News Agency reported, citing data from China Venture Group, a private research firm.\n\nChina is becoming more and more important, Jixun Foo, a partner at GGV Capital, said. When we started investing in 2000, 70 percent of GGV Capital's portfolio was allocated to the U.S. market, but now nearly 70 percent of the company's investment is in China.\n\nOfficial statistics show that 3.65 million new companies were established in China in 2014, and the number of venture capital firms rose to 2,000, almost double the number in 2010.\n\nIn 2015, Forbes magazine listed Tung, Foo, and another partner at GGV Capital, Jenny Lee, among the world's top 100 best venture capital investors. The magazine also names GGV Capital as the second most successful VC firm after Sequoia Capital, which is known for big-ticket tech investments.\n\nForbes examined the performance of the investment portfolio of the companies for the five years between 2010 and 2014, said Lee. As many startups have matured, the overall investment (of GGV) is very successful.\n\nThe size of the fund managed by GGV Capital increased from $161 million to $2.6 billion from 2005 to 2012. The company's portfolio includes 19 listed companies, such as Alibaba, Qunar.com US:QUNR , the video sharing platform Youku Tudou Inc. US:YOKU , and the fast growing e-commerce startups Meilishuo.com, a website that helps users find personalized clothing, accessories and skin care products, and Xiaohongshu.com, which sells imported goods.\n\nEarly Mover\n\nChina opened to foreign venture-capital firms in 1992, and U.S.-based Pacific Technology Venture Fund, which was later renamed IDG Ventures, was one of the first to come in. In the following years, international VC firms struggled with restrictions on foreign investors and found it difficult to exit an investment.\n\nConditions improved in 1999 when the State Council, the cabinet, announced policies including tax breaks to encourage venture capital firms to invest in tech companies. Originally named Granite Global Ventures, GGV Capital started hunting for investments in China shortly after it launched in 2000.\n\nThe company's first big break came in 2003, when it invested $8 million in Alibaba during the company's second round of fundraising. GGV Capital's founding partner, Thomas Ng, had put money into Alibaba in 1999, when the company was still operating out of an apartment in the eastern city of Hangzhou. The risky investment paid off as the value of its stake grew 30 times when Alibaba went public in 2014, Forbes reported.\n\nIn 2005, GGV set up a team to focus on China-related investments. The company picked Lee, who had worked for Singapore-based VC JAFCO Asia, and Foo, an early investor in Baidu, to run its China operation based in Shanghai.\n\nAt that time, GGV didn't have a Chinese name and my Chinese was poor, Lee said. We spent six months registering the company while scouting for potential projects.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2007, the company stretched its portfolio to cover several areas that it considered to have high potential, including blogging platforms and solar energy companies, but only a few projects yielded returns.\n\nIn 2009, the company honed in on the mobile Internet sector, investing $15 million in the travel website Qunar.com. Two years later, Baidu paid $306 million for a 62 percent stake on the travel booking site. As an investor with stakes in both companies, Foo played a key role in negotiating the deal. This paved the way for Qunar to raise $167 million in a public listing on the Nasdaq in 2013.\n\nAnother high-stake bet in 2009, on yy.com, a little-known video-streaming site that lets amateur performers communicate with fans online, helped the company cut its teeth in the emerging mobile entertainment sector.\n\nMany investors had not heard of yy.com because it targets young users and its business model was unique, said Lee, who led the firm's $7.9 million investment in the startup. Many investors couldn't understand it. The company was valued at less than $70 million when we invested in it, but now its valuation is more than $3 billion. The investment has grown nearly 40 times.\n\nIn 2012, yy.com listed on the Nasdaq.\n\nNext Bet\n\nCloser international cooperation is changing business models and investor strategies.\n\nCountry borders don't matter for many startups, said Foo, citing the example of a Shanghai-based music company that he has backed that mainly offers services in North America. Internationalization is offering a lot of scope for venture capital companies.\n\nIn 2015, the company picked up stakes in several startups linked to the Internet of Things field, which refers to linking physical items to the Internet, such as your refrigerator to your smartphone. GGV raised $15 million for Zimi, which makes portable battery chargers and is affiliated to phone maker Xiaomi Inc. It also put money into PetKit that makes wearable items for pets.\n\nWe think this is the next wave in Internet 3.0, Lee told the website Tech in Asia. This is where we see the possibility of startups building disruptive business models not seen in the Internet 1.0 (PC Internet) and Internet 2.0 (mobile internet) era.\n\nSee this report at Caixin Online.

There are lots of moving parts to the FIRE movement — financial independence/retire early — but one crucial step toward achieving that coveted status is as easy to understand as it is difficult to execute: Focus on making the gap between your income and spending as wide as possible.\n\nThe Four Pillar Freedom blog's Zach created this chart to simplify what chipping away at your expenses could mean for your long-term prospects:\n\nAs you can see, the grid shows how many years it will take to hit financial independence based on your income and spending. The numbers assume a 5% return on investments and a 4% withdrawal rate once you reach financial independence.\n\nFor instance, someone earning after-tax dollars of $40,000 and spending $30,000 a year will have to wait 31.9 years to gain FIRE. In other words, if you have $10,000 left over to invest every year, and get that 5% return, it'll take that long before you have enough money to withdraw 4% of your portfolio without running out of cash.\n\nIt doesn't go beyond $100,000, but you get the idea.\n\nIf you can earn $90,000 per year and only spend $20,000 you only need to work for 6 years to have enough money to support you for the rest of your life, Zach wrote. But if you earn $90,000 and are spending $85,000 it will take you over 60 years to retire.\n\nHe pointed out that the most relevant spot in the grid is in the $40,000 to $60,000 range, where most earners find themselves.\n\nIf you earn $50,000 per year and you are spending $40,000 per year, it will take you about 36 years to reach financial independence, he said. But if you can cut your spending to $30,000 per year you would reach financial independence in 21 years.\n\nBut what if investment returns are up at a gaudy 15%, like they were in recent years? That unlikely figure probably has a lot to do with the increasing popularity of FIRE, particularly among millennials, who haven't suffered through previous bear markets. The whole concept seems a lot more achievable when your portfolio is popping... when stocks are tanking -- as they have been in December, well, some are anticipating a painful unwinding of the entire FIRE movement.\n\nAt any rate, Zach created another chart to reflect a 15% return:\n\nAs you can see, the earner waiting almost 32 years to reach FIRE in the first scenario can get it down to less than 18 with those returns, Of course, counting on those kinds of numbers going forward may be a stretch — a BIG stretch — so it's best to take aim at the factors that you can do something about.\n\nThis means focusing on increasing your income, keeping your spending in check, minimizing investment fees, and maintaining an asset allocation that aligns with your financial goals, Zach explained. If you hope to achieve financial independence in a relatively short period of time, you'll likely be better off focusing on these variables.
Dr. Martens is planning an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange, as the iconic shoe-and-boot-maker looks to expand its footprint in the £341 billion global footwear market.\n\nThe British company — known for its signature stomping boots worn by celebrities including top model Gigi Hadid and Hollywood actress Kristen Stewart, could be valued at around £3 billion ($4 billion), according to analysts.\n\nThe float, which would be one of the first big IPOs of the year, would come more than seven years after the Griggs family sold Dr. Martens for £300 million to Permira. The private equity group plans to sell down its stake as part of the IPO.\n\nThe announcement of our intention to float reflects the great achievements of the Dr. Martens team and brand over the last seven years, said Dr. Martens Chief Executive Kenny Wilson. Even more important is the significant global growth potential for Dr. Martens in the future, he added.\n\nCreated by army doctor Klaus Märtens, who designed the air-cushioned sole to help relieve his back pain, Dr. Martens — known as 'Docs' in the U.S. — first hit the British retail market in the 1960s. The classic 1460 eight-eyelet boot in cherry-red leather was initially aimed at workers who spent all day on their feet, but they were soon adopted by youth subcultures making an anti-fashion statement.\n\nThe brand was elevated to cult status after Pete Townshend, lead singer of rock band The Who, said he would go to bed on tour with two things: A cognac bottle and Dr. Martens boot. But in 2003, it fell victim to changing fashion tastes and, under pressure from falling sales, stopped all production in the U.K. and moved its factory to China and Thailand.\n\nToday, Dr. Martens sells more than 11 million pairs of shoes and boots every year in more than 60 countries. In the year to March 2020, Dr. Martens generated revenue of £672 million ($907 million), with earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of £184 million.\n\nAJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said the IPO would likely attract the attention of investors both in the U.K. and abroad, eager to see how sales are going. Its boots may look good, but the real test for investors to part with their money is whether the shares can go the distance.\n\nWhile the earning growth figures may impress, it doesn't look good when there are already holes elsewhere in the investment case, Mould added.\n\nSince taking control of the company, Permira has invested in expanding its e-commerce offering, which has been one of the key contributors to substantial growth in recent years, representing 30% of total revenue in the nine months to Dec 31, 2020.\n\nWe have invested massively to ensure that we deliver the best digital and store experiences to connect with our wearers, and through this we are driving our long term, sustainable growth, the company said.\n\nHowever, Dr. Martens is still underrepresented in some key global markets, including the U.S. and China, where it sold 12 and less than 1 pairs of boots per 1,000 population, respectively, in 2020, compared with 31 pairs per 1,000 population in the U.K.\n\nRead: China's 'unstoppable' global luxury-market share nearly doubles amid pandemic\n\nNews of Dr. Martens' planned flotation will raise hopes of a revival in the European IPO market, which has lagged behind the record-breaking run of technology IPOs in the U.S. last year.

In the financial world, what's past is prologue. Overly rosy perspectives often set off the boom-and-bust cycles that have become all-too familiar over the past 20 years, from the dot-com bubble to the mortgage crisis.\n\nOver the past 12 years, we've watched bitcoin's BTCUSD, +2.19% evolution from netherworld currency to major institutional commodity. In that time, it has fluctuated widely, introduced as a near-valueless currency in 2009, growing in value to $19,000+ nearly nine years later, then losing 76% of its market value within a year, before beginning a steady climb in the second half of 2020 that puts its value at more than $30,000.\n\nWe believe that bitcoin has matured and now is the right time to invest in this widely popular currency. Here's why:\n\nToday, there is significantly more demand for bitcoin than there is supply. About 900 new bitcoin are mined daily, and three market participants alone — PayPal, Square, and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust — purchase considerably more than 900 bitcoin a day because of high investor demand. If this dynamic continues, and we believe it will, much higher prices lie ahead for the dominant cryptocurrency.\n\nAt the same time, the risks associated with investing in bitcoin—namely the potential for theft—have been substantially diminished over the past three years, with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency authorizing national banks to provide cryptocurrency services. Several banks have also started to provide institutional bitcoin custody services, deposit-taking, custody and fiduciary services for digital assets.\n\nWhat's more, the IRS bestowed favorable tax treatment on bitcoin by treating it as property that produces capital gains and losses. And in another positive sign, PayPal rolled out bitcoin trading to its 238 million U.S. users.\n\nAs a consequence of these regulatory and infrastructure developments, Wall Street has turned bullish on bitcoin. Rick Reider, BlackRock's chief investment officer, recently commented on CNBC that bitcoin could take the place of gold…it's so much more functional than passing a bar of gold around. AllianceBernstein issued a report on Nov. 30 entitled Cryptocurrencies in asset allocation – I have changed my mind! J.P. Morgan issued a report on Dec. 3 declaring the adoption of bitcoin by institutional investors has only begun.\n\nBitcoin is now on the menu for asset allocators. It has been embraced by several legendary investors, including Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller, Bill Miller and Alan Howard, and a wall of institutional money is coming. Hedge funds are starting to buy, headlined by the Tudor BVI Global Fund and One River Asset Management. Insurance companies are starting to buy, with MassMutual recently buying a $100 million starter position in bitcoin. Pension funds are starting to buy, including two Fairfax Retirement System pension funds making investments into a Morgan Creek Digital fund. Public company treasurers are starting to buy, with MicroStrategy MSTR, +6.45% and Square SQ, +1.28% account for nearly $1.5 billion in bitcoin purchases. Registered investment advisers are starting to buy, with legendary RIA founder Ric Edelman launching the RIA Digital Assets Council.\n\nThe adoption floodgates are open.\n\nSkyBridge initiated a substantial position in bitcoin on behalf of our flagship funds in November and December, which, at today's prices, is worth $200 million, and has launched the SkyBridge Bitcoin Fund, which provides mass-affluent investors with an institutional-grade vehicle to gain exposure to bitcoin.\n\nWe credit our aha moment to Michael Saylor, the chief executive of software company MicroStrategy, who bought $1.2 billion of bitcoin in 2020. During a recent SALT Talk, Saylor made a persuasive case that bitcoin, as the undisputed winner of the cryptocurrency wars of 2017, is the dominant digital monetary network. Like Saylor, we believe that when a digital network—think Facebook, Amazon and Google—achieves a market capitalization of over $100 billion, the horse is out of the barn.\n\nBitcoin is an evolutionary step forward for the technology of money, which has steadily progressed from barter to beads to gold to fiat currency. Bitcoin is the first store of value in the world where supply is entirely unaffected by increased demand. Some 18.5 million bitcoin have been mined so far, and by 2025, over 20 million will be in circulation. Yet there can only ever be 21 million bitcoin because of a stipulation set forth in its source code.\n\nTo place that number in context, there are 42-plus million people in the world with a net worth exceeding $1 million, meaning there are twice as many millionaires today as there will ever be bitcoins in circulation.\n\nToday, the fact remains that bitcoin's demand exceeds supply, and it is not even close. Economics 101 tells us how this calculation will work out. What more do you need to know?\n\nAnthony Scaramucci is the co-founder of SkyBridge Capital and the SALT Conference.

Shares of CSX Corp. CSX, +0.40% rose 1.5% late Tuesday after the railroad company reported adjusted earnings above Wall Street expectations. CSX said it earned $4.1 billion, or $4.62 a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with $458 million, or 49 cents a share, in the year-ago period. The net earnings included a $3.6 billion tax reform benefit and a $10 million restructuring charge, the company said. Adjusted for these and other items, CSX earned $573 million, or 64 cents a share. Sales reached $2.86 billion, from $3.04 billion a year ago. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected adjusted earnings of 56 cents a share on sales of $2.88 billion. The stock ended the regular trading session down 1.9%.
Just two states in the country are spending as much on higher education per student as they did before the recession.\n\nNorth Dakota and Alaska increased higher education spending by 38% and 6% respectively between 2008 and 2014, according to a report released Thursday by Young Invincibles, a nonprofit millennial advocacy group, which has pushed a platform for debt-free college that includes increased state investment. Every other state cut higher education funding during the same period, the report found. On average, states cut per student spending by 21% during that period.\n\nYoung Invincibles graded each state on its levels of investment in higher education based on factors such as per student spending, average tuition and financial aid programs. Young Invincibles\n\nEven as the economy recovers, states' level of funding for their higher education institutions hasn't bounced back, the report found. The reasons for the cutbacks (or in two cases, the growth) in spending on colleges and universities vary based on state budget constraints, revenues and other factors. For example, it's likely North Dakota and Alaska were able to boost their higher education spending in part thanks to increased oil revenues, a resource not available in every state, said Tom Allison, the report's author.\n\nBut there may also be a broader explanation for continued disinvestment in higher education, which is that it's easy for policy makers to put funding for colleges and universities on the chopping block because constituents don't get as agitated by the cuts as they would about say, a tax increase, Allison said.\n\nYou don't have folks calling their legislators, calling their governors and paying close attention to the details of their state's higher education budgets, said Allison.\n\nStates with the largest cuts to higher education, according to Young Invincibles. Young Invincibles\n\nStates with the smallest cuts to higher education, according to Young Invincibles. Young Invincibles\n\nBut they should be, he says, because a cut in the state's higher education budget can have a direct impact on a family's budget. Between 2008 and 2014—the same time states were walking back their investment in public colleges and universities -- tuition and fees at two-year and four-year public universities rose 28% on average. The skyrocketing student debt we see is a symptom of a disease and the disease we see is state disinvestment from higher education, said Allison, Young Invincibles' deputy director of policy and research.\n\nGiven that state governments are required to balance their budgets every year, they may be hard pressed to step up their higher education funding without some kind of incentive, Allison said. Still, the report notes that Ohio, Maryland and Missouri did manage to put the brakes on tuition growth of tuition fees during the period studied by the report.\n\nOf course, the report isn't the first to draw a connection between state disinvestment in higher education and rising tuition or growing student debt. But Allison hopes that arming residents with information about how their state is treating its public colleges and universities and how that affects their pocketbooks may encourage students, their parents and others to ask their lawmakers to better fund their higher education institutions.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates have offered plans to address state disinvestment in higher education, including front-runner Hillary Clinton's proposal to award grants to states that make sure students don't have to borrow for tuition at four-year colleges and universities. Republican candidates have offered a mix of approaches to addressing student debt, including encouraging more private individuals and companies to invest in students in return for a portion of their salary postgraduation and boosting innovative higher education models such as online courses.\n\nIt's going to be necessary to have some national leadership on the issue, Allison said. The recession had serious consequences on this generation -- trying to pay for college at a time when states are basically pulling the rug out from underneath them or trying to get a job during the worst economy since the great recession.
Dear Moneyist,\n\nMy husband cheated on me, moved out of our home, and moved in with his girlfriend in October 2019. He stopped paying all the bills and doesn't pay child support, or much of anything. He filed for divorce, but because we are unable to finish paying the lawyers, our divorce is on pause.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service has deposited all the stimulus money into his account, and he will not share it with me. I finally started working this past October, and this most current stimulus check went to him again! Why did I not receive my own?\n\nWe have one minor child, and he took her share as well.\n\nStill Married,\n\nDear Married,\n\nYou may not have received a check because you did not file a tax return.\n\nIt's not 100% clear from your letter whether you have a formal separation agreement. The IRS has clear instructions on reporting people who falsely claim dependents. There are exceptions to the rules, but a child must live with the qualifying parent for more than half of the calendar year.\n\nYour estranged husband should tread carefully, as you have not lived together for over a year. When you knowingly claim a false dependent on your taxes, you risk sanctions and a potential audit from the IRS, according to CommunityTax.com.\n\nGiven the unclear legal status of your marriage, you could use the IRS policy as leverage when speaking to your husband. You can also follow the IRS instructions on reporting false claims regarding dependents, if that is what has happened here.\n\nThe government is using the IRS database as a way to determine people's eligibility for the stimulus payments. They are recoverable rebate credits on your 2020 return. The IRS is using 2019 tax returns to gauge people's incomes; 2018 tax returns are used as a Plan B.\n\nThis is not the first letter of this kind I have received during the pandemic about spouses pilfering stimulus payments. And it won't be the last. Yours may be less clear cut than some of the other cases, but I would not give up hope on receiving your due in 2021 just yet.\n\nThe Moneyist: I filed for bankruptcy after rehabbing my husband's home. Now he wants an open marriage and says I own nothing. I feel trapped and bamboozled\n\nPrevious letters have included financial abuse: This husband actually took the economic stimulus payment from his wife, a classic case of financial abuse where the abuser controls all the finances to maintain the power over his or her spouse in the relationship.\n\nIn another such case, this former wife forged her husband's signature on an IRS tax form (a classic case of old-fashioned fraud) and one that could be punishable with a custodial sentence, if it could be proven that she acted maliciously and/or with criminal intent.\n\nIn the hat-trick of skulduggery of The Moneyist's archive, this ex-wife dipped into her former husband's bank account and helped herself to his stimulus payment (a classic case of sharp practice, given that she had every right to withdraw money from a joint account).\n\nYour case highlights the importance of filing a tax return with the IRS and keeping track of bank accounts. You can make a note of your husband's refusal to hand this over during any future divorce proceedings. A judge is unlikely to look kindly on such stingy stimulus shenanigans.\n\nHello there, MarketWatchers.

You can check a task off your list and feel more organized and safer. A lost or stolen wallet holding too much personal and financial information puts you at risk of identity theft and fraud.\n\nExperts don't always agree on what you absolutely must keep in your wallet, but there's wide agreement on cards that do not belong there. It might be simplest to start the task by taking everything out and returning only those things you actually need.\n\nWhat to take out\n\nFocus on minimizing the danger that a stolen or lost wallet would put you at risk of identity theft. Here's what definitely should come out:\n\nSocial Security card.

Identity theft consultant and author Carrie Kerskie says Social Security cards can end up in wallets because they were put in for a specific purpose — say, when starting a new job — and just never removed. Receipts, passwords and other items may have gone in your wallet temporarily.\n\nIn addition, the AARP recommends you take out:\n\nMedicare and health insurance cards.

Those are the first things that you return to it when doing your clean-out:\n\nDriver's license or some other form of government-issued identification.\n\nStudent ID, if applicable.\n\nProof of auto insurance (could also be kept in your car's glove box).\n\nAt least two general-use credit cards if you have them.\n\nA medical alert card, if applicable.\n\nYou might like: Four travel credit card benefits you absolutely need in 2021\n\nWhat to carry only occasionally\n\nSome cards you need only sometimes, such as:\n\nMedical debit card for a flexible spending account.\n\nCredit cards for specific retailers.\n\nHealth, dental or prescription insurance cards.\n\nMembership cards.\n\nGift cards.\n\nThere's no time like a new year to establish new habits. Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the nonprofit Identity Theft Resource Center, recommends relying on tools you already use — phone alarms, calendars, journals or refrigerator notes — to remind you to add cards when needed and remove them afterward. For example, add a note saying take insurance and prescription cards to the reminder about your doctor appointment. Set a reminder to remove them, too.\n\nWhile there's no limit to how many credit cards you can have, there is a limit to how many you should carry, Kerskie says. If you carry 25, and one is stolen, how soon will you notice? Carrying just a few is safer and lets you use an autopay and everyday approach to reducing fraud risk.\n\nSee: 5 credit mistakes that can come back to bite you\n\nAvoid the dangerous workaround of taking photographs of all your cards, front and back, and storing them on your phone as photos, Kerskie says. If you want to store photos of your cards on your phone, put them in an encrypted, password-protected file.\n\nShould your phone be your wallet?\n\nEven identity theft experts differ on exactly which cards they carry, and in what format — physical or virtual wallet in a smartphone.\n\nI prefer tangible over digital any day, Kerskie says. You have a better chance of getting your phone stolen than your wallet. You could also leave your phone behind, or drop it or it malfunctions and stops working. Now, what do you do?\n\nVelasquez tends to favor digital, but that comes with a lot of habits to increase cybersecurity, including treating your phone as the small computer that it is:\n\nHaving a phone passcode of at least six digits.\n\nUpdating and backing up the device regularly.\n\nUsing antivirus software.\n\nSigning out of every app after use.\n\nNot using remember me when signing into apps and websites.\n\nUsing unique, complex passwords.\n\nHaving a remote wiping program in case it is lost or stolen.\n\nBut it's not for everyone. I have a high degree of confidence not just in the technology itself, but my ability to manage it properly, Velasquez says. I choose security over convenience.\n\nAlso on MarketWatch: The streaming services worth paying for in 2021\n\nIf that sounds just a little too inconvenient, you can simply be a good steward of your cards, taking them out of your wallet when they are not needed, she says.\n\nMore From NerdWallet\n\nBev O'Shea writes for NerdWallet.

Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, the beleaguered specialty pharmaceutical and medical device company, has a lot to do to reassure investors and the regulators before its executives sign its 2015 annual report.\n\nThe company's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, will have to do more, too, to check and double-check their numbers and the disclosures, before signing an opinion on those financial statements at the end of February.\n\nSo much has happened at Valeant US:VRX in the last year. As a result, PwC will almost definitely consider the company a high risk client, says J. Edward Ketz, an associate professor of accounting at Penn State University. Ketz says that means PwC's audit scope, level of effort and cost should be considerably higher this year. In 2014 the company paid PwC $12.6 million for its audit and an additional $3.5 million for tax services.\n\nValeant has seen its relationship with mail-order specialty pharmacy Philidor, one it didn't disclose for nearly a year, change dramatically from late 2014, when it purchased an option to buy the company, to the end of 2015, when it had completely severed all ties and shut down Philidor after the relationship was exposed.\n\nValeant would have been required to revise its revenue recognition and inventory accounting approaches regarding Philidor activity three times in the last 18 months. Initially, Valeant said it recognized revenue immediately when shipping to Philidor. Then after purchasing the option, it said it changed its approach and began to consolidate Philidor inventory on its balance sheet and delayed recognition of revenue until sales were made to final customers. Finally, Valeant would have reversed course again after announcing October 30 that the relationship with Philidor was finished.\n\nKetz says there has been no independent proof that Valeant ever actually accounted for Philidor revenue and inventory correctly, before or after it purchased the option to buy Philidor.\n\nValeant may have never implemented the correct approach before they ended the relationship. If I were PwC, I'd want to look very closely at this situation, he said.\n\nUnder Section 10A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, PwC is also required to independently investigate all of the allegations made by short sellers and others against Valeant regarding Philidor. The auditor must make its own determination whether anything illegal occurred and what the possible effect might be on the financial statements. PwC also must review the status of any internal investigation of the allegations against Valeant, and determine whether the audit committee and the rest of the board of directors have been adequately informed of any illegal acts.\n\nA spokeswoman for Valeant told MarketWatch that its ad hoc committee investigation into Philidor is ongoing.\n\nOn Dec. 30, Valeant announced that J. Michael Pearson, its chairman and CEO, had taken a leave of absence due to illness. The company on Wednesday announced that Howard Schiller, a board member and former chief financial officer, will be interim CEO — meaning that he will have to sign off on the annual report and confirm the company's internal controls, and represent that the financial statements do not contain any material untrue statements or material omissions or any information that could be considered misleading.\n\nAhead of Wednesday morning's announcement, Ketz said that the executive who agrees to sign as CEO will either have a lot of faith in CEO Pearson or will potentially ask to do his own due diligence before signing. Any additional work could delay Valeant's filing.\n\nValeant has previously been reluctant to disclose activities that it deemed immaterial. Its relationship with Philidor was left out of its disclosures for that reason, according to the company's defense against short seller allegations. However, investors certainly believed the relationship to be material when they sent the stock down 25% after Citron Research published a report highlighting the relationship and making other accounting fraud allegations.\n\nKetz says PwC will need its own independent legal team to make sure disclosures cover all required points and that none are misleading.\n\nWith regard to disclosures of legal contingencies and booking of reserves for possible litigation costs, there may be no situation that yet meets the required standards for disclosure or an expense, but that time may come during 2016, says Ketz.\n\nTom Selling, author of the blog Accounting Onion, says PwC will have to take into account everything that's happened to Valeant this year when it makes its annual going-concern assessment.\n\nIn mid-December, the company said results would be sharply lower than previously expected, largely because of the end of its relationship with Philidor. After congressional pressure, Valeant said it is changing its business strategy to become less dependent on drug price increases. There's quite a bit of uncertainty over future revenues and high debt, says Selling.\n\nYear Long-term debt due that year as of September 30, 2015 (in millions) 2016 $ 276.4 2018 3466.5 2019 1919.5 2020 8384.3 2021 3147.9 2022 4604.0 2023 5860.4 2025 3212.3\n\nValeant also faces much higher expenses for litigation and additional regulatory compliance efforts.\n\nA PwC spokeswoman declined to comment on its audit of Valeant.

Electric-car maker Tesla Inc. will cut approximately 7% of its full-time workforce and warned that Q4 profit won't meet the performance of Q3, CEO Elon Musk said in an update Friday.\n\nMusk said Tesla TSLA, -4.39% faces a tough challenge of making our cars, batteries and solar products cost-competitive with fossil fuels, and that the company's products are still too expensive for most people, according to the update on the company's blog that was emailed to all employees.\n\nShares of Tesla dropped nearly 8% in premarket trading. Shares are about flat in the last 12 months, versus losses of 6.5% for the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.16% in the same period.\n\nMusk said the 4% profit the company made in Q3 was due to sales of higher-priced Model 3 variants in North America. However, in Q4, preliminary, unaudited results indicate that we again made a GAAP profit, but less than Q3, he said. That Q3 profit surprised most analysts.\n\nThis quarter, as with Q3, shipment of higher-priced Model 3 variants (this time to Europe and Asia) will hopefully allow us, with great difficulty, effort and some luck, to target a tiny profit, he said.\n\nHigher volume and design improvements are crucial for Tesla to be able to sell the standard interior Model 3 at $35,000 as pledged and still be a viable company, he said. So far, the least-expensive version starts at $44,000 after Tesla lowered prices of all of its vehicles by $2,000 in early January. The federal tax credit that phases out this year, its expiration raising the ire of Musk, had helped make up the gap.\n\nRelated:Elon Musk kills the Tesla referral program, suggests it hurt margins\n\nMusk said the company will retain only the most critical temps and contractors, adding that the staffing changes will be made while boosting Model 3 production and making many manufacturing engineering improvements in the coming months.\n\nThe job cuts follow a 9% staff reduction in June.
Reinvesting dividends accounts for a big chunk of total stock-market returns over the long term, but chasing after high-yielding dividend stocks is one of the worst strategies an investor can pursue, especially in taxable accounts, according to Meb Faber, chief investment officer at Cambria Investment Management.\n\nOver the past several years, in an economic environment of slow growth and ultralow bond yields, investors hungry for income had allocated hundreds of billions of dollars to dividend strategies.\n\nRead:20 dividend stocks with yields up to 7.5%—and these companies are set for sales and earnings gains\n\nIn 2016, both quality and high-yield dividend stocks saw their valuations rise to the highest levels in years, diminishing prospects for long-term returns. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% hit record levels in 2016, ending the year with a 12% total return.\n\nRead: As yields rise, sun may be setting on dividend-ETF rally\n\nFaber, using data provided by Wesley Gray and Jack Vogle at Alpha Architects, came to the conclusion that the only reason high-dividend yield stocks outperform over the long term is because of their value status and not their dividends.\n\nOne of the reasons a stock can have a high dividend yield is due to a sharp decline in its price, rendering it cheap or value. This is the reason why many high dividend yield stocks are also value stocks, due to their cheapness. However, not all cheap stocks represent value. Sometimes, cheap stocks are cheap for a reason, such as an impending bankruptcy.\n\nHistorically, dividend stocks outperformed the market because they have a value tilt. In the same context, historically, value stocks outperformed dividend stocks. But focusing on dividend yields rather than value has been a suboptimal way to express value, Faber said.\n\nIf you have to focus on dividends, you must include a valuation screen or process to avoid high yielding but expensive, junky stocks, he added.\n\nAnother issue with dividend stocks is that they are considered capital gains and taxed as such unless investors own them in their retirement or tax-exempt accounts.\n\nIn a table below, Faber compared top 100 high-yield dividend stocks to cap weighted and equal weighted portfolios of the largest 2,000 stocks. Dividend stocks only outperformed in a tax-free environment.\n\nMeb Faber, Cambria; Wesley Gray, Jack Vogle at Alpha Architects\n\nBut by excluding dividend stocks from value stocks investors with taxable accounts could enhance their returns further by 0.3 - 4.5 percentage points, according to Faber.\n\nMeb Faber, Cambria; Wesley Gray, Jack Vogle at Alpha Architects\n\nThe biggest takeaway is that over the past 40 years, an equal-weighted portfolio of 2,000 stocks beat a cap-weighted portfolio as well as a top dividend-yield portfolio in all taxable accounts.\n\nBut top value stocks trumped all—as long as you held on to your stocks in bad as well as good years.\n\nRead:Value stocks—and patience — may be the only way to turn around bleak returns
Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren has been concerned about a potential asset bubble in commercial real estate since late 2015. And he says that the problem of asset prices has gotten worse, not better.\n\nFor a while, real estate looked like the only asset class that was showing signs of having substantial variation from what the average valuation had been, but I think we're starting to see more asset markets have that characteristic, he says.\n\nThis makes life hard for the central bank. For instance, it makes it more difficult for the central bank to engineer a soft landing for the economy, Rosengren said. It also means the Fed cannot pause in its gradual pace of rate hikes and should even pick up the pace a bit this year. The U.S. central bank might have to raise rates four times in 2018, he said, more than the median forecast of Fed officials or the two hikes the market expects.\n\nMarketWatch spoke with Rosengren as he was preparing to give his first speech of the year on the economic outlook. In his remarks, he said low inflation has so far allowed the Fed to pursue very gradual rate hikes.\n\nHere's the edited interview.\n\nMarketWatch: Asset valuations have continued to rise after you last voiced concern last year. What's your latest view?\n\nRosengren: Nothing has changed dramatically, prices are still edging up, so valuation concerns are still there. I would say what has changed a little bit is, for a while, real estate looked like the only asset class that was showing signs of having substantial variation from what the average valuation had been, but I think we're starting to see more asset markets have that characteristic.\n\nEconomists are not very good at predicting how large deviations will be. And there are some underlying reasons for why you might see valuation differences. One would be that if you really think we're in a low-interest-rate environment. That means valuations, will, on average, be higher. So the question is, do you think that is a permanent phenomenon or a temporary phenomenon? And obviously when you are talking about stocks, but also to some extent commercial real estate, the tax code matters, and we've just had a tax code change. So those kinds of effects can have an impact on valuation. But I would say that real estate, like other asset classes, are now showing to be a bit higher than what they've been historically and that continues to be a little bit of a concern for me.\n\nMarketWatch: The Fed's rate hikes to date haven't tightened financial conditions at all.\n\nRosengren: That's accurate. Financial conditions have not tightened significantly with the increase in short-term interest rates. Part of that is the stock market has gone up quite a bit and exchange rates and some of these other variables are being affected by a stimulative fiscal policy. So even while we're tightening with monetary policy, in some sense we have a more stimulative fiscal policy and over the course of the year people didn't know what, if any, tax change would occur. And now we know a tax change has actually occurred, so we now have a stimulative environment from the fiscal policy side that we didn't necessarily know was going to happen, so short-term interest rates have tightened but the long rate TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.402% is a little less than 2.5% right now. I would expect over time that it will gradually increase as we unwind our balance sheet and as it becomes clear that inflation really is picking up towards our 2% goal and that the tight labor markets are starting to have an impact on wages and prices over time.\n\nMarketWatch: Do you think the Fed should raise rates at a faster pace than gradual?\n\nRosengren: The [Fed forecasts] in December had three tightenings. I actually think we'll probably need a little bit more than that. I'm hopeful that we can continue to do it gradually. Doing it gradually probably requires us to continue to be doing it though. So if we were to slow down for some reason, I would be worried that at some point we would have to start moving more quickly. I would be worried about moving quickly at a time when asset prices were already at very high valuations. I think being able to do it more leisurely is one reason why we haven't had as much of a slowdown and probably has reduced the probability of having a recession. In addition, fiscal policy being so stimulative is a period where you wouldn't expect an economic downturn either.\n\nMarketWatch: Is the Fed, in a sense, going to keep raising rates until it sees a tightening of financial conditions?\n\nRosengren: No, I wouldn't phrase it that way. Our dual mandate goal would be that we have to get to 2% inflation and get to what we believe is a sustainable unemployment rate. The unemployment rate right now is at 4.1% so we're already lower than where we think we need to be. My own view is what the sustainable unemployment rate would be more like 4.7%. If you look at the Blue Chip forecasts, which just came out, they are actually getting it down to 3.7% in 2019. So we are actually moving in the opposite direction. I do think that we have to gradually tighten and I don't want to overshoot on the unemployment rate so much that it becomes very difficult to get back to a sustainable unemployment rate without having a recession.\n\nAnd I would put financial conditions – that is not a goal of monetary policy – but it makes it harder to start tightening if you have to do a lot of tightening, and if you really have to slow down the economy. If you think that potential GDP is growing around 1.75%, well if you want to get the unemployment rate to gradually go up, you are going to have to be seeing some 1.5% [GDP prints] and some lower numbers than we've been seeing. When we see those numbers it is possible that you get more of a slowdown than you're anticipating, and that can be particularly true, I think, if financial markets are a little bit too ebullient. So I think financial conditions and financial stability issues complement some of the concerns I would have about whether we're getting to an unsustainable level of unemployment rate over time.\n\nMarketWatch: Some colleagues want the pace of rate hikes to slow down – and point to the flattening of the yield curve as a signal to go slow.\n\nRosengren: We've intentionally pushed long-term rates down by having a big balance sheet. We've chosen a path which will not disrupt financial markets which means that our balance sheet comes down quite slowly. Until we have more normalized the balance sheet, it is not surprising that long rates are lower than they otherwise would be and it is not just what the U.S. is doing, it is what Japan and Europe are doing. So they are still expanding their balance sheets, even though we've been pulling back, and so that also is pushing down long-term rates as well.\n\nIt isn't surprising to me that we're tightening up at the short-end but the fact that monetary policy both here and abroad has been pushing down on the long rate means that this is going to be a little bit different exit strategy than what we've historically seen. We haven't had a bloated balance sheet around the world in previous periods. People who are taking a lot of meaning from the slope of the yield curve, I think, need to consider what it means to be in a different monetary policy framework — which is that Europe, Japan and the United States have a balance sheet that intentionally was suppressing long rates. So the signal value probably isn't quite the same, but it is a reason to your earlier question about why financial conditions haven't tightened more because the balance sheets are likely to only come down gradually over time. Now you could do it differently, and if you want to see the long end of the market go up quickly I can certainly imagine policies of central banks in some part of the world deciding to sell long-term securities would have the impact of pushing up the yield curve. I'm not advocating that. But I think it is an intentional policy. It is not as if this is an unanticipated outcome.\n\nMarketWatch: And you think that inflation will move higher?\n\nRosengren: Just having the data from the spring time roll off – we had the wireless prices changes, there were a couple other changes in prices that I think were tied to individual markets that really were not tied to overall inflation and so I think once we get to the spring time we're going to be seeing numbers much closer to 2%. In addition, we have pretty tight labor markets already, and if we continue to grow faster than potential, those labor markets are going to get even tighter. If we start seeing unemployment rates below 4%, that's a pretty tight labor market. You're already hearing lots of stories, I think, in some of the tight markets about the difficulty of getting labor and one way to respond to that is to offer higher wages to try to attract people either in the local market or from outside the local market. These things take time. They don't happen overnight. That's why there are long and variable lags in monetary policy. I do expect that over time it will have that impact. We'll see more wage pressures and we'll see with time more inflation.\n\nMarketWatch: There has been a lot of discussion in recent weeks about a new framework for monetary policy. Where do you stand?\n\nRosengren: I think there are some advantages of having a Fed-led discussion about how we should think about the framework. My own view is that we would be better off having a little more flexibility than having a specific inflation target. I would much rather have an inflation range – something more like 1.5%-3%. And that during times where interest rates were likely to be low because labor force growth was quite low and productivity was quite low, that would be a time that I would actually like a higher level of inflation so I would like to be higher in the range during that period. And during periods of very high productivity then we could be lower. And the reason for that is – and it is partly a financial stability concern – that the current framework where we have low productivity and low population growth and not much immigration, is an environment where we are going to hit the zero lower bound too frequently. And I do think that has significant consequences – both because monetary policy becomes less effective when we can't move short-term interest rates, and I also think that it changes investor and household behavior when you start having periods of prolonged interest rates that are very low and unchanged. So I would like to avoid those kind of outcomes occurring in future recessions and so I think it is a good time to be discussing what is the right framework to reduce that probability. Inflation would still be, I think, in a range that it wouldn't be affecting decision-making by households or firms but would give you a little more flexibility to reduce the probability that you hit zero during recessions. So if we were to have a recession right now, most recessions we move interest rates by much more than 300 basis points. If you look at where the [Fed forecasts] in December had the fed funds in the long run, [2.8%] it is low enough that more than likely in most recessions we'd hit zero. That is a concern.
The wit and wisdom of Charlie Munger, the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, is legendary in the investment world. Here are five of my favorite Mungerisms and what I learned from them:\n\n'The desire to get rich fast is pretty dangerous.'\n\nEarly in my life, Munger taught me that trying to get rich fast is dangerous. One has to gamble on the short-term price swings of some stock, derivatives contract, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% , the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% or other asset. A huge number of people are trying to do the same thing, many of them who are much better informed than I am, and the short-term price movement of any stock or derivative contract is subject to all kinds of wild price gyrations due to events that have nothing to do with the actual long-term value of the underlying business. And last, but not least, there is the problem of leverage — to get rich quickly one often has to use leverage/debt to amplify small price swings into really huge gains. If things go against us, can also turn into really large loses.\n\nSo we take a leveraged position in a stock, thinking we are going to hit it big, something terrible like the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks happen, the stock market tanks, and we get wiped out. This is why Munger and Warren Buffett, Berkshire's BRK.A, +0.53% BRK.B, +0.18% chairman and CEO, avoid using leverage and only bets on the long-term economics of the business, and not the short-term price swings of its stock price.\n\n'Knowing what you don't know is more useful than being brilliant.'\n\nMunger helped me become aware that I needed to more conscious of what I don't know, and then use that knowledge to stay away from businesses that sell services and products I am clueless about.\n\nAn excellent example of this bit of Munger wisdom in action was during the height of the bull market bubble in technology stocks during the late 1990s, when many brilliant investors were busy buying the hot internet stocks of the day. Munger knew he didn't understand these new internet businesses — so he and Berkshire Hathaway avoided them completely. Most of Wall Street thought he had lost his touch. But when the internet stock bubble finally burst, and many fortunes were lost, and it was Munger who looked brilliant.\n\n'People are trying to be smart. All I am trying to do is not to be idiotic, but it's harder than most people think.'\n\nIt took me a while to really get a grip on this bit of Munger wisdom. It is predicated on the theory that a shortsighted stock market will sometimes underprice a company's shares relative to the long-term economic value of the company. When that happens, Munger buys into the company and holds it for the long term, letting the underlying economics of the business eventually lift the stock price.\n\nThe only thing Munger has to be careful about is not doing something stupid, which in his case is mostly errors of omission, like not acting when he sees an investment, or buying too little of it when the opportunity presents itself. I have found that is actually harder to do than one might think.\n\n'Sit on your ass investing. You're paying less to brokers, you're listening to less nonsense, and if it works, the tax system gives you an extra one, two, or three percentage points per annum.'\n\nMunger's sitting on your ass investing strategy argues one will make more money buying into a business with exceptional business economics working in its favor and holding it for many years, than engaging in a lot of buying and selling trying to anticipate stock market moves. Munger argues that the constant buying and selling means constantly being taxed. If one had the patience to hold the investment for 20 years, there would be only one tax to pay, which according to Munger, equates to an extra one to three extra percentage point a year.\n\nWhile the three extra percentage points may not seem like much, consider this: a $1 million investment compounding at 4% a year will have grown in year 20 to $2,191,123. Add three percentage points so that the million-dollar investment is compounding for 20 years at 7%, and we end up with $3,869,684.\n\nAccording to Munger, time is on the side of the business that has exceptional economics working in its favor, but for the mediocre business, time is a curse.\n\n'My idea of shooting a fish in a barrel is draining the barrel first.'\n\nMunger made it clear to me that sometimes the shortsighted stock market serves up an investment opportunity that is so obvious it is hard not to trip over it. This usually happens when investors are panicking and fleeing any and all investments, even the ones with great long-term economics. This flight is the draining of the barrel: Stock prices sink, which makes it easier for Munger to see the fish, in this case underpriced great businesses.\n\nAlso read:Charlie Munger and Donald Trump agree in these 3 ways\n\nDavid Clark is an investor, attorney and the co-author of eight books on Warren Buffett.

Hello,\n\nI've been working since my senior year in high school and have finally hit the $1 million mark at the age of 55. I probably could have doubled that amount had I chosen to invest wisely. Instead, I banked about 70% of my savings in CDs and other low interest-bearing safe havens. So, now I've currently got about $700,000 in CDs earning a paltry 1%. I do however have the other 30% invested in higher-yielding index funds.\n\nLike so many others, I want to retire and get off the merry-go-round of unfulfilling, soul-crushing jobs. I have never purchased a home. I also don't have any debt, nor do I have any kids or a spouse. As someone who lives a minimalist lifestyle, I can probably get by on about $3,000 a month. Is there a comfortable path I can take to get there if I leave the workforce today? I'm currently in good health, but there is a history of heart disease in the family, so I'll be lucky to reach my 80s.\n\nReady for a new chapter today!\n\nSee: I'm 63, unemployed since March, and have $220,000 in retirement savings — should I claim Social Security early?\n\nDear reader,\n\nSaving $1 million — no matter what type of accounts that money is in — is such an accomplishment, so congratulations.\n\nYou're right to say that investing these assets in something other than CDs would possibly have gotten you more money, but there's still time to make sound financial decisions. Sticking to low-interest accounts may feel comfortable, but you could actually be losing out on money in the future if these accounts do not keep up with inflation. The same can be said for housing — rent prices may fluctuate and rise much faster than your income, said Nadine Burns, president and chief executive officer of A New Path Financial.\n\nBelieve it or not, a retirement in the near future is feasible, some financial advisers said. How much money someone needs to accumulate before retiring depends greatly on the individual's circumstances and numerous factors. If you expect a shorter life expectancy and can live off $3,000 a month, you'd be right under the typical 4% withdrawal rate, said Kristin Sullivan, a financial adviser at Sullivan Financial Planning. He could likely withdraw more in the early retirement years knowing his withdrawals would drop quite a bit when Social Security kicks in, she said.\n\nYour $3,000 estimate would have to include taxes and exclude Social Security projections, though, said Rob Greenman, lead adviser and partner of Vista Capital Partners. When you factor in Social Security income kicking in 10 to 15 years from now for this person, they should be able to live on that burn rate for 40 years or so, he said.\n\nA key component to these calculations is life expectancy. Although you think you will not live well into your 80s, the truth of the matter is you simply don't know. There are many people in their 50s that believe they will live a full retirement until 80+ then magically drop dead, Burns said. Even if you don't believe you may personally live to be 90 or 100, you should plan as if you will. One of the greatest fears older Americans have is running out of money, and you don't want your future self to regret not putting enough thought into that possibility.\n\nThink about a few hurdles you might have to jump if you retire too soon. This includes what kind of health care coverage you will have between now and age 65, when you qualify for Medicare; when you would start claiming Social Security; and the tax and potential penalties associated with withdrawals from your accounts. Qualified retirement plans, like 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts, have special rules associated with withdrawals before age 59 ½ (though there is a 401(k) rule for people 55 or older who were separated from their jobs).\n\nDon't miss: This early retiree found her calling during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nHealth care can be a major challenge for early retirees, especially with no spouse who could have perhaps claimed you as a dependent on his or her plan. Health insurance can be expensive, especially when not tied to an employer's plan, and eventually, medical expenses will be a large portion of your monthly costs. This can be one of a retiree's biggest expenses and may compromise the reader's $3,000 monthly budget, said Brian Behl, founder of Behl Wealth.\n\nEarlier I mentioned the risks associated with keeping your money in low-interest and safe investments. Before retiring, you should take a hard look at your investment strategies. Another key factor in how long your $1 million lasts is your portfolio's diversification.\n\nAn individual cannot retire on $1 million if they plan to keep 70% of their funds in low-interest (no interest nowadays) accounts, said Thomas Balcom, founder of 1650 Wealth Management, who recommends having 20% to 25% in bond funds or cash positions and the remainder in a diversified portfolio of stock mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and/or market linked notes. These investments will provide him with the potential to grow his portfolio to account for inflation during his retirement years.\n\nYou may want to look for a financial planner to help you create a financial plan and allocate your assets appropriately for your age, risk tolerance and goals.\n\nAs for Social Security: choosing to leave the workforce will cut into your benefits later in life, said David Haas, owner of Cereus Financial Advisors. The Social Security Administration factors in your wages over your career, using the highest income years to figure out your benefit — this means you could be losing out on a potentially higher benefit by leaving early too.\n\nThat being said, if you still choose to leave the workforce soon, think about when you would start to claim Social Security. When you do, the amount of money you'll be taking out of your savings will decrease — prolonging the lifespan of these accounts — but you may want to delay the benefits as long as possible so that you get as much as you can. If you wait until after your Full Retirement Age, which is around age 67, you'll get more than your Primary Insurance Amount.\n\nAlso see: I'm an upper-middle-class 'loner' entering the 'home stretch of my life' — who will manage my last wishes?\n\nAlong with the financial considerations, think about the non-money aspects that make up retirement. I know you said you're tired of unfulfilling, soul-crushing jobs, but switching from work to no clear plan for what to do with your days could be disastrous for your mental and emotional well-being. Not everyone has a clear vision for their retirement, but now would be the time to make a list of some possible paths. This could be volunteer work, or more time with the family, or perhaps the type of job that brings in significantly less money but also makes you happier.\n\nMy advice is to examine why he wants to retire, Haas said. Maybe there is something he always wanted to do that is different from his current job. Instead of retiring, use his nest egg to finance a second career in something he might really want to do. This would also give you more time to pay into Social Security, add more money to your savings and have health insurance covered.\n\nTransitions can be hard — whether the retiree is at a traditional age, such as around 65, or earlier, like in their 50s or even 40s. Many people are taking early retirement more seriously — there's a whole movement for it, called FIRE, short for financial independence, retire early — but there are hard lessons that come with this freedom, such as a loss of identity from leaving the workforce or an unbearable amount of free time.\n\nYou have worked hard for nearly four decades, so it makes perfect sense why you'd like to take this next step into retirement. Having $1 million saved is an incredible feat as is having no debt. But while you may want to jump into retirement because of these impressive achievements, make sure you think carefully about this decision and all of the possibilities attached so that you are truly comfortable for the coming decades.\n\nHave a question about your own retirement savings?

Treasury prices pared modest gains Wednesday, leaving yields slightly lower, after minutes of the Federal Reserve's December policy meeting highlighted some division over the central bank's forecast for three rate increases in 2018.\n\nThe 2-year note yield TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.149% , which is the most sensitive to shifts in interest-rate expectations, edged up 1.2 basis point to 1.935%. The short bond has been up 12 of the past 16 trading sessions, according to WSJ Market Data Group.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.682% fell 2 basis points to 2.445%. The yield of the benchmark bond has been down four of the past six trading sessions.\n\nThe 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.402% slipped 2.9 basis points to 2.782%, and has fallen in six of the past eight trading days.\n\nBond prices move inversely to yields.\n\nWhat's driving the market?\n\nThe minutes unveiled two camps, both uncomfortable with the Fed's December forecast of three rate increases in 2018—with one faction worried the pace might be too aggressive, while another feared it would be too slow.\n\nRead:Fed minutes show divide over forecast of three rate hikes this year\n\nAccording to CME Group data, market participants are expecting the next rate increase, after the Fed's recent quarter-percentage point increase to a range between 1.25% and 1.5%, to occur in March.\n\nWhat has been viewed as muted moves in Treasury yields come as the dollar, as gauged by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.13% , has been near its lows for September at 92.07, despite tax-cut legislation and other fiscal stimulus measures which were expected to boost the buck. The dollar regained some ground on Wednesday, extending gains in the wake of the minutes.\n\nTraders also focused on geopolitics, as thousands of people took to the streets of Iran on Wednesday, voicing support for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, following what has been the largest wave of antigovernment unrest in almost a decade.\n\nMeanwhile, North Korea reopened communications with its neighbor the South, highlighting signs of relaxed tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nWhat does the data show?\n\nThe December Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index came in at 59.7%, up from 58.2% in November and marking the strongest year for the activity gauge since 2004, according to FactSet. A figure above 50% indicates activity is expanding.\n\nThe Commerce Department said construction spending rose 0.8% in November, surpassing expectations for a 0.5% rise.\n\nWhat are strategists saying?\n\nThe December ISM reading is the thin air of the high peaks, wrote Wells Fargo economists John Silvia and Tim Quinlan, in a note. It is quite uncommon for the ISM index to remain so firmly in expansion territory for such a long period. The only other time in the past 40 years that the ISM came in at 58 or higher for this many consecutive months was a streak that lasted from November 2003 to August 2004.\n\nOverall, Fed officials re-affirmed at this meeting that they anticipate raising interest rates three times in 2018, matching the tightening in 2017, but we still anticipate that a slightly faster than expected rebound in core inflation will mean we eventually see four rate hikes in 2018, said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in a Wednesday note following the release of minutes.\n\nWhat other assets are in focus?
In one of the last interviews he gave before his death Wednesday, Jack Bogle was heard telling investors to play it safe.\n\nThere was no sky-is-falling talk from the godfather of low-cost index funds, but his advice to get in your comfort zone over stock exposure interview was prudent, given that it came just days after a holiday meltdown for stocks.\n\nOpinion:Jack Bogle gave individual investors the power to triumph over Wall Street\n\nHe also mentioned clouds on the horizon, with trade tensions among them, and that old saw is threatening to make a mess of the action Thursday. Reports U.S. feds are probing Huawei over alleged stolen tech secrets have forced some cheer out of the building, with the safe-haven yen USDJPY, +0.08% seeing some duck-for-cover action.\n\nAs well, there may be just too much idle market time between Morgan Stanley results and Netflix after the bell today.\n\nBack to Bogle, who haunts our call of the day from Andrew Lapthorne on Société GLE, -0.94% quantitative analysis team. The analyst warns that U.S. small-caps will be in the eye of the next storm for stocks, owing to the huge amount of debt they've been racking up for years. Corporate debt was another horizontal cloud mentioned by the Bogle.\n\nBanks like SocGen have been banging the table on this one, Lapthorne said in a phone interview, adding that he's personally had the subject on the radar for four years. His fresh warning came up in a recent presentation to clients given by he and the bank's uber-bearish strategist Albert Edwards. In a clutch of charts, they rolled out this one showing a huge ramp-up in debt for the small-cap focused Russell 2000 RUT, -1.72% :\n\nSmall-caps have traditionally acted as a canary in the coal mine for the larger market, as they tend to be more sensitive to growth worries and usually show signs of fatigue before their big-cap counterparts.\n\nU.S. small-caps have been taking on a massive amount of leverage over the last few years, particularly starting in 2013 during the QE years, notes Lapthorne.\n\nPeople focusing on buybacks were missing the fact that actually a lot of [companies] buying back significant market cap was going on in the small cap-index. The highly unusual reason that was happening is because people were having to lend to real businesses, he said.\n\nRead:Head of world's largest asset manager says stock market has hit a bottom — but this would make it surge\n\nSo, the difference between where we are now versus 12 months ago, says Lapthorne, is that share prices have been losing ground, and if you have leverage and your share price is weak, that compounds the problem. On a 12-month basis, the Russell 2000 has lost nearly 8% against a 5.7% drop for the S&P 500.\n\nAnd a small company with balance-sheet problems can't do what the big boys do — go back to markets and do a rights issue. That ultimately leads to a higher bankruptcy risk and bigger risks for the economy, which gets harder to ignore. Looking at the Fed's reversal in policy it seems far more connected to what's going on in credit markets and in terms of weakening companies, he said.\n\nLapthorne says it doesn't make sense that investors focus on bigger companies when it comes to looking for red flags for the overall market. If you think about it, the S&P 500 contains some of the richest, best companies in the world, so why would you look to the richest companies in the world for signs of stress? You're far better off looking at the poorest companies.\n\nHe also worries that investors are on a path of companies that are going to really struggle owing to big deterioration in profit growth, which is now seeing the effects of a tax-induce surge of a year ago start to fade.\n\nHere's one last chart from SocGen that taps into another worry on the radar for investors — a recession threat. It shows that one in four U.S. stocks have 50% or more of their value erased in a recession:\n\nGulp.\n\nRead: Why stock-market investors may soon need to worry about the government shutdown\n\nThe market\n\nThe Dow DJIA, -0.39% , S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% and Nasdaq COMP, +0.09% have all opened on the downside.\n\nAs global equities dip, crude US:CLU8 is getting knocked, while the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.04% is flat, gold US:GCU8 is steady.\n\nWeak results from Morgan Stanley MS, -1.57% and SocGen have hit Europe stocks SXXP, +0.88% , while trade jitters dragged Asia stocks south HSI, -0.15% .\n\nThe chart\n\nHow can you resist stocks right now?

With Donald Trump's inauguration a day away, investors are scrambling to ensure that their portfolios are best positioned to thrive under what's expected to be the incoming administration's new economic policies. While banks and industrial companies have been particular trading favorites, Goldman Sachs is looking less at industries and more at how companies spend their money.\n\nThe firm's advice: Buy companies that don't spend a lot on salaries, and which pay a lot in taxes.\n\nBoth qualities, the investment bank wrote in a note to clients published late Wednesday, are poised to outperform in the economic environment, with the former avoiding a cost as wages rise, while the latter has the most to gain from the massive tax cuts Trump is expected to pursue.\n\nSee also: How David Einhorn's hedge fund is positioning for a Trump presidency\n\nTrump has proposed cutting the corporate tax rate from 35% to 15%, and stocks with the highest effective tax rates will be the clearest beneficiaries of any potential tax reform, wrote the team of analysts, who were led by David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist.\n\nThe investment bank created a basket of securities with higher tax rates, the median stock of which had a 10-year median rate of 38%, compared with 31% for the median component of the S&P 500. Thus far this year, the basket is up 2.1%, above the 1.4% rise of the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% , according to data provided by Goldman.\n\nSee also: How stocks perform in president's first 100 days — in one chart\n\nTechnology shares were the most represented sector in the basket, comprising 22% of the holdings. Alliance Data Systems ADS, -2.67% and F5 Networks Inc. FFIV, -0.54% were among the biggest tech components; both pay a tax rate around 37%.\n\nTrump's potential conflicts of interest around the world\n\nWhile energy stocks made up a smaller portion of the basket—at 8%—the sector could see the biggest impact from this thesis, as it boasts the highest tax rates of any sector, with a median of 37%.\n\nGoldman's thesis on labor costs comes as wages growth has surged to a seven-year high, creating an environment that is good for workers, but which may erode a stock's margins. The median stock in the investment bank's low labor costs pays an implied 3% of its sales in labor costs, under the 11% median of the S&P 500. The basket is up 1.7% year-to-date.\n\nTechnology companies, which tend to have fewer employees than other industries, were again the most heavily weighted sector in the basket, comprising 26% of the total. The components include Apple Inc. AAPL, -3.39% , Skyworks Solutions Inc. SWKS, -4.44% , and Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, -3.11% . The implied labor cost of Apple, as a percentage of its total revenue, is 2%, while it is under 1% for the others.\n\nGoldman also recommended investors buy stocks that have a high degree of domestic sales, which it said should benefit from a strengthening U.S. dollar, fiscal stimulus, and protectionist trade policies. This has already been a popular trade, with investors taking to small-cap stocks in the wake of the election. Typically, smaller companies have a higher degree of domestic sales than their larger multinational peers.
Netflix Inc.'s stock NFLX, -3.75% rallied 0.9% in premarket trade Friday, after Deutsche Bank upgraded the streaming video service, citing expectations that Netflix will report better-than-expected results next week. Analyst Bryan Kraft raised his rating to hold, three months after starting coverage with a sell rating. He raised his stock price target to $110, but that was still 15% below Thursday's closing price of $129.18, from $92. Kraft said when he initiated coverage of Netflix, he believed the company had an attractive business model, but the stock was priced two years ahead of the fundamentals, and that a sale of the company was highly unlikely. His new rating and price target is based on a higher subscriber trajectory internationally, a lower tax rate and the believe that fourth-quarter results will beat guidance for international subscribers. The key driver of the stock price around earnings reports has predominantly been subscribers, Kraft wrote in a note to clients. Netflix is scheduled to report results after the market closes on Jan. 18. The stock has run up 29% over the past three months, while the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% has gained 6.5%.
When Rep. Chris Collins was charged in August with insider trading, it sparked a push to bar House members from serving on the boards of publicly traded companies.\n\nA ban could come shortly, thanks to a rules package proposed by House Democrats as they prepare to take control of the chamber on Thursday.\n\nThe rules changes would close the conflict of interest loophole by prohibiting representatives and their staff from sitting on corporate boards, said Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, and Rep. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat and incoming chairman of the House's rules committee, in a statement on the proposed package. The two lawmakers said their rules package will be introduced and voted on this week.\n\nCollins has been accused of insider trading with family members who were holding the stock of an Australian biotech company on whose board he was serving. The New York Republican, who has pleaded not guilty, is no longer on the board of directors for this biotech, which was named Innate Immunotherapeutics but is now called Amplia Therapeutics INNMF, -18.75% .\n\nAfter Collins was hit with charges, Pelosi called for tougher ethics measures, saying his indictment and arrest show the rampant culture of corruption and self-enrichment among Republicans in Washington today.\n\nIt's difficult to know how many House members may have had board positions like Collins, because while lawmakers file financial disclosure reports, there's no central database where that information is available, a recent Associated Press report noted. Senators are already barred from sitting on boards of publicly traded companies.\n\nThe trial for Collins, who was re-elected in November despite the federal indictment in August, is slated to begin in February 2020. The Securities and Exchange Commission has accused Collins of passing on nonpublic information about unexpectedly poor drug-trial results for Innate to his son and the father of his son's girlfriend.\n\nHouse Democrats' rules package for the Congress that convenes Thursday also contains what's known as a pay-as-you-go provision, which would require new spending to be offset with either tax increases or budget cuts. A few Democrats have slammed this provision. Other features of the package include reviving the so-called Gephardt Rule, which automatically increases the debt ceiling.
ZURICH — UBS Group AG eked out a fourth-quarter net profit because of a tax benefit that helped counter earnings pressure on the Swiss bank's flagship wealth-management unit.\n\nZurich-based UBS UBSG, +3.96% UBS, +3.02% said Tuesday that net income in the three months to the end of December rose to 949 million Swiss francs ($931.5 million) from 858 million francs in the same quarter last year. UBS had originally posted year-earlier net profit for the year-earlier fourth-quarter of 963 million francs. However, that figure was subsequently lowered by the bank as part of its organizational changes, restatements and accounting adjustments.\n\nThe bank's shares were down 8.5% early Tuesday.\n\nUBS has been applying losses incurred during the financial crisis to its recent financial results, receiving a reduction in tax liabilities that has boosted its quarterly profit. Its net tax benefit for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 715 million francs, UBS said.\n\nThat helped to dull the pain of what was a difficult period.\n\nThe last quarter of 2015 was the most challenging we've experienced in several years, Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti told analysts. He said the bank's clients remain risk-averse and inclined to park their money in the form of cash. Cash helps them sleep better at night, Ermotti said.\n\nUBS said adjusted pretax profit at its flagship wealth-management business fell by 193 million francs to 505 million francs in the quarter, with net outflows of 3.4 billion francs. The bank cited very low levels of client activity. Outflows were heaviest among European clients and those in emerging markets, UBS said.\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com\n\nInvesting Insights: A global markets survival guide\n\nIf you'll be in London on Tuesday, Feb. 23, you're invited to join us for an evening of cocktails and conversation on the topics of shifting monetary policy, growth, currencies, and the outlook for investing opportunities and risks in European and global markets.\n\nOur panelists for the evening will include MarketWatch Personal Finance and Investing Columnist Robert Powell; Mark Hulbert, Editor of the Hulbert Financial Digest; and Virginie Maisonneuve, Founder and Managing Director of Maisonneuve Global Advisors.\n\nThe event is free and open to the public, but reservations are required.

On the first day of this year, tech executive and author David Bressler had a note on his calendar to start contributing more to his retirement accounts.\n\nBressler is turning 50 later this year but he's already capitalizing on what experts say is one of the most important things 50-somethings can do for their retirement savings: catch up.\n\nEven the industry demonstrates this — employer-sponsored retirement accounts and individual retirement accounts have catch-up contributions, which allow investors to put away more money in their accounts beginning the year that investor turns 50.\n\nYou have to do what you can to plan for the future, Bressler said. You always have to be squirreling away.\n\nMany 50-somethings are at the crossroads of their lives — between big life events that may have already occurred, such as buying a home and getting married, and the children they raised are becoming financially independent, also known as empty nesting. When expenses start to dwindle is the perfect time for 50-somethings to start ramping up their retirement savings, especially if they don't have much in those accounts. By your 50s, you should have saved four or five times your annual salary, though those in their 50s have an estimated median savings of about $117,000, according to a 2015 Government Accountability Office analysis. Unfortunately, some people just can't afford to retire yet.\n\nSee:The 7 elements of a successful retirement\n\nWhat to do in your 50s to build wealth for your retirement\n\nCatching up doesn't have to be overwhelming — whether you have kids or not, expenses can be downsized, which would allow the average 50-something to put more money away for their retirement. Some people choose to move to a smaller home, or rent, to alleviate paying off a mortgage for a home too large and perhaps not fully used. Buying a smaller home could also save on taxes, utility costs and insurance, according to business forecasts publishing company Kiplinger.\n\nOf course, there are tools within retirement accounts that allow investors to save more. Employer-sponsored retirement accounts, such as 401(k) and 403(b) plans, allow employees age 50 and older to contribute $6,000 more in their accounts, on top of the $18,500 maximum per year. SIMPLE 401(k) plans have a maximum contribution is $12,500 with a $3,000 catch-up contribution limit. Traditional and Roth IRAs have a maximum contribution of $5,500, and allow $1,000 more in catch-up contributions. (Roth IRAs also have income limits.) Consider the differences between pre-tax and after-tax accounts, said Melissa Sotudeh, a financial adviser at Halpern Financial in Rockville, Md., since tax-deferred plans' assets will draw down faster than after-tax plans because withdrawals will be taxed.\n\nSome 50-somethings may want to start by evaluating what they already have saved, according to New York-based robo-adviser Betterment. This includes looking over what accounts you already have (and possibly consolidate numerous accounts) and checking your portfolios' asset allocations. General advice is to lean toward bonds instead of stocks as you get older, since they're less risky, but some experts, such as Henry Hebeler, who assists people with retirement planning, might suggest keeping a fair mix as that money will need to stretch through your retirement years. Keep in mind, how you feel about the risk associated with your portfolio are also important in determining the right mix.\n\nPeople in their 50s looking to retire sooner rather than later should also start mimicking their future lifestyle, by creating a financial plan or budget and spending less than they may currently be spending. That lifestyle should also be tested, to ensure they like it and can live within its means. By you being more disciplined on saving, it helps you be more disciplined on spending, Sotudeh said.\n\nSee also: When it comes to retirement, a dream isn't a plan\n\nOf course, the age in which someone retires is becoming fuzzy, said James Nichols, head of consumer solutions group at New York-based financial services firm Voya Financial, and people are expected to live longer in the future than they did decades ago. By these new standards, future retirees need to push away anxiety over potential money problems and get to business: take into account all expenses you'll possibly incur in retirement (such as health-care costs and bills), and save so you're not one of the many who are undersaved for retirement. That means taking the baby steps in your 50s to get to where you'd like to be in the future.\n\nYou may not be able to hit the number you were hoping for, but any number you add now will improve your lifestyle in the long run, Nichols said. You have to think of it incrementally.'\n\nRead:\n\n• This is how your finances should look in your 20s\n\n• This is how your finances should look in your 30s\n\n• This is how your finances should look in your 40s\n\n• This is how your finances should look in your 60s\n\nWondering what your savings should look like during a major money milestone?

As the weeks-long federal government shutdown continues with no end in sight, the President Donald Trump has backed himself into a corner.\n\nTrump insists on funding for a Mexican border wall as the necessary condition for ending the partial shutdown. On Wednesday hestormed out of a meeting with Democratic congressional leaders, reportedly telling House Speaker Nancy Pelosi we have nothing to discuss after she refused to agree to his wall.\n\nThe problem for Trump is that it's not obvious how he extricates himself from this self-imposed trap. Many voters blame the president for the shutdown. That's not surprising — Trump publicly declared that he'd be proud to take responsibility for it. With Democrats now in control of the House, they have been passing legislation to re-open the government without providing funding for the wall — and even some Republican members are voting with them. In the Senate, there are also signs that some Republicans are ready to support legislation re-opening the government. Although Trump insists the party is united behind him, Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS) suggested that we're [Senate Republicans] getting pretty close to a breaking point.\n\nThe shutdown fight isn't really about Democrats v. Republicans; its about Trump against the reality that neither Republicansnor Democrats support his wall. There simply aren't enough votes in Congress for Trump to secure a win. In a constitutional democracy, that would likely mean Trump is out of luck. But Trump has the instincts of an authoritarian. He does not believe ordinary rules apply to him.\n\nSo, as it has become clear that he can't get Congress to give him what he wants on his wall, Trump says he's thinking about taking matters into his own hands by declaring a national emergency — something Trump says he has the absolute right to do.\n\nPresidents in constitutional democracy don't have absolute powers: in the American system, they operate within a system of checks and balances. But some observers say it's an exaggeration to see Trump's threat to declare a phony national emergency as a dangerous power grab. In Politico, the headline for an opinion article written by Zachary Karabell urges people to stop freaking out about Trump's state of emergency threats. Karabell acknowledges that [d]eclaring a national emergency to solve an invented crisis might be misguided…[but] it [would not be] an existential threat. Karabell notes that other presidents have taken broader or more dangerous actions during past emergencies — Franklin Roosevelt during World War II; Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War — and American democracy survived. On Lawfare, the headline for a piece written by Quinta Jurecic urges everyone [to] calm down about the prospect of Trump declaring a contrived emergency. Jurecic agrees that it would be stupid for Trump to do this, but asserts that it would not, in itself, be a step toward authoritarianism.\n\nKarabell and Jurecic are right that, if Trump does use an invented emergency as the basis for gaining access to funds used for some construction of a wall, the United States would not immediately be plunged into dictatorship (especially if Trump claimed statutory authority, rather than inherent and unbounded constitutional authority, as a basis for action).\n\nBut that's the wrong way to think about this. As Stephen Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt observe in How Democracies Die, the drift away from democracy can be gradual. There often isn't a single dramatic moment when jack-booted troops march in the streets: democracies [can] erode slowly, in barely visible steps. Claims that Trump is another Adolf Hitler or Josef Stalin are of course wild exaggerations. The danger to the U.S. is something more like Hungary under Prime Minister Viktor Orban or Turkey under President Recep Erdogan — countries that maintain a veneer of democracy while eviscerating its substance. Even actions that are not illegal can undermine constitutional democracy: Levitsky and Ziblatt observe that the system depends in part on unwritten norms that set limits on power.\n\nAmerican democracy depends on the principle that everyone is accountable to the rule of law, that there are limits even on what a president can do. But Trump has shown he does not accept the idea of limits on power, that he favors unilateral action over the interactive give and take of a constitutional democracy. When something or someone gets in his way — whether it's Robert Mueller, James Comey, Jeff Sessions, or Congress itself — his impulse is to bully his way through or around the obstacle. He doesn't let unwritten rules stop him from doing what he wants — whether it's profiting from his office, refusing to disclose his tax returns, or giving top jobs to unqualified family members.\n\nAll of these actions have chipped away at the foundations of our constitutional democracy. If Trump does declare a national emergency in order to gain access to funds used for some construction of the wall he craves, his action should be understood in this broader context. This is a president with clear authoritarian tendencies, who believes he can do as he likes. He is constantly testing the limits. Baselessly declaring a national emergency in order to get his way would be just the latest example. If Congress — which hasthe authority to stop the president if it chooses to do so — failed to act and allowed Trump to, once again, get what he wants, the message to Trump would be loud, clear, and dangerous.\n\nChris Edelson is an assistant professor of government in American University's School of Public Affairs.

Not only do defined-benefit plans still exist, they are just the ticket for investors in particular situations.\n\nI'm referring, of course, to the kind of retirement plan that used to be the most common way in which corporations funded their employees' retirement. These plans, also known as pensions, guaranteed a certain level of payment during retirement.\n\nCorporate defined-benefit plans fell out of favor a couple of decades ago, however, and few investors are even aware that they still exist. But they very much do, though now it's up to us to set them up. And there can be huge tax advantages for doing so.\n\nA personal defined-benefit plan provides a guaranteed payout in your retirement years, just like the defined-benefit plans of old. The yearly payout can be no larger than the average of your three highest-earning years, up to a maximum of $215,000. The amount you invest in your plan—which must be substantial to provide such a large guaranteed payout—is tax deductible.\n\nTherein lies the major benefit of these personal defined-benefit plans. With a 401(k) plan, in contrast, the maximum amount you can invest tax-free each year is $18,500 (if you're over 50, this amount increases to $24,500). With a defined-benefit plan, this maximum amount can be an order of magnitude larger.\n\nRead: How much can I contribute to my 401(k) this year?\n\nWhat to do in your 50s to build wealth for your retirement\n\nThe exact amount of this larger maximum is dependent on a number of assumptions, such as your age when you set up the plan, your income history, your life expectancy, and what actuarial assumptions are used to project stock and bond returns into the future. Charles Schwab, which can help clients set up these plans and then oversee and administer them, illustrated what this maximum would be by focusing on a hypothetical 55-year old in 2016 who intended to retire when he is 65, and whose income for the prior three years averaged $260,000 a year. The firm calculated that this hypothetical physician would have been able to contribute as much as $165,800 in pretax dollars into a personal defined-benefit plan.\n\nTo get early access to many more stories like this, subscribe to Retirement Weekly\n\nThat provides a huge tax benefit for someone who needs to fund his or her retirement in a big hurry and has the means to do so. Is there a catch?\n\nActually there are several, because of which personal defined-benefit plans aren't for everyone. Here are the factors to keep in mind when deciding whether to even consider setting up such a plan:\n\n•You must fund the plan annually. Each year an actuary must sign off on your plan, indicating how much additional you must contribute that year to keep your plan fully funded. You have no choice but to meet that commitment, or else face IRS fines and possible retroactive disallowance of the deductibility of contributions to the plan. You must be confident that you will have sufficient income in each of the years between when you set up a plan and when you retire to meet this annual commitment.\n\n•Your requirement contribution will most likely mushroom during a bear market. Insofar as the investments in your defined-benefit plan fail to live up to what your actuary previously assumed, your annual commitment will have to be much larger still. This is especially worth remembering now, given that we very likely are in a low-return environment for both stocks and bonds. Research Affiliates, for example, the well-known investment firm founded by Robert Arnott, forecasts that the S&P 500 over the next decade will produce a return of just 2.5% annualized, while intermediate-term corporate bonds are projected to produce a return of just 2.7% annualized.\n\n•High fees. Schwab, for example, charges $1,500 a year to set up, oversee and administer a personal defined-benefit plan with just one participant.\n\n•You need to have a high and steady income. This requirement is because of the above three factors. Schwab, for one, estimates that earnings, before considering the defined-benefit plan contribution, need to be $250,000 or more a year to make the cost of running the plan low relative to the tax savings.\n\nI mention these factors not to scare you away, but to emphasize that these personal defined-benefit plans aren't for everyone. But since most investors in my experience aren't even aware that they exist, chances are that some of you could benefit greatly from setting one up.\n\nFor more information, including descriptions of the Hulbert Sentiment Indices, go to The Hulbert Financial Digestor email mark@hulbertratings.com.
SSRN, the Social Science Research Network, published its top 10 papers of 2015, and one of my papers, Understanding the Modern Monetary System, came in at No. 6. I'm incredibly humbled to be on a list like that, with names like Fama, French, Asness and Faber.\n\nMany of the papers are old, so they end up on a list like this because they're legacy papers that have stood the test of time. My paper was originally written in 2011 and has gone through a number of edits over time, so I thought I'd offer up some more timely papers that I found useful last year. I hope you find them helpful. I know I did.\n\nWhat Is an Index? by Andrew Lo\n\nAs you might know, I've been on a bit of a kick with benchmarks, as I've tried to explain some of the confusion between active and passive investing. In my mind, there is really only one global benchmark and anyone who deviates from the Global Financial Asset Portfolio is therefore engaging in active investing. We are all essentially asset pickers inside of this one aggregate portfolio. Knowing what an index actually is — and how arbitrary the term is — can be a good starting point for understanding what I am ranting about.\n\nAn Evaluation of Smart Beta by Vanguard\n\nSmart beta was one of the hottest terms on Wall Street last year. Vanguard, the world's largest fund manager, will help you understand what all the fuss was about — mostly high-fee smart marketing if you ask me.\n\nFactor-Based Investing by Vanguard\n\nThis is another excellent explainer from Vanguard. I am not a big advocate of factor investing, but if you want to understand the fuss, Vanguard has your back.\n\nWhy Indexing Works by Heaton, Polson and Witte\n\nThis is one of the best and shortest papers of the year. As you may know, I am a huge fan of indexing, and this paper gets right to the point. Indexing works because it's low-fee, tax-efficient and diversified. Enough said.\n\nSecular Stagnation: The Long View by Barry Eichengreen\n\nSecular stagnation was all the rage in economics this year, as Barry Eichengreen and Larry Summers put their full weight behind the concept. In this paper, Eichengreen discusses four long-term factors that could drive the stagnation.\n\nReviving the Limit Cycle View of Macroeconomic Fluctuations by Beaudry, Galizia and Portier\n\nThis was one of my favorite papers of the year. I've always liked the idea that busts are caused by booms. That is, expansions don't die of old age, but of excess. This paper revives an old debate about what causes business-cycle deviations and how booms might be the cause of busts.\n\nThe Allure of the Outlier by Vanguard\n\nThis is another great piece from Vanguard on the risks to consider when assessing alternative investments. As hedge funds and other alternative investments struggle to perform, they are coming under increasing scrutiny.

Despite the partial government shutdown, it should (mostly) be business as usual for students relying on federal student loans to afford college and borrowers repaying them.\n\nThe Department of Education remains fully funded, which means its contractors are still collecting student loan payments and the agency is still dispersing grants and federal student loans. Still, students, borrowers and schools may experience some hiccups for tasks that require information from another agency experiencing greater impacts from the shutdown, like the IRS.\n\nIt's the other departments that are running into some issues, said Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of savingforcollege.com and a financial aid expert.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nBorrowers repaying their student loans\n\nPerhaps the most important thing that borrowers who are repaying their student loans should know is that the shutdown doesn't affect their student loan bills.\n\nBorrowers should be operating as if everything is normal and there is no disruption at all, said Justin Draeger, the president of the National Association of Financial Aid Administrators, a professional association for financial aid officers. In other words: Don't stop paying your loans, he says.\n\nStill, the shutdown could impact some borrowers trying to manage their debt. Borrowers who want to take advantage of the government's income-driven repayment plans, which allow them to pay off their debt as a percentage of their income, need to show proof of income to their student loan servicer. They also need to recertify their income every year to stay on the plans.\n\nThe IRS, which has had many of its duties curtailed due to the shutdown, typically plays a role in both cases. Usually, borrowers will use the IRS data retrieval tool, which electronically transfers tax information into their income driven repayment plan application. Department of Education officials say the tool is operating as normal. The IRS did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nBorrowers applying for an income-driven repayment plan or re-certifying their income for an IDR plan should try to use the data retrieval tool, Kantrowitz said. If for some reason, they hit a snag — the tools don't always run perfectly, he noted — under normal circumstances a borrower would download their tax transcript from the IRS and file a paper application.\n\nBut the tax transcript service is currently down. Officials at the Department of Education and the IRS told Politico the outage isn't due to the shutdown and they expect the tool to be back up on January 14. In the meantime, while the shutdown persists, borrowers trying to get their tax information will likely struggle to find someone to take their calls at the IRS, Kantrowitz said.\n\nBorrowers whose circumstances have changed since they last filed their tax return — information that won't be reflected in the data retrieval tool — can use other documentation to prove their income, like pay stubs or a letter from their employer. But because those documents typically show net income and not gross income — which is available through tax documents and on which the calculation for income-driven repayment plans are usually based — borrowers' loan payments could wind up being higher, Kantrowitz said.\n\nStudents applying for and receiving aid\n\nThe lack of availability of tax transcripts is also causing a snag for some students applying for aid, experts say. Roughly 30% of students who fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, are flagged for verification each year, a process that requires them to prove their income. Typically these students use a tax transcript to verify their income.\n\nBasically there's a big bottleneck in the process at this point, said David Baime, the senior vice president for government relations and policy analysis at the American Association of Community Colleges.\n\nBaime said his organization has heard from its member schools with great concern about students unable to complete their FAFSA due to the tax transcript issue. Unfortunately, this issue is likely affecting students who need the funds the most — college officials say they observe that low-income students are more likely to be flagged for verification. In some cases, colleges are working with students to allow them to start the semester in the absence of financing until the issues are resolved, Baime said.\n\nThe bottom line is that our colleges — and their students more importantly — are really in many places in a very difficult situation in terms of financing, Baime said.\n\nOn Wednesday, a day after this story was originally published, the Department of Education released guidance on alternative documents students flagged for verification could use to prove their income to their schools during the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 application cycles. (Department of Education officials had announced at a conference in November that they were looking at making these changes.)\n\nUnder the Department's new guidance, students and families who were flagged for verification and have difficulty obtaining their tax transcript can use a signed copy of their 2016 or 2017 income tax return to prove their income.\n\nStudents and families who aren't required to file a tax return still need to attempt to get verification from the IRS that they're non-filers, but if that's unavailable, they can submit a sworn statement to their school indicating they couldn't get the documentation, didn't file a 2016 or 2017 tax return, a list of income from work and the sources of the income and finally a copy of a W-2 for each source of work listed.\n\nDraeger said in an email that colleges were ecstatic about the new guidance and eager to get students out of the financial aid limbo they've been experiencing since the IRS transcript request services went down, unannounced, a few weeks ago.\n\nSchools will move quickly to contact affected students, verify their income or tax filing status using the new guidance, and get them the financial aid for which they qualify, he wrote.\n\nQuestions on the FAFSA that require interactions with other agencies are also causing hiccups for some students and schools. In order to qualify for federal financial aid, male students need to register for the draft. The FAFSA typically performs a database match with the Selective Service Administration to make sure required students have registered, but right now that match is failing, Draeger said. Colleges are able to look students up individually to make sure they're registered, he said.\n\nDespite these challenges, for the most part, students shouldn't see any effect on their financial aid during the shutdown, Draeger said.\n\nThe Department [of Education] is funded, federal student aid dollars are flowing, he said.\n\nGovernment workers affected by the shutdown\n\nThough most student loan borrowers aren't impacted by the shutdown, those who belong to the group of government workers that are furloughed and not receiving a paycheck may be struggling to make their monthly payments.\n\nThe Department of Education advises borrowers for whom that's the case to contact their student loan servicer to discuss their repayment options.\n\nAdam Minsky, a Boston-based student loan lawyer, suggests government workers who are furloughed and on an income-driven plan apply to have their monthly payments reduced based on their changed circumstances. If possible, they should resist entering a forbearance — a temporary status that pauses payments, but where interest accrues.\n\nEntering forbearance could wind up costing borrowers more in the long run both because interest capitalizes at the end of a forbearance period and because any time spent in forbearance delays progress towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which allows borrowers working in public service, including for the federal government, to have their loans forgiven after at least 10 years of payments.\n\nThis story was updated on Jan. 9, 2019.
As companies try to understand consumer behavior and unemployment falls to a record low, data scientists are in high demand.\n\nBoasting a median base salary of $110,000 and a job-satisfaction score of 4.4 out of 5, data scientist was ranked No. 1 on Glassdoor's most Best Jobs in America list in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. The list released earlier this year is based on the number of job openings, salary and overall job satisfaction. It was followed by devops engineers ($110,000 a year), which combines development, testing and operations. Nearly 40% of people, including 56% of millennials, are job hunting it added. (Here is a review of 7 free online coding courses.)\n\nBut data scientists have competition. A separate 2018 report by the U.S. News & World Report lists software developer as the No. 1 job based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Like data scientist, a software developer has a median annual salary of over $100,000 per year and are employed in computer systems design, app design, manufacturing and finance. The study looked at work-life balance, salary and other areas of career development. (Dentist was No. 2, followed by physician assistant and nurse practitioner.)\n\nData scientists and software developers use programming language such as Python (sought after in 72% of Glassdoor data scientist job postings), followed by R (64%), SQL (51%), Hadoop (39%) and the more well-known Java (33%). Core data scientists who are likely to be proficient in Python, R and SQL and estimated to make $116,203 a year. Google GOOG, -2.62% , Aetna US:AET, and Microsoft MSFT, -2.67% typically hire these. The top programming languages are Java, Python, JavaScript and C++, according to TechRepublic.com.\n\nHow you teach a computer to drive like a human\n\nDon't miss:5 blue-collar jobs that pay $100,000 a year\n\nBecause data science is such a new field, there's very little consensus on what work they do, or what skills are required, says Pablo Ruiz Junco, economic research fellow at Glassdoor. And the best part about the No. 1 skill? Python is free, easy to learn, he says. Because of its large user base, many specialized packages for statistics, machine learning and graphing are available for data scientists to use. Plus, writing code in Python makes it more shareable within a company and easier to implement into production because it is so widely used by software engineers.\n\nThere is, however, some bad news for American workers. Pay raises for U.S. employees are not expected to improve in 2018, according to a survey of 1,000 companies released Monday by global professional services company Aon. Base pay is expected to rise 3% in 2018, up slightly from 2.9% in 2017. Spending on variable pay — incentives or bonuses — will be 12.5% of payroll, low levels not seen since 2013. This suggests a pessimistic view of corporate performance in the coming year, Ken Abosch, a strategy and development analyst at Aon, said in a statement.\n\nIn the meantime, some 7.5 million American workers work multiple jobs, and 44 million people have a side hustle. Personal-finance site Bankrate released a survey last year, which found that younger millennials (ages 18 to 26) are most likely to have a side hustle, with 28% saying they have an extra way to make money aside from their main source of income. While some very fortunate people have turned their hobbies into six-figure careers, as MarketWatch previously reported, most people use them to supplement their income.
While the partial government shutdown is largely bad news for U.S. companies, payday lenders look set for a boost.\n\nWe're now getting to the point where federal employees are going to need some kind of short-term loan in some cases, said federal budget expert Stan Collender.\n\nIn cases where these employees can't turn to family or friends, companies that provide payday loans are going to benefit a little bit, because there's going to be a request for funds, said Collender, known for his Budget Guy blog.\n\nAbout 800,000 federal employees are furloughed or working without wages thanks to the shutdown, now in its 21th day. They are missing out on paychecks for the first time on Friday, which otherwise generally would have been payday.\n\nRelated:More banks are trying to get a piece of the payday loan pie\n\nAnd see:Four in 10 can't cover an emergency expense of $400, Fed survey finds\n\nBeyond conventional payday lenders, some credit unions that serve government employees are offering loans to affected workers during the shutdown, and they're not necessarily charging the high interest that's usually associated with cash advances. The Navy Federal Credit Union, for example, is offering to lend up to $6,000 to eligible members, saying there will be no fees or interest charges, while the Congressional Federal Credit Union will extend a line of credit with a 0% interest rate for 60 days.\n\nSuch offers during the shutdown make sense, given that many studies have shown Americans often have low levels of savings. Big banks including Wells Fargo WFC, -0.88% and Bank of America BAC, -0.29% are not making similar loans to affected government workers, a New York Times report noted, though some are waiving overdraft and monthly service fees. Pro baseball is getting involved, as the Washington Nationals said affected season ticket holders could postpone monthly payments for tickets.\n\nThe payday lending industry's trade group, the Community Financial Services Association of America, didn't respond to requests for comment. Lenders World Acceptance Corp. WRLD, +1.06% and Enova International Inc. ENVA, -8.25% also didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nIt's possible that tax-preparation companies could see more demand for refund-advance loans, Collender said. The shutdown has threatened to delay the actual refunds, though the Trump administration said Monday that they would go out as usual.\n\nRead more:3 ways to protect your finances if you're a federal employee not getting paid\n\nFor the most part, the shutdown is a drag on big and small companies, according to Collender. He said: You see mostly losers here. Coffee shops, taxi businesses and other companies that serve government employees could be cutting their staffing, and small firms that provide things like office supplies are losing business and not likely to recoup it, the budget expert said.\n\nThere is incredible uncertainty relating to the TSA, and as that relates to air travel and tourism, said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research for Compass Point Research and Trading, referring to reports of longer lines at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints as agents who aren't getting paid call out sick. (In the wake of such reports, the TSA said 90% of U.S. passengers waited less than 15 minutes on Sunday, while a big pilots union has called for an end to the shutdown because it's hurting safety and efficiency.)\n\nSome airlines have voiced concerns about delays in the certification of new aircraft and slowdowns in the training of pilots and air traffic controllers, said Clayton Allen, a Height Capital Markets analyst.\n\nOne of the things that is maybe not appreciable now, but will have an impact as time goes on, is the impact on air traffic control, he told MarketWatch. We have a shortage of air traffic controllers, so slowing down the training process today means that a year from now, six month from now, you're not going to have as many air traffic controllers as you thought you would.\n\nThe aviation industry is hurt in particular because two key government entities that it must deal with are affected by the shutdown — the Homeland Security Department and the Federal Aviation Administration, Allen added.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is also hit by the government closure, the Height analyst noted.\n\nThat's not really a positive for financial markets SPX, -0.16% , because not having a regulator in your office doesn't mean you can run hog wild. It just means you can't get sign-off on things, Allen said. I kind of struggle to find people who are winning in this scenario, from a corporate perspective.\n\nThe shutdown is disrupting the initial-public-offering process and may cause delays in some of the bigger IPOs expected in 2019. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which lobbies for big business in Washington, has called for an end to the closure, saying it's hearing every day from businesses across the country about how the adverse consequences of the shutdown are wide and growing.\n\nThe ongoing shutdown has been sparked by a dispute over money for President Donald Trump's proposed wall at the Mexican border. The president on Wednesday left a negotiating session after clashing with top Democratic lawmakers, and Trump stated Thursday that he could declare a national emergency in order to build his wall if there's no deal with Democrats, saying probably I will do it. I would almost say definitely. Analysts have noted the impact of the current shutdown is somewhat limited, because it's only affecting agencies that represent about 25% of total government spending.\n\nThis report was first published on Jan. 8, 2019.
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings before the bell on Friday, and investors are expecting another strong quarter for trading.\n\nSee also:Bank ETFs still favored as investors see growth and Trump bump ahead\n\nChief Executive Jamie Dimon said in December he expects trading revenue to rise about 15% from the year-earlier period, as activity in fixed-income trading picked up after the November presidential election, while equity indexes surged to record levels, The Wall Street Journal reported. The surprise victory of Donald Trump is expected to lead to a major rollback of regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, creating growth opportunities for banks.\n\nDimon said his bank JPM, +1.65% has benefited in fixed-income trading from the exit from that business by many European banks that are dealing with their own issues. Fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading rebounded in 2016 after a long period of weakness that led many banks to cut staff on trading desks.\n\nJamie Dimon on 'The Door to Diversity'\n\nMeanwhile, the prospect of higher interest rates is expected to boost margins on lending.\n\nCorporate tax reform is another potentially positive for the space as is the expectation of an elevated growth trajectory for the U.S. economy, said Zacks Research Director, Sheraz Mian. All in all, the industry's operating and regulatory outlook has never been this favorable in a long time.\n\nThis has started showing up in bank stock EPS estimates as well, though the impact is most pronounced in expectations for the outer periods.\n\nSee also: End of a stock-market era: Alcoa breaks tradition of being first to report earnings\n\nHere's what to expect from J.P.

Estimize, which crowdsources estimates from buy-side and sell-side analysts, hedge-fund managers, academics and others, is expecting a higher number of $1.47 a share.\n\nRevenue: Revenue is expected to total $23.912 billion, up from $23.747 billion a year ago. Estimize is expecting revenue of $23.641 billion.\n\nStock price action: Like many of its peers, J.P. Morgan stock has rallied since the presidential election, tacking on about 23% amid expectations for deregulation. The KBW Nasdaq Bank exchange-traded fund BKX, +1.24% has gained about 23% since the election, while the S&P SPX, -1.48% has added 6.1%.

Morgan's corporate and investment banking business to benefit from what is a potentially more benign regulatory environment that could spur capital markets velocity and increase risk appetite. Analysts initiated coverage on the stock Wednesday with a buy rating and raised their stock price target to $98 from $91.\n\nUBS is expecting J.P. Morgan's return on tangible common equity to move closer to a midteen range by 2019 from about 12% currently.\n\nContinued good operating momentum, higher interest rates, moderately improved efficiency, a lesser drag from the cards business, and elevated capital returns (70-75% of earnings) should help, they wrote.\n\nSee also: Gross says this key bond level is a far bigger deal than Dow 20,000
Meb Faber asked a bunch of us bloggers to give him our top 3-5 most-read blog posts of the year. I looked back at my trusty Google Analytics for the first time in a while and discovered that two of my top three in terms of readership were personal-finance-related posts (this one and this one). I've always said that personal finances are more important than portfolio management, but I still think there's probably not enough people writing or providing education on the topic.\n\nSo I'm going to make a concerted effort to write more about personal finance in the coming year.\n\nHere's my list of 20 personal-finance rules:\n\n1. Salary is not the same as savings. Your net worth is more important than how much money you make. It's amazing how many people don't realize this simply truth. Having a high salary does not automatically make you rich; having a low salary does not automatically make you poor. All that matters is how much you save out of your salary.\n\n2. Saving is more important than investing. Pay yourself first is such simple advice, but so few people do this. The best investment decision you can make it to set a high savings rate because it gives you a huge margin of safety in life.\n\n3. Avoid credit card debt like the plague. Carrying credit card debt is a great way to negatively compound your net worth.\n\nRead:You're not Warren Buffett, but you can take his advice on your finances\n\n4. Live below your means, not within your means. The only way to get ahead financially is to stay behind your own earnings power.\n\n5. But credit itself is important. Likely the biggest expense over your lifetime will be interest costs on your mortgage, car loans, student loans, etc. Having a solid credit score can save you tens of thousands of dollars by lowering your borrowing costs. So use credit cards, but always pay off the balance each month.\n\n6. If you want to understand your priorities look at where you spend money each month. You have to understand your spending habits if you ever wish to gain control of your finances. The goal is to spend money on things that are important to you but cut back everywhere else. And if you pay yourself first you don't have to worry about budgeting, you just spend whatever's left over.\n\n7. Automate everything. The best way to save more, avoid late fees, make your life easier and get out of your own way is to automate as much of your financial life as possible. It probably takes me one hour a month to keep track of everything because it's all on autopilot.\n\n8. Get the big purchases right. I know I shouldn't be so judgmental but whenever I see $50,000-$70,000 SUVs on the road or enormous McMansions, the first thing that pops into my head is, I wonder how much they have saved for retirement? Personal finance experts love to debate the minutia of brown-bag lunches and lattes, but the most important purchases in terms of keeping your finances in order will be the big ones — housing and transportation. Overextending yourself on these can be a killer.\n\nRead:How to buy a $35,000 brand-new electric car for under $14,000\n\n9. Build up that savings account. I don't even like calling it an emergency savings account anymore because most of the time these emergencies are things you should plan on happening periodically. You have to have liquid assets to take care of things when life inevitably gets in the way.\n\n10. Cover your insurable needs. This is another huge personal finance margin of safety item. Just remember than insurance is about protecting wealth, not building it.\n\n11. Always get the match. I can't tell you how many times I've talked to people who aren't saving enough in their 401(k) plan to get the employer match. That's like turning down a tax-deferred portion of your salary each year. I'd like to see more people max out their retirement contributions, but at a minimum you should *always* save enough to get the match.\n\nRead:How to manage your 401(k) to ensure your retirement doesn't stink\n\n12. Save a little more each year. The trick is to increase your savings rates every time you get a raise so you'll never even notice that you had more money to begin with. Avoiding lifestyle creep can be difficult, but that's how you build wealth.\n\n13. Choose your friends and neighborhood wisely. Robert Cialdini has written extensively on the concept of social proof and how we mirror the actions of others to gain acceptance. Trying to keep up with spendthrift friends or neighbors is a never-ending game with no true winners.\n\n14. Talk about money. It takes all of 5 minutes before I hear about politics in almost any conversation these days, but somehow money is still a taboo subject. Talk to your spouse about money. Ask others for help. Don't allow financial problems to linger and get worse.\n\nHow biometrics could replace your entire wallet\n\n15. Material purchases won't make you happier in the long run. There is something of a short-term dopamine hit we get through retail therapy, but it always wears off. Buying stuff won't make you happier or wealthier.\n\n16. Read a book, or 10. There are countless personal finance books out there. If it bores you to death then at least skim through a few and pick out the best pieces of advice from a few different sources to test out. This stuff should be taught in every high school and college, but we're often on our own. That means you have to take the initiative.\n\nNeed book recommendations? Check out MarketWatch's BookWatch section\n\n17. Know where you stand. Everyone should have a back-of-the-envelope idea about where their net worth (assets – liabilities) stands. Before knowing where you want to go you have to know where you are.\n\n18. Taxes matter. I think everyone should try to do their own taxes at least once just to understand how it all works (maybe with an assist from TurboTax). It can be maddeningly complicated, but it can help you save money over time if you know where to look. Take advantage of as many tax breaks as you can and always understand your personal tax situation.\n\nRead:How to reduce your 2016 tax bill and Even more ways to lower your tax bill\n\n19. Make more money. Saving and/or cutting back is a great way to get ahead, but it's an incomplete strategy if you're not trying to earn more by enhancing your career. Too many people are stuck in the mindset that there's nothing they can do to get a better job, take on more responsibilities or earn a higher salary. That's nonsense.\n\n20. Don't think about retirement, but financial independence. The goal shouldn't be about making it to a certain age so you can ride off into the sunset, but rather getting to the point where you don't have to worry about money anymore.\n\nYou make disagree with some of these, but remember — personal finance is personal.\n\nBen Carlson is the author of the blog A Wealth of Common Sense, where this was first published.

There's a new top retirement state in town, and it's not Florida, Arizona or any of the usual Sunbelt suspects.\n\nStep forward … Delaware.\n\nThe tiny mid-Atlantic corporate enclave, now famous as the home state of the incoming president, came out as the surprising No. 1 destination for retirees (according to one way of calculating, anyway).\n\nThese results come from the latest United Van Lines annual survey of who's moving where and why.\n\nUnited Van Lines, the country's biggest full-service moving company, operates about 300 agencies across the U.S. and typically handles around 100,000 moves a year. It's been conducting the survey for 40 years.\n\nIn 2020, 41% of those moving to Delaware cited retirement among their reasons. That was the highest percentage among the inward bound of any state, just edging out second-place Montana.\n\nLast year 77% of those who moved to Delaware were over 55.\n\nThe appeal of Montana last year may be a little less surprising. The Big Sky State is part of the so-called American Redoubt — the thinly populated region that has long been popular among preppers and survivalists. If ever there was a year when preppers and survivalists had the news flow all their own way, it was 2020.\n\nBut why Delaware? Prior to Joe Biden's election, it really only had three claims to fame.\n\nFirst, many big companies have their titular headquarters there for tax and legal purposes.\n\nSecond, it was the first state to ratify the U.S. Constitution, so it is sometimes known as the First State.\n\nAnd, third: When people sitting in a bar try to name all 50 states, and get stuck on 49, Delaware has a very good chance of being the one they forgot.\n\nBut United Van Lines' communications director, Eily Cummings, says the state has been on the way up among retirees for a couple of years now (whereas Montana saw a big jump last year alone).\n\nLiz Keller, director of the Delaware Tourism Office, says many retirees come from the big nearby states, and retire to Delaware because they already have a second home there. Specifically the Delaware beaches have been larger areas for retirees, she says. A lot of people do pick a second home [here] and use it as a vacation home until they're ready to retire. Our beaches our beautiful!\n\nDelaware is near the big population centers around Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey and southern New York. Retirees are apparently hoping the proximity means the children and grandchildren will come and visit more often. Especially if it's on the beach. Your extended family can come visit you, says Keller. And why not come visit your grandparents at the beaches?\n\nDelaware, she adds, is only a couple of hours' drive, at most, from the big cities.\n\nThat's also a draw when it comes to health care, a big concern for people in retirement, especially once they hit their 70s and 80s. Delaware has its own big hospitals, says Keller. But it can't hurt that you're so close to the medical centers at the University of Pennsylvania and Johns Hopkins and the vast health-care resources of New York City.\n\nThe state has its own attractions, notes Keller. Not just the beaches in the south, but picturesque small towns in the center, and historic mansions in and around Wilmington in the north. Those include the Nemours Estate, modeled after the Versailles Palace in France. Who knew?\n\nFor $335,000 you can park your rocking chair on a porch in Dover, the Delaware capital.\n\nTaxes aren't quite the draw I had assumed. Delaware has no state sales tax, but the Tax Foundation, a low-tax-advocate think tank based in Washington, D.C., ranks its state and local taxes the 14th highest in the country per capita.\n\nIt is, at least, a lower-tax state than New York, Connecticut or Maryland, or Washington, D.C., the foundation reports.\n\nDelaware isn't a cheap place to move, either. Property company Zillow estimates that the average home in Delaware costs $284,000, just ahead of its national estimate. Much of that is driven by expensive beachfront property. Among the more affordable, up-and-coming areas, Keller cites the town of Milford, a bit inland. It's more affordable than your waterfront properties, she says, and offers picturesque living 20 minutes from the beach.
Rookie Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shot back at critics who say her progressive agenda is too radical and expensive, saying there's nothing revolutionary about providing people with good jobs, health care and an education.\n\nWhen you can't provide for your kids working a full-time job, working two full-time jobs. When you can't have health care. That is not dignified, Ocasio-Cortez told CBS' 60 Minutes in an interview that aired Sunday.\n\nThe 29-year-old newly minted House member is entering office with an ambitious agenda — including Medicare-for-all, tuition-free public college, and sweeping environmental protections.\n\nHow are you going to pay for all that? CBS's Anderson Cooper asked her.\n\nNo one asks how we're going to pay for this Space Force. No one asked how we paid for a $2 trillion tax cut, she said. We only ask how we pay for it on issues of housing, health care and education. How do we pay for it? With the same exact mechanisms that we pay for military increases for this Space Force.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, a self-described Democratic socialist, was asked about a comment from Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., that if unrealistic proposals are pushed Democrats who just regained control of the House might look like they're unable to govern.\n\nWe pay more per capita in health care and education for lower outcomes than many other nations. And so for me, what's unrealistic is what we're living in right now, she said.\n\nHer proposal to increase taxes on the wealthy to fund her Green New Deal, which aims to eliminate carbon emissions in the U.S. within 12 years, was highly criticized.\n\nRead: Ocasio-Cortez suggests marginal income-tax rates as high as 70%\n\nOcasio-Cortez, who seemingly came out of nowhere to defeat political power broker Rep. Joe Crowley in June's Democratic primary, said her brand of Democratic socialism is not the type critics say are associated with economically troubled Cuba and Venezuela.\n\nShe said what she and her colleagues have in mind resemble what we see in the UK, in Norway, in Finland, in Sweden.\n\nThis report originally appeared on NYPost.com.
Q.: A friend of mine bought an annuity and raves about how much tax-free income he is getting and that it is guaranteed for life. Another friend of mine says annuities are a tax time bomb. Who is right? — Lester in Omaha\n\nA.: Well, Lester I think the time bomb friend is more correct. Based on the description, I think they are talking about two entirely different types of annuities.\n\nIt sounds like your income friend has an immediate annuity. He is NOT getting tax-free interest income. He is getting a monthly annuity payment of which a portion is not taxed. It is not taxed because it is considered a return of his investment principal.\n\nHe traded a lump sum for a lifetime of steady checks. Those checks can stop before he gets all his money back.\n\nFor example, an online illustrator indicates a 65-year-old male that buys an immediate annuity for $100,000 can get a monthly payment of $565 until his death. Versions that would make any payments beyond his death payout less. So $565 a month equates to 6.78% a year of his investment but he is not getting anywhere near 6.78% in interest or earnings. He doesn't net any investment return until he gets back $100,000 in payments which will take until he reaches age 79 and nine months. If he dies before this time, his internal rate of return (IRR) will be negative.\n\nBy law, the insurer must be conservative with the funds so the actual interest is going to be quite modest. The amount of each payment that is nontaxable is based on an exclusion ratio (see IRS Publication 939).\n\nThe exclusion ratio table expects a 20-year lifespan for our hypothetical 65 year-old and spreads the return of principal over that period. The result is that the IRS consider $417 of the $565 as tax-free return of principal and only $148 as interest taxed as ordinary income. Once he has received 20 years of payments (age 85), he has received back all of his initial investment and all of his payments are fully taxable for the remainder of his life.\n\nImmediate annuities can be a very helpful part of one's retirement plan because nothing else is guaranteed to payout regardless of how long one lives. That guarantee has a lot of value for many people but from a purely rate of return perspective, these arrangements only pay off well if the annuitant has above-average longevity. The longer one lives, the better. If our 65-year-old lives to age 90, the IRR is about 4.6%, a strong result given no market risk.\n\nYour time bomb friend may be talking about the point where the payments become fully taxable but he is more likely describing a deferred annuity rather than an immediate annuity.\n\nWith a deferred annuity, you put in your cash and you are not taxed on earnings until you take money out. It is like an IRA in that respect but there are no contribution limits or Required Minimum Distributions.\n\nThe time bomb comes over time as the contract continues to accrue earnings. Taxes are only deferred not avoided.\n\nPut $100,000 in one of these and have it grow to $200,000. Need $40,000 for a new car? The first $40,000 out comes from the earnings and is taxable as ordinary income, not at the lower capital-gains rates.\n\nIf you never need any of the $200,000, when your heirs inherit it, the earnings come out and are taxed at their ordinary income rates.\n\nContrast that to an investment in a traditional taxable account worth $200,000 with a basis of $100,000. Need $40,000? Sell for $40,000 in proceeds. $20,000 is your gain ($100,000/$200,000 = ½. Half of $40,000 is $20,000). Regardless of income level, capital gain rates are lower than the rates on ordinary income. That $20,000 gain is taxed at anywhere from 0 to 23.8% and the other $20,000 is not taxed at all.\n\nIf the $200,000 in the taxable account is left to your heirs, it gets a step up in basis. When the inheritors sell, they will compare their proceeds to $200,000, not $100,000 so any gain should be minimal.\n\nThus your time bomb friend may be lamenting that while you are avoiding some current taxation, an annuity can create a large future tax bill for you or someone else.\n\nIf you have a question for Dan, please email him with MarketWatch Q&A on the subject line.\n\nDan Moisand'scomments are for informational purposes only and are not a substitute for personalized advice.

U.S. stocks on Tuesday started the first trading day of 2017 on a positive note but closed off of intraday highs as oil prices turned sharply lower, puncturing some of the initial exuberance that underpinned an early rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nThe Dow DJIA, -0.46% rose 119.16 points, or 0.6%, to close at 19,881.76. The blue-chip index had gained as much as 176 points at one point during the session. Nike Inc. NKE, -1.14% and Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, +1.00% were among the biggest gainers while Travelers Cos. Inc. TRV, -0.69% , and McDonald's Corp. MCD, -0.54% were notable laggards.\n\nThe S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% also finished off its best levels, adding 19 points, or 0.9%, to end at 2,257.83. The index had been up as much as 25 points in early morning action. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% climbed 45.97 points, or 0.9%, to close at 5,429.08.\n\nStocks started with a bit of a rally as the market tried to make up for some of the losses from last week, said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading.\n\nHowever, the strong start out of the gate soon fizzled as oil turned weak. Crude futures CLG27, fell more than 2% after jumping as much as 2.6% as a deal by OPEC to limit output went into effect.\n\nThe choppy action was the latest reminder of how the market has struggled in recent sessions with the Dow unable to break above 20,000, a key psychological milestone that some analysts see as a resistance level for the market.\n\nOnce you get closer to 20,000, historically it's been hard to get through on the first pass, said Kepner.\n\nStill, even though Wall Street stalled in the final sessions of 2016, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.1% in its last week of the year, it has been in a fairly pronounced uptrend since early November, when Trump won the U.S. presidential election. While financial stocks have accounted for the lion's share of the market's postelection gains, investors are betting that the policies Trump is expected to pursue will accelerate economic growth.\n\nThat thesis is still viewed as intact, although the size and speed of the recent rally could lead investors to take profits.\n\nThere are people who say things are getting pricey, but corporate fundamentals are there. Even if Trump's policies don't come to fruition, I think the fundamentals are strong enough to keep the market rising, said Peter Andersen, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co, who said he was fairly optimistic about U.S. stocks.\n\nRead:Stock-market bulls wary of new-year hangover\n\nIn addition to Trump's policies, investors will be monitoring the president-elect's Twitter feed, which he has used to take shots at specific companies. On Tuesday, he criticized General Motors Co. GM, -1.30% in a tweet, writing that the company is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers tax-free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax! While the stock fell in premarket trading, it subsequently turned higher, rising 0.9%.\n\nThe tweet followed similar statements against Boeing Co. BA, -2.86% and Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, +2.12%\n\nTrump is making it both easy and difficult for stock pickers, said Andersen. We're getting surgical precision when it comes to commentary on specific companies, but we're still getting our sea legs with how to interpret this data. It could be more symbolic than concrete in its meaning, but we don't know. We're in a steep learning curve with him.\n\nIn other company news, Xerox Corp. XRX, -4.69% jumped 20% after Credit Suisse upgraded the company to outperform.\n\nWhat Trump's North Korea tweets mean\n\nOther markets: Equities rose across the globe, with Asian markets higher after encouraging Chinese manufacturing data and European stocks building on their gains from Monday, when U.S. markets were closed for the New Year's holiday.\n\nA key dollar index DXY, +0.43% traded 1% higher while gold futures US:GCG7 settled up 0.9%.\n\nEconomic news: In the latest economic data, the Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index climbed to 54.7% in December from 53.2%. The reading was higher than expected, and the highest level in two years. Separately, a read on construction spending rose 0.9% in November, above expectations and the sixth increase of the past seven months.\n\nCheck out:MarketWatch's Economic Calendar\n\n—Victor Reklaitis contributed to this article.
Every year at this time, the financial media is filled with lists of how to be a better investor.\n\nThis got me to thinking: If these lists are so effective, why do we need a fresh set of them every year? Two answers come immediately to mind. First, investors are fickle and easily dissuaded by their emotions, compelling sales pitches and of course the ups and downs of the markets. Second, many of the items on these lists are vague and fail to tell people what they should actually do.\n\nRead: Yuck! Here are the 7 assets Wall Street hates the most for 2021\n\nIgnoring that first problem, at least for now, I'm going to propose seven steps you can take that will actually make a difference.\n\nFirst, let's look at a few common rules that aren't really useful.\n\nStarting with Warren Buffett, who is widely regarded as the best of the best investors of our era, we find this well-known prescription: Rule No. 1: Don't lose money. Rule No. 2: Don't forget Rule No. 1.\n\nSounds good, don't you think? But as a New Year's resolution, what does it mean?\n\nUnless your luck is incredibly good, any stock or fund you buy is very likely to decrease in value at some point. If you buy something for $50 a share and five minutes later its price is $49.75, have you violated this rule?\n\nWell no. If Buffett's advice really meant that, you could never buy anything.\n\nSo he must be saying you should never sell an investment at a loss. In other words, hang on forever to anything that is worth less than what you paid for it. Does that sound like a recipe for success? Buffett himself has been known to sell investments at a loss.\n\nRead: Yes, it's possible to save too much for retirement\n\nTherefore, I have to give this rule for successful investing a grade of D. Yes, it's thought-provoking, but it's not helpful.\n\nI looked at a list of 10 Key Rules of Investing from John Bogle. Many of them are good, but they fall short of being actionable instructions that tell you what to do.\n\nFor example: Don't fight the last war. What worked in the past is no predictor of what will work in the future. OK, but how is this useful? You can't know what will work in the future, so you're left to pilot a ship without a rudder.\n\nFortunately, Bogle's list includes this: Stay the course. The secret to successful investing isn't forecasting or stock picking. It is about making a plan, sticking to it, eliminating unnecessary risks, and keeping your costs low.\n\nThat's very good, but the key thing point is making a plan. What should be in that plan? Will any old plan do the job?\n\nLet's turn to Bob Farrell, who was Merrill Lynch chief market analyst and senior investment adviser for 45 years. His widely circulated rules for investors contain good insights — but they don't tell investors what they should do. Three examples:\n\n• Excesses in one direction will lead to an opposite excess in the other direction.\n\n• When all the experts and forecasts agree — something else is going to happen.\n\n• The public buys the most at the top and the least at the bottom.\n\nStill, if you are like most investors, probably 90%, what you really want to know is exactly what to do. Instructions, in other words.\n\nYou can always get instructions and recommendations from any broker. But what you really want are recommendations that will accomplish your goals, not Wall Street's goals.\n\nIf your goals include higher long-term returns, less risk, and more peace of mind, you're in the right place.\n\n1. Save some of your money regularly instead of spending everything. Start your serious savings earlier instead of later. If you can't sock away a lot, don't let that stop you. If you can save (and invest) even $25 a week, that's still $1,300 in a year, $13,000 in 10 years. Do that for 30 years and earn a compound return of 10%, and you'll have about $214,000. (And once you start seeing the results, I'm willing to bet you'll find ways to add more than just $25 a week.)\n\n2. Invest in stocks by the hundreds or thousands through low-cost index funds or ETFs in a variety of asset classes. Make sure to include value stocks and small-cap stocks. Massive diversification will reduce your risks. Indexing will almost certainly improve your return as opposed to active management. Including value stocks and small-cap stocks is highly likely to improve your long-term return.\n\n3. Pay attention to taxes. Invest in a 401(k) or similar retirement account if one is available to you — with luck, you could even get matching funds from your employer. Maximize your use of IRA accounts, and choose a Roth IRA for its long-term tax advantages.\n\n4. Ignore what you feel, and put your investments on automatic, using dollar-cost averaging. Don't let greed or fear determine when you invest. Recall Bob Farrell: The public buys the most at the top and the least at the bottom.\n\n5. If you're saving in an employee plan like a 401(k), make a target date retirement plan the backbone of your allocations. In one simple step, that will accomplish most of the things you should be doing. To increase your long-term return from this fund, allocate part of every contribution you make to an auxiliary fund such as a value fund, a small-cap blend fund, or a small-cap value fund.\n\n6. Loop back to something John Bogle and many others have recommended: Stay the course. Don't panic and don't try to time the market.\n\n7. Once you have done those six things, focus on living your life instead of obsessing about your investments. Stop watching the financial news, listening to hot tips from your friends, and reading the pundits who claim (without any evidence, as they say) to know what the future holds.\n\nIf you successfully and consistently do these things, I promise you'll be among the most successful (and probably among the least stressed) investors out there.\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nInvestors can learn some important lessons from the year that just ended, as I discuss in my latest podcast.\n\nRichard Buck contributed to this article.\n\nPaul Merriman and Richard Buck are the authors of We're Talking Millions! 12 Simple Ways To Supercharge Your Retirement.
The U.S. has reached the point where cash could be replaced almost completely with a system of electronic debits and credits. Yet the amount of dollar bills being used continues to grow, particularly bills of large denominations. There are now almost 12 billion $100 bills in circulation, up from 2 billion 20 years ago. Divided by the size of the U.S. population, those 12 billion $100 bills amount to 48 Benjamins for every American man, woman, and child.\n\nI don't remember the last time I had even one $100 bill in my wallet. Where is all this cash and why do people have it?\n\nIt has been estimated that more than half of all U.S. cash is held outside the U.S. Some of this money is held as reserves by central banks; some is used by private citizens and businesses as a second currency or as a hedge against economic instability. Much of the cash, domestically and abroad, is used for illegal or untaxed activities (the underground economy hypothesis).\n\nCash transactions are anonymous and perfect for hiding clandestine activities from the police and tax authorities. Bitcoin BTCUSD, +1.00% and other cryptocurrencies have the same appeal. Nobody with a credit card and a checking account needs to use a cryptocurrency, but people who want to buy or sell things in secret like them (which is why governments don't like them).\n\nRelated: Bitcoin and cryptocurrency on Twitter: The most important people to follow\n\nThe speculation taking place in cryptocurrencies is a completely separate issue. There is no compelling reason why a cryptocurrency could not have a fixed exchange rate, like one U.S. dollar per bitcoin, nor is there a compelling reason why the total number of bitcoins could not increase at a fixed rate, say 2% a year. A currency is a stock, a number measured at a point in time, like the number of $100 bills outstanding on December 31, 2017.\n\nTransactions are a flow, like the number of cars sold between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017. There is no fixed relationship between the two. The number of cars sold during a year does not determine how much money must be outstanding at any point during the year, or vice versa, because the money can be spent over and over during the year.\n\nRisk factors investors should look out for in 2018\n\nImagine then a new cryptocurrency, nicknamed Triplecoin, traded as an anonymous cryptocurrency with a fixed value of three U.S. dollars per Triplecoin — just as if it were a $3 bill. There would be no physical $3 bill, but this fixed exchange rate would be used as the accounting unit. You could buy 1,000 Triplecoins for $3,000 and then buy something for 1,000 Triplecoins. The seller could then use the 1,000 Triplecoins to buy something else or sell them for $3,000 to someone who wants to use Triplecoins for purchases.\n\nTriplecoins would be a shadow currency, a useful medium of exchange for people who don't want to use checks or credit cards or carry cash, and for those who want to hold U.S. dollars DXY, -0.13% as a hedge against instability in other currencies.\n\nBy contrast, the unfortunate decision by their creators to allow the value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to float versus the dollar opened the door for foolish speculation, and many gullible fools have rushed through that door. With no anchor, the price of bitcoin is whatever people are willing to pay — and what they are willing to pay today depends solely on what they think even bigger fools will be willing to pay tomorrow. When the bitcoin bubble pops, some speculators will be battered. So will the credibility of cryptocurrencies.\n\nGary Smith is the Fletcher Jones Professor of Economics at Pomona College and author of Money Machine: The Surprisingly Simple Power of Value Investing.

America's Powerball champs live in its tiniest state.\n\nResidents of Rhode Island have bought an average of 3.44 tickets per person for Powerball drawings since the last jackpot was won on Nov. 4, according to data crunched by consumer finance website ValuePenguin.\n\nThat's more than three times as many as those living in Washington state — even though winnings in that corner of the Pacific Northwest aren't subject to state income tax. Ticket sales there barely top one per resident. Connecticut and Tennessee (another tax-free state) may sell fewer per capita; the available information is not comprehensive.\n\nThe sales figures are through Wednesday, the date of the last drawing.\n\nThe data aren't broken down by drawing, but ticket sales tend to jump once a jackpot has topped $300 million without a winner, in turn pushing up the amount of potential winnings, according to Rebecca Wessell, a strategy analyst at New York City–based ValuePenguin.\n\nIf a $300 million jackpot goes unclaimed, for example, the size of the pot has climbed an average of 42% since 2002, or another $120 million, she said.\n\n No matter how may people buy tickets, the odds of nailing all six numbers stay the same: 1 in 292 million. \n\nNo one hit the jackpot in the last drawing — estimated at $500 million — on Wednesday. Since then, the estimated pot has swollen by 80%, or $400 million, to a record $900 million by midday Saturday, with almost half a day still left to buy tickets.\n\nNo matter how may people buy tickets, the odds of nailing all six numbers stay the same: 1 in 292 million. A pot is divided among how ever many winning tickets there are.\n\nTickets are sold in 44 states plus Washington, D.C.; Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Saturday's drawing will be held at 10:59 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nHere's how ticket sales break down by state. It's not clear why there's such a range; the initial reaction of a spokeswoman for Rhode Island Lottery was one of puzzlement, and Wessell suggested it could be influenced by local news coverage and marketing efforts.\n\nState taxes don't seem to be an obvious explanation; some that don't levy a tax are among those selling the most per capita, while others with the same taxation policy are toward the bottom. Nor do the numbers appear to be influenced by out-of-staters; none of the states around Rhode Island are among the six states that don't sell Powerball tickets.
The holidays were a time for celebration — but they also spawned litigation.\n\nThe New Year consistently brings batches of new lawsuits fueled by holiday revelry that goes wrong or snaps long-strained marriages, according to attorneys and experts.\n\n The Wednesday before Thanksgiving to New Year's Eve to Super Bowl Sunday the 'triangle' that makes for more than half of her 450 cases across the country. \n\nThe first month of the new year is also traditionally the time that splitting spouses act on the Auld Lang Syne lyrics asking, Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind?\n\nJanuary always seems to be the time people want to start anew and start their lives over again, said Peter Walzer, a California matrimonial lawyer practicing for 36 years. About 35% to 40% of his cases are filed in January and February, he said.\n\nU.K.-based divorce support service Amicable, said typically more than 40,500 people will search divorce online in January. The American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, says there's usually a spike in divorce filings and inquiries of 25% to 30% every year in January.\n\n 'January always seems to be the time people want to start anew and start their lives over again.'  — —Peter Walzer, a California matrimonial lawyer practicing for 36 years\n\nA twist this year already has divorce lawyers working overtime ahead of their busy season. Federal tax overhauls from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are ending the deductibility of alimony payments. As a result some lawyers across the country are scrambling to lock in divorce judgments before the new rules take effect January 1.\n\nWalzer, the current president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, says he can't convince any of his bar association colleagues to help out with organization matters right now. It's like 'call me next year.'\n\nOf course, it's not like the holidays are the most gloomiest time of the year for everyone. Many people love the holiday season. For example, 69% of participants in a 2013 Pew Research study said their favorite thing about the holidays was spending time with friends and family.\n\nSplitting Marriages\n\nLike personal injury cases, it's tricky to track the sheer number of divorce cases, which are filed in state courts. But many come around the start of the New Year, lawyers told MarketWatch.\n\nThe timing is sometimes because parents are playing nice during the holidays for their kids, or sometimes because the proverbial last straws come during a stressful time of year. Other times it's a calculation to get a clear financial picture for the task of carving up the couple's money.\n\nMost people are reacting on emotion and not tactically, said Walzer.\n\nFor pending divorces, the holidays are especially trying if there are kids and family traditions in the mix, according to Lee Rosenberg of Saltzman Chetkof & Rosenberg in New York. Fights over who gets the kids for what days get heated quick, leaving lawyers to hash out drop-off times to the exact time and location.\n\nSomething's going to go wrong and it's going to be fodder for more litigation, Rosenberg said, later adding, It becomes a quid pro quo of how bad you can be to the other person, regardless of how it affects the children.\n\nThere's some extra fuel on the fire this year, with the end of alimony being tax deductible in 2019. The federal tax code change could raise an estimated $6.9 billion for the government. But it also means the end of a tax advantage that's long been on the books.\n\nThis tax law is the biggest change in family law since I have been practicing, Walzer said.\n\nOakland, Calif.-based attorney Deborah Marx said she was burning the candle at both ends herself. Working is about all I'm doing, she said late last month. I'm not doing any work that doesn't involved these deadlines.\n\nAccountants are also feeling the burn. A recent survey from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants on the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act said over a quarter of surveyed accountants saw more clients trying to wrap up their divorces before 2019.\n\nIt's put lawyers in a frenzy and courts in a frenzy, Rosenberg said.\n\nBad weather and alcohol are a bad combination\n\nMeanwhile, research says divorce rates are falling while the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration statistics show alcohol-impaired driving is involved in fewer holiday driving fatalities.\n\nThe worst period for accidents appears to have just passed. Research shows people hospitalized in late December face increased risks for readmission or death, while another study said Christmas Eve poses a particular heart attack risk for older and sick people.\n\nHowever, Elizabeth Trendowski, an expert witness retained by plaintiffs and defendants in alcohol-fueled personal injury cases, agrees. She calls the period from the Wednesday before Thanksgiving to New Year's Eve to Super Bowl Sunday the triangle that makes for more than half of her 450 cases across the country.\n\nPeople are often off to holiday parties in December and held-over parties in January when drunk driving makes for disaster. It couldn't be more sad, she told MarketWatch.\n\nDrinking and the 'Dram Shop'\n\nDrunk driving is less of a problem than it was 30 years ago, but there was still an uptick in alcohol-related traffic crashes around the holidays, according to the NHTSA. Though there's no comprehensive data on how often those crashes lead to lawsuits, anecdotal evidence suggests the holidays fuel cases.\n\nYou see the increase, said Christopher McGrath, a New York-based personal injury attorney told MarketWatch. If there's some sort of drunk driving arrest with someone hurt, McGrath said it's a good bet a lawsuit is bound to come out of it for the driver, and possibly even the establishment that supplied the booze.\n\nBars, restaurants and other alcohol purveyors can be on the hook under so-called Dram Shop Laws. Though the burdens of proof and scopes can vary, 42 states and the U.S. Virgin Island have laws exposing watering holes to legal liability if they serve an intoxicated person who then causes mayhem on the roads or elsewhere, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\n Bars and clubs are well aware of the laws and are increasingly focused on training staff to spot drunken revelers, calm tense situations.  — —Juan Carlos Diaz, president of the American Nightlife Association, a trade association\n\nJuan Carlos Diaz, president of the American Nightlife Association, a trade association, says bars and clubs are well aware of the laws and are increasingly focused on training staff to spot drunken revelers, calm tense situations — and limit their own liability in the process.\n\nWhat's important, they're trying to do something, instead of not doing anything….Gone are the days of the roadhouse, Diaz said, citing the 1989 Patrick Swayze cult classic movie that's spilling over with barroom brawls.\n\nBut if alcohol-fueled cases are slowing in this day of ride-sharing, Trendowski, the founder of Dram Shop Forensics, says she's not seeing it. However, she only sees the cases where things go wrong, she acknowledged.\n\nHer job involves reviewing all sorts of evidence, including reports and depositions, for clues on whether bars served a visibly drunk customer. It's not always an easy call. There are times where the bar is very busy and they do communicate with somebody, but they don't exhibit the behavior until after they leave the bar, she said.\n\nTrendowski said many cases settle. I really believe a jury doesn't want to hear about drunk driving. They just don't want to hear about the drunk driver and they don't want to hear about the bar, she said.
An ugly, year-end stock-market selloff and the return of volatility has put the economic expansion, soon to be the longest on record, under the microscope. Cyclical sectors, such as housing, are slowing, as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.\n\nThe risks to the economy seem to be multiplying, from trade tensions to national security threats to a president who prefers to conduct the nation's affairs via Twitter.\n\nThe question everyone is asking is: Are the gut-wrenching ups and downs in the U.S. stock market just noise? Or is the flirtation with a bear market an early warning sign of what the U.S. economy can expect in 2019?\n\nThe Fed will be the ultimate arbiter of how things play out.\n\nIt is said that the stock market SPX, -0.16% is not the economy, and that's true. But the stock market does convey certain information and expectations about things that affect the economy, and are affected by it, such as corporate earnings. And those profit expectations have been tempered after the spectacular, double-digit gains in 2018. (Year-over-year comparisons become more challenging next year.)\n\nIn 2019 we will learn whether the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%, was truly a stimulus for productivity-enhancing capital investment or merely a stimulus for profits.\n\nBusiness fixed-investment did accelerate in the first half of 2018, rising 11.5% in the first quarter and 8.7% in the second, before reverting to a 2.5% increase in the third. A good chunk of the tax cut went to stock buybacks, which exceeded a record $1 trillion in 2018.\n\nThe U.S. economy, meanwhile, is not sending out alarm bells just yet.\n\nAvailable data point to an economy still operating near full employment. At 3.7%, the civilian unemployment rate sits at a 49-year low. Wages are finally rising at a 3% rate for the first time since the Great Recession. And consumers opened their wallets during the Christmas shopping season. The 5.1% increase in holiday sales was the biggest in the last six years, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse.\n\nThat doesn't mean the economic outlook is without risks. The sharp widening in credit spreads over the last three months, both high-yield and investment grade, seems to be mirroring the stress in the stock market.\n\nHousing, which has been a reluctant participant throughout this business cycle after overplaying its hand in the previous one, has peaked. Yet even at the high point for single-family housing starts earlier this year, builders were breaking ground on new homes at rates that paled in comparison to those of previous expansions over the last half century.\n\nGlobal synchronized growth has turned to a synchronized slowdown, which means reduced demand for U.S. goods and services. Still, the overall decline in industrial commodity prices has been less scary than the dive in energy prices since October.\n\nThe geopolitical situation is replete with opportunities for disruption and chaos.\n\nA trade war with China remains a distinct possibility. The terms of the U.K.'s exit from the European Union, or Brexit, have yet to be determined. France is dealing with anti-government street protests, triggered by an announced fuel tax, since abandoned, and a push for a higher minimum wage. Italy and the European Union, which were at loggerheads over Italy's budget, have come to some kind of an agreement that will allow Europe's fourth-largest economy to avoid sanctions for now.\n\nIn short, the liberal world order created after World War II and the institutions created to promote democratic ideals and international trade and prevent another outbreak of hostilities is being threatened by nationalist and populist movements across the globe.\n\nThe effect of any, or all, or these developments has the potential to rattle the stock market and disrupt the economic expansion. But none is as easy to identify as our own domestic provocateur, the Fed.\n\nOne of the many reasons cited for the stock market's recent jitters was the Fed's Dec. 19 rate increase and projections for additional hikes next year, along with continue balance sheet reduction.\n\nWhile the stock market was having a hissy fit, over in the fixed-income market, federal funds futures pretty much removed the likelihood of any additional rate hikes in 2019. And if there is one thing that Fed policy makers' pay attention, even cater, to, it is market expectations.\n\nBased on the December 2019 fed funds futures contract, the market is placing a greater probability on a rate cut than a rate hike by the end of the year.\n\nIf the Fed defers to the market's forecast, as it did in 2016, then it could engineer one of the rare soft landings in central bank history.\n\nIf, instead, the Fed persists is raising the funds rate to the point that it exceeds the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a recession would be the likely outcome. The average lead time for the term spread at business-cycle peaks — that is, the time between inversion and onset of recession — is 13.5-14 months, according to the Conference Board, the proprietor of the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, of which the term spread is first among equals.\n\nThe stock market seems more concerned about what the Fed says. I, for one, am content to wear earplugs but plan to monitor closely what policy makers do with the funds rate relative to the long-term rate.
British blue-chip stocks finished lower Tuesday, pulled down in part by a fall in shares of BP PLC after the energy heavyweight said it will take a $1.7 billion charge related to the Deepwater Horizon disaster.\n\nA selloff for miners also weighed on the main equity benchmark.\n\nHow markets are moving: The FTSE 100 index UKX, +0.25% fell 0.2% to close at 7,755.93, building on Monday's 0.1% decline.\n\nThe London benchmark still stands near it all-time closing high of 7,778.64, hit Friday.\n\nThe pound GBPUSD, +0.12% traded at $1.3775, slipping from $1.3782 ahead of the release of inflation data. Sterling was at $1.3794 late Monday in New York, after breaking above $1.38 earlier in that session.\n\nWhat's driving markets: Before finishing lower, the FTSE 100 wobbled in early trading, with the decline for BP shares and the drop in pound pulling in different directions.\n\nThe energy giant said it expects to book a $1.7 billion charge in its 2017 fourth-quarter results for claims related to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The company has already said it is likely to take a $1.5 billion accounting charge related to U.S. tax reform. BP shares have a weighting of 5.1% on the FTSE 100, the fourth-highest of any individual company, according to FactSet data.\n\nStock movers: BP PLC UK:BP BP, -4.00% lost 2.7% after the announcement of the Deepwater Horizon charge.\n\nRio Tinto PLC RIO, +1.79% RIO, -1.47% RIO, -1.57% said it continues to expect shipments of iron ore from its Western Australia mines will likely rise this year, after record exports in the last quarter allowed it to hit a target for 2017.\n\nBut the miner's shares closed down by 3%, as a downgrade may have hurt. HSBC analysts cut their ratings on Rio and Anglo American PLC to hold from buy, saying a recent rally has eroded the stocks' potential for further growth.\n\nAnglo AAL, +2.29% lost 1.6%, and Antofagasta PLC ANTO, +3.31% fell 2.8%.\n\nOn the upside, shares in Associated British Foods ABF, -1.83% added 2.2% following a ratings upgrade to overweight from equal weight at Barclays.\n\nAdvancers also included supermarket chain Tesco PLC TSCO, +0.18% , higher by 1.9%.\n\nEconomic data: U.K. inflation came in at 3% in December, the Office for National Statistics reported, meeting a consensus estimate from FactSet. The rate compares with a reading of 3.1% in November.\n\nAverage house prices in the U.K. rose 5.1% in November, the ONS said.\n\nWhat strategists are saying: The [inflation] data is unlikely to greatly sway the Bank of England MPC's current views, although it is sure to be monitoring the current [pound] rally, continuing to erode the Brexit inflation of the last 18 months said Mike van Dulken and Henry Croft at Accendo Markets.\n\nMore of this could see the U.K. central bank in a position to hike interest rates sooner than markets are perhaps pricing in, the analysts said in a note.
Tesla owners may be happy in 2019, even if their investors are skittish.\n\nTesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said Tesla TSLA, -4.39% faces a tough challenge of making our cars, batteries and solar products cost-competitive with fossil fuels, and that the company's products are still too expensive for most people, according to an update on the company's blog that was emailed to all employees.\n\nWhile we have made great progress, our products are still too expensive for most people, he wrote. Tesla has only been producing cars for about a decade and we're up against massive, entrenched competitors. The net effect is that Tesla must work much harder than other manufacturers to survive while building affordable, sustainable products.\n\nThere's some good news for owners, if not investors. Even after all the recent tax law changes, the federal income tax credit for qualifying new plug-in electric vehicles is still on the books. It can be worth up to $7,500. Some states offer additional incentives.\n\nHere's what you need to know to cash in along with some news:\n\nCredit basics\n\nTo be eligible for the credit, a vehicle must draw propulsion from a battery with at least four kilowatt hours of capacity; use an external source of energy to recharge the battery (thus the term plug-in); be used primarily on public streets, roads, and highways; have four wheels; meet applicable federal emission and clean air standards; and be used primarily in the U.S.\n\nDon't miss: Tesla warns on Q4 profit, cuts jobs to pull down Model 3 price\n\nIt can be either fully electric or a plug-in electric/gasoline hybrid. Finally, the vehicle must be new and be purchased for you to claim the credit. While the credit belongs to the manufacturer, if you lease an eligible vehicle, it can be factored into a lower lease payment or maybe an upfront rebate.\n\n The credit equals $2,500 for a vehicle powered by a four kilowatt-hour battery, with an additional $417 for each kilowatt hour of battery capacity beyond four hours. The maximum credit is $7,500. \n\nThe credit equals $2,500 for a vehicle powered by a four kilowatt-hour battery, with an additional $417 for each kilowatt hour of battery capacity beyond four hours. The maximum credit is $7,500. Buyers of qualifying vehicles can rely on the manufacturer's or distributor's certification of the allowable credit amount.\n\nThe credit can be used to offset your regular federal income tax liability and any alternative minimum tax (AMT) that you owe. Since there are no income restrictions, even billionaires can qualify. However, if the credit exceeds your federal income tax liability, you cannot carry the excess forward for use in future years.\n\nClaim the credit by including Form 8936 (Qualified Plug-in Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit) with your return.\n\nPhase-out rule\n\nThe credit begins phasing out for a particular manufacturer over four calendar quarters once the total number of qualifying vehicles sold by that manufacturer for use in the U.S. reaches 200,000. The IRS recently announced that Tesla had sold more than qualifying vehicles through the third quarter of 2018. So the phase-out rule is triggered for Tesla vehicles effective 1/1/19.\n\nThat means the credit for Tesla vehicles purchased between 1/1/19 and 6/30/19 is reduced to 50% of the otherwise allowable amount. For Tesla vehicles purchased between 7/1/19 and 12/31/19, the credit is reduced to 25% of the otherwise allowable amount. No credit will be allowed for Tesla vehicles purchased after 12/31/19. Source: IRS Notice 2018-96.\n\nCost-saving goodies from other sources\n\nIn some states, electric vehicle buyers can get state income-tax credits, rebates, or reduced vehicle taxes and registration fees for buying or leasing electric vehicles. For example, Colorado offers a state income-tax credit of up to $5,000 for taxpayers who buy qualified plug-in electric vehicles and up to $2,500 for lessees. New York offers a rebate of up to $2,000 to eligible buyers of plug-in vehicles. Plug In America, an advocacy group for electric cars, has a handy interactive map showing state incentives for plug-in vehicles.

What could be better?\n\nHere's a list of eligible vehicles and credit amounts\n\nDespite what you may have heard, not all eligible vehicles qualify for the maximum $7,500 credit.

American Airlines Group Inc.'s stock AAL, +2.52% surged 2.3% in premarket trade Friday, after the air carrier reported a fourth-quarter profit that rose above expectations. Earnings rose to $3.28 billion, or $5.09 a share, from $597 million, or 82 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, such as a benefit related to the reversal of a tax valuation allowance, adjusted earnings per share came to $2, above the FactSet consensus of $1.97. Revenue fell to $9.63 billion from $10.16 billion, compared with the FactSet consensus of $9.64 billion. Passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) fell 6% to 12.69 cents. Operating expenses declined 7.9%, due primarily to a 41% drop in fuel expenses. The stock has tumbled 17% over the past three months through Thursday, while the S&P 500 has lost 9.4%.
Coca-Cola Co. KO, +0.04% stock was downgraded to neutral from overweight at JPMorgan based on the risk posed by a multibillion-dollar tax court challenge the beverage giant faces.\n\nJPMorgan maintained its $55 price target.\n\nIn November 2020, the U.S. Tax Court found in favor of the Internal Revenue Service, and determined that the company owes about $3.4 billion in taxes from the years 2007 to 2009.\n\nSee: McDonald's, Shake Shack among the restaurant chains kicking off 2021 with new menu additions\n\nOn top of that, there is a risk that this amount could more than triple should the IRS apply the same tax treatment to Coca-Cola for the tax years after 2009 (about $1 billion a year for about seven years but lower post tax reform), JPMorgan JPM, +1.03% said.\n\nTwo partners at the law firm Taft summed up the issue in a December blog post.\n\nIn its simplest form, the case involved the appropriate split of profits between Coca-Cola's U.S. group and various foreign affiliates in connection with the manufacture and sale of products outside the U.S., partners Todd Lady and Jonathan Polak wrote.\n\n[I]t serves as a reminder to all companies conducting international business that the IRS has the tools and the will to enforce the 'arm's length' standard with respect to intercompany commercial activities, even where prior understandings with the IRS led to a different result.\n\nCoca-Cola announced Wednesday that it has named a counselor to the company and its board to advise on tax matters. J. Michael Luttig, a former U.S. federal judge and general counsel to Boeing Co. BA, +3.28% , will focus on the ongoing litigation.\n\nAlso: Starbucks says cold beverages have driven more than $1 billion in sales over the last three years\n\nAmerican companies cannot run their businesses with the uncertainty of the retroactive application of newly minted IRS tax policies to prior tax years that are contrary to the IRS' own previously approved policies and then be required to pay billions of dollars in unanticipated increased taxes that result from the retroactive application of these new tax policies, Luttig said in a statement.\n\nIn an abrupt departure from its established position long after the tax years in question, the IRS reversed its position, disapproved that approved methodology, required a new tax calculation methodology, and now seeks to impose a retroactive tax increase on the company for past tax years. \n\nJPMorgan calls a retroactive tax charge highly debatable, but says that Luttig's appointment is cause for concern.\n\nWe believe this tax overhang may linger into a good part of 2021, and the company may be forced to place ~$3.3bn in escrow, which would be a cash outflow, besides a potential accounting provision, the note said.\n\nDon't miss: Busiest month on record for U.K. grocers as Champagne and salmon boost Amazon partner Morrisons\n\nWhile we think Coca-Cola has strong defense arguments, we believe risks are rising.\n\nStill, analysts say Coca-Cola will come out of the coronavirus pandemic in an even stronger position, thanks to measures including the elimination of zombie brands.
Shares of Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, -2.50% shot up 3.7% in premarket trade Thursday, after the air carrier reported fourth-quarter profit and sales that beat expectations. Net income for the quarter to Dec. 31 fell to $572 million, or 80 cents a share, from $622 million, or 84 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to 96 cents, above the FactSet consensus of 88 cents. The company recognized a one-time charge of $150 million during the quarter as a result of tax reform legislation. Total revenue rose 8% to $10.25 billion, beating the FactSet consensus of $10.13 billion, amid a 7% rise in total passenger revenue and a 18% jump in other revenue. Load factor improved to 85.2% from 85.1%. Looking ahead, the company expects first-quarter total unit revenue growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. The stock has rallied 5.3% over the past three months, while the NYSE Arca Airline Index XAL, -2.61% has gained 3.3% and the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% has climbed 7.6%.
The partial government shutdown is now setting records, and investors might not be able to ignore it for much longer, analysts said.\n\nTwo key risks that we highlighted in the past (Fed's monetary policy and trade war) have subsided, but new risks have emerged: U.S. government shutdown and signs of additional slowdown outside the U.S., wrote Marko Kolanovic, global head of quantitative and derivatives strategy at JPMorgan, in a Wednesday note.\n\nRead:The government shutdown has become the longest on record\n\nHistory shows past shutdowns have had a negligible impact on stocks. So far, that's been the case with the partial shutdown that began on Dec. 21 and entered its 26th day on Wednesday with no end in sight with congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump at an impasse over his demand for funding for a $5.3 billion border wall. The closure has far exceeded the prior record, a 21-day shutdown during the Clinton administration that began in December 1995.\n\nRead:Trump on conference call with supporters: 'We'll be out [on shutdown] for a long time'\n\nSince Dec. 21, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% rallied 8% through Tuesday's close as stocks bounced back from a December selloff that took the index below 2,400 on Christmas Eve before giving way to a rebound that saw the large-cap index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.39% exit correction territory.\n\nThe rebound has been attributed in part to a softer tone from the Federal Reserve when it comes to future rate increases, efforts by China to stimulate its economy, and a relative lack of negative news surrounding the U.S.-China trade spat. But analysts and others have begun to warn that the shutdown could begin to have a negative economic impact that poses to be a drag on the market.\n\nBad things come in threes, or so goes the old saying, and the government shutdown looks like the third in a series of a policy missteps that have undermined the expansion and pushed the probability of a recession to the highest level since early 2007, said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard, in a Wednesday note, citing New York Federal Reserve Bank data.\n\nThe other missteps include the trade battle with China, which has undercut the benefits of the corporate tax cuts, and the Federal Reserve's belief that the effect on term yields from the pace of [its balance-sheet reduction] was somehow immune to a doubling of the budget deficit, he said.\n\nBlitz expects the U.S. and China will reach a lasting truce, the Fed will recalibrate the pace of its balance-sheet runoff and the government, of course, will reopen. What matters is the timing of these developments in determining how quickly markets respond before greater damage is done to the economy, he said.\n\nOthers have questioned whether the shutdown itself would be enough to affect underlying economic trends.\n\nThe White House has reportedly doubled its own estimate of the shutdown's impact on economic growth, news reports said Tuesday, forecasting it would trim first-quarter gross domestic product by 0.5 percentage points if it lasts through January.\n\nThe White House's estimates also don't allow for any negative impact through business and consumer confidence in general, which is another source of downside risk, noted Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. However, there is so far little evidence that market sentiment has suffered so far, he said, in a note.\n\nRead:Kudlow must explain to Trump that shutdown is hurting economist, says strategist\n\nThe Wall Street Journal on Wednesday reported that some senior White House officials are privately advising Trump to find a way to end the shutdown. The officials are worried that the president hasn't realized the severity of 800,000 federal workers missing paychecks, one official told the newspaper.\n\nGregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, estimated the shutdown would shave 0.2 percentage points off first-quarter GDP if it lasts through January, which would bring the firm's GDP tracker down to 1.9% annualized growth. If it lasts through the end of March, it would shave off 0.6 percentage point, slowing the pace of growth to 1.5%, he said.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who's been upbeat on the U.S. economy, warned Tuesday that the partial shutdown could wipe out growth if it lasts the entire quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, the shutdown has deprived traders, economists and policy makers of at least 10 key government data releases so far, including figures related to housing, trade and consumer spending, Daco said, adding that even when the government reopens, it will likely take months to return to a normal schedule.\n\nIf anything, this lack of data will favor an even-more cautious approach from the Fed when it comes to normalizing monetary policy. This is particularly true since the latest inflation data (which comes from the funded Bureau of Labor Statistics) shows no imminent risk of an outbreak, he said.
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey revised McDonald's Corp.'s MCD, -0.54% price target down to $187, reversing an earlier note that moved the price target to $205 from $178. [W]e overestimated the impact of tax reform on McDonald's tax rate, by mistakenly holding the foreign tax rate steady, SunTrust analysts say in the revision. We now estimate the foreign tax differential to be +3.3% vs. -4.5% prior, which increases our '18/'19 tax rate estimate to 26.1% vs. 18.3% prior, down from 32.6% in '17. Other price target moves in the earlier note include Wendy's Co. WEN, -1.91% to $22 from $17, Shake Shack Inc. to $60 from $50, and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CMG, -3.33% to $363 from $355. McDonald's shares are up 44% for the last year while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% is up nearly 25% for the period.

Don't tell the big banks that supply-side economics don't work.\n\nJ.P.Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo, the two giants that kicked off fourth-quarter earnings season Friday, are extremely different banks, but surprisingly unified on one key issue: the boost from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed in December, is just starting to boost economic growth and profits.\n\nOur expectation, as I said before, just really stepping back, is that there will be growth in the economy, said J.P. Morga JPM, +1.65% CFO Marianne Lake on a conference call with analysts. So I think you'll see the capital market space potentially react more quickly. And I think loan growth may have a bit of a lag, but never say never. So we just need to, I think, be a little patient to see some of that play out, but sentiment is strong. If the tax positions will be improved, profitability will be higher. Things that were rich before will be fairly valued. And so I think it should be all very constructive.\n\nTim Sloan, CEO of Wells WFC, +2.43% , took a more consumer-oriented approach.\n\nI mean, there have been millions of employed folks across the country that have gotten pay raises and bonuses and the like and I think that's a net positive for economic growth, Sloan told analysts. As it relates specifically to our consumer loan growth, we believe that we'll grow mortgage loans this year. We believe that we will grow credit cards this year.\n\nShares of both banks stumbled after their earnings releases, but J.P.Morgan's share price recovered and was up about 0.8% midday, while Wells shares remained 0.7% lower for the day.\n\nHere are a few other bank-specific highlights from the earnings releases.\n\nJ.P. Morgan reported per-share earnings of $1.07, versus $1.71 a year ago, but beat the FactSet consensus of $1.69. Revenue of $25.45 billion was 5% higher than the $24.33 billion booked a year ago and beat the FactSet consensus of $25.17 billion.\n\nNet interest income was up 11% to $13.4 billion, beating expectations of $13.2 billion. That—and a lower-than-expected amount of money set aside for bad loans—more than made up for higher-than-expected expenses, noted Barclays' Jason Goldberg. As widely expected, trading in fixed income, currencies and commodities slid—that segment was down 27% compared with a year ago. Trading in equities was flat.\n\nAlso as expected, the fourth-quarter results were made complicated by a one-time $2.4 billion charge stemming from the tax overhaul. With that charge stripped out, per-share earnings were up about 3% compared with the same period a year ago, and revenue was 3% higher.\n\nRead: These companies will take a huge profit hit from lower tax rates\n\nOne unexpected hiccup in the quarterly results was a $143 million loss on a margin loan made to an executive of Steinhoff International Holdings N.V., the South African company that owns MattressFirm and other interests.\n\nAs KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl speculated to MarketWatch before the earnings, banks will hold their cards close when it comes to saying how the tax cuts will guide decision-making. J.P.Morgan said repeatedly it would provide more guidance at its February investor day, but suggested those steps could impact not just employees but customers and the community, in particular lower-income borrowers.\n\nWells Fargo, meanwhile, reported EPS of $1.16, compared with 96 cents a year ago, with revenue of $22 billion. Expectations were for per-share earnings of $1.23 and revenue of $22.45 billion.\n\nThe bank was unusual among many American companies in recording a one-time benefit from the tax law, because it had a deferred tax liability, rather than a deferred tax asset. The bank said its effective tax rate in 2018 would be 19%, a meaningful decline, according to Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders.\n\nResults were lackluster, especially in terms of Well's anemic revenue performance and weaker loan growth relative to results reported today by rival JP Morgan, Sanders said.\n\nHowever, Sanders added, we believe the market had relatively low expectations for the fourth quarter. In addition, we believe investors were more focused on the future 2018 outlook in terms of cost-cutting and the new tax rate Wells will pay.\n\nAre Credit Card Companies Getting Too Cautious?\n\nWells is still weighed down by its history of consumer misdeeds. It recorded a $3.25 billion expense for regulatory investigations, the sales practices, and other matters. Pressed by one analyst, Sloan said he couldn't say for sure that ongoing investigations into those practices have determined that everything is now out in the open.\n\nThe bank's community banking division, where those misdeeds went on, saw a 34% increase in net income compared with a year ago.\n\nBarclays' Goldberg agreed. Earnings looked light, he said. He was also unimpressed with Wells' higher-than-expected expenses. Management announced plans to start significantly closing branches after resisting such a step for some time. Wells will close about 250 locations in 2018, and several hundred more by 2020.
Opioid addiction has reached epidemic proportions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 42,000 people lost their lives due to opioid use in 2016, a fivefold increase from 1999. Fueled largely by the opioid crisis, drug overdoses now represent the leading cause of death for Americans under the age of 50.\n\nThe emotional and financial havoc addiction wreaks on families is staggering. Kids from stable, loving families become addicted and will go to great lengths to get money for drugs, even stealing from their parents or other family members. Many parents of chemically addicted children grapple with anger and guilt, and often spend thousands — even hundreds of thousands — of dollars on that child's rehabilitation. Oftentimes it's the money they had set aside for retirement.\n\nFinancial advisers, who have long worked with families to help them achieve their goals, often find themselves in the middle of these difficult situations, working with parents to put into place financial safeguards that protect not only family finances but also the well-being of the relative battling addiction.\n\nGaining control through estate planning\n\nWhile abstinence and treatment are key to managing this issue on a macro level, many people will unfortunately end up in the clutches of addiction. The emotional fallout and financial turmoil wrought by addiction create ripple effects throughout families.\n\nThough often viewed as a tool exclusively for the affluent, estate plans can support all types of families and can play a number of roles beyond the financial, such as providing guardianship of minor children and protecting vulnerable adults, including those struggling with addiction.\n\nA thoughtfully designed estate plan can serve as a supportive resource if a family member's addiction has put demands on your current financial resources and on those you have earmarked for carrying out your legacy after you've passed.\n\nIncreasing accountability through an incentive trust\n\nLump sum distributions or outright bequests to a vulnerable adult in the throes of addiction can prove fatal if that person uses the funds to continue purchasing harmful substances. Yet the opposite approach of simply writing a family member out of your will and withholding the support they need can be equally devastating.\n\nTrust arrangements can help protect your assets and ensure accountability in how funds are distributed. Incentive trusts, in particular, can serve as solid compromises, as they are designed to encourage or discourage certain behaviors by using distributions of trust income or principal as an incentive.\n\nIn practical terms, this could mean that an adult beneficiary would collect distributions after meeting specified requirements, such as attending a treatment program or complying with routine drug tests. On the other hand, he or she might not receive distributions after failing to attend regular substance abuse counseling sessions.\n\nGetting the details right\n\nIncentive trusts fall within a specialized area of legal expertise, so working with an experienced attorney is crucial. A seasoned adviser can help you draft a document that is clear and definitive yet flexible enough to adapt to changing realities. It's wise to anticipate and account for a number of scenarios regarding the recovery process, chemical use triggers and the possibility of relapse.\n\nWhile incentivizing positive outcomes — for example, by adding provisions for random drug tests or employment requirements — your trust document should clearly spell out consequences for failure to adhere to the terms.\n\nThis is why you must be diligent in selecting the right trustee. The trustee is responsible for gauging adherence to the terms and making distributions from the trust, and he or she can be empowered with varying levels of discretion. This person must be willing, able and equipped to withhold distributions if the beneficiary does not meet the conditions.\n\nTrusts of this nature often require the beneficiary to agree to specific terms and provide access to health records for administration. This can mean obtaining a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) waiver to allow advisers and trustees access to health care records.\n\nCreating the trust is an important first step, but funding it properly by retitling assets in the name of the trust assures its effectiveness. While an incentive trust is clearly a complex financial instrument, the safeguards it establishes can prove to be worth the effort.\n\nKeeping the lines of communication open\n\nTalking about finances can be touchy enough, but adding addiction to those conversations can be outright taboo. But talking about these issues openly can alleviate hard feelings and financial missteps. In order to make sure everyone is on the same page, it's vital that your heirs fully understand your estate planning structure, the intent behind that structure and the physical location of key documents.\n\nSupporting a family member who is struggling with chemical dependence is a daily challenge, but aligning support after you are gone is an important responsibility. In the face of addiction, having a thoughtful estate plan in place can provide peace of mind and added assurance that your heirs will be provided for.\n\nAngie O'Leary is head of wealth planning for RBC Wealth Management - U.S.\n\nInvestment and insurance products offered through RBC Wealth Management are not insured by the FDIC or any other federal government agency, are not deposits or other obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank or any bank affiliate, and are subject to investment risks, including possible loss of the principal amount invested.\n\nRBC Wealth Management does not provide tax or legal advice.

Denny's Corp. DENN, +1.42% stock fell 3.7% in Monday premarket trading after the South Carolina-based restaurant company said fiscal fourth-quarter same store sales fell by 33%. Same-store sales were down 26% in October, 27% in November and 41% in December. The company had $82 million of total available liquidity as of Dec. 30, 2020, including cash, revolving credit facility, and liquidity covenants. Cash tax refunds of $5 million to $7 million are now expected in 2021, contrary to previous fiscal full-year 2020 guidance. Denny's plans to launch two virtual restaurant concepts focused on burgers and melts in the first half of fiscal 2021. Denny's shares have tumbled 28.8% over the past year while the benchmark S&P 500 index SPX, +0.29% is up 17.1% for the period.
Macy's Inc. M, -4.97% said Thursday that same-store sales during the months of November and December 2017 rose 1% on an owned basis and were up 1.1% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. Macy's Chief Executive Jeff Gennette says the same-store sales result sets the retailer up for a positive fourth quarter. The company saw double-digit growth online and improved holiday sales across Macy's, Macy's Backstage, Bloomingdale's and its outlet, and the beauty brand Blue Mercury. The fourth-quarter FactSet consensus is for same-store sales decline of 1.7%. Included in announced cost management efforts will be staffing adjustments, with some stores seeing reductions as others hire, and 11 store closures in early 2018. Four of those closures were previously announced. Stores will close in Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities nationwide. That brings the number of shuttered stores since 2015 to 124. Macy's expects annual expense savings to total $300 million beginning fiscal 2018, and one-time charges of $160 million, or about 33 cents per share, which will be booked in the fourth quarter. Macy's also updated its guidance, and now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share of $3.59 to $3.69 including tax reform measures, versus previous guidance of $3.38 to $3.63. The company expects same-store sales on an owned basis to decline between 2.4% and 2.7%, and a decline between 2% and 2.3% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. Sales are expected to be down between 3.6% and 3.9%. The FactSet consensus is for full-year EPS of $3.44 and a same-store sales decline of 3.4%. Macy's expects a non-cash tax benefit in fiscal 2017 of $550 million to $650 million from the federal tax rate reduction. Macy's shares are down 1.5% in Thursday premarket trading, but up 22.8% for the last three months. The S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% is up nearly 7% for the past three months.

In the wake of the mob incursion that took over the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, it's clear that many people are concerned about violence from far-right extremists. But they may not understand the real threat.\n\nThe law enforcement community is among those who have failed to understand the true nature and danger of far-right extremists. Over several decades, the FBI and other federal authorities have only intermittently paid attention to far-right extremists. In recent years, they have again acknowledged the extent of the threats they pose to the country. But it's not clear how long their attention will last.\n\nClearly the U.S. Capitol Police underestimated the threat on Jan. 6. Despite plenty of advance notice and offers of help from other agencies, they were caught totally unprepared for the mob that took over the Capitol.\n\nWhile researching my forthcoming book, It Can Happen Here: White Power and the Rising Threat of Genocide in the U.S., I discovered that there are five key mistakes people make when thinking about far-right extremists. These mistakes obscure the extremists' true danger.\n\n1. Some have white supremacist views, but others don't\n\nWhen asked to condemn white supremacists and extremists at the first presidential debate, President Donald Trump floundered, then said, Give me a name. His Democratic challenger Joe Biden offered, The Proud Boys.\n\nNot all far-right extremists are militant white supremacists.\n\nWhite supremacy, the belief in white racial superiority and dominance, is a major theme of many far-right believers. Some, like the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis, are extremely hardcore hate groups.\n\nOthers, who at times identify themselves with the term alt-right, often mix racism, anti-Semitism and claims of white victimization in a less militant way. In addition, there are what some experts have called the alt-lite, like the Proud Boys, who are less violent and disavow overt white supremacy even as they promote white power by glorifying white civilization and demonizing nonwhite people including Muslims and many immigrants.\n\nThere is another major category of far-right extremists who focus more on opposing the government than they do on racial differences. This so-called patriot movement includes tax protesters and militias, many heavily armed and a portion from military and law enforcement backgrounds. Some, like the Hawaiian-shirt-wearing Boogaloos, seek civil war to overthrow what they regard as a corrupt political order.\n\n2. They live in cities and towns across the nation and even the globe\n\nFar-right extremists are in communities all across America.\n\nThe KKK, often thought of as centered in the South, has chapters from coast to coast. The same is true of other far-right extremist groups, as illustrated by the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hate Map.\n\nFar-right extremism is also global, a point underscored by the 2011 massacre in Norway and the 2019 New Zealand mosque attack, both of which were perpetrated by people claiming to resist white genocide. The worldwide spread led the U.N. to recently issue a global alert about the growing and increasing transnational threat of right-wing extremism.\n\n3. Many are well organized, educated and social media savvy\n\nFar-right extremists include people who write books, wear sport coats and have advanced degrees. For instance, in 1978 a physics professor turned neo-Nazi wrote a book that has been called the bible of the racist right. Other leaders of the movement have attended elite universities.\n\nFar-right extremists were early users of the internet and now thrive on social media platforms, which they use to agitate, recruit and organize. The 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville revealed how effectively they could reach large groups and mobilize them into action.\n\nPlatforms like Facebook and Twitter have recently attempted to ban many of them. But the alleged Michigan kidnappers' ability to evade restrictions by simply creating new pages and groups has limited the companies' success.\n\n4. They were here long before Trump and will remain here long after\n\nMany people associate far-right extremism with the rise of Trump. It's true that hate crimes, anti-Semitism and the number of hate groups have risen sharply since his campaign began in 2015. And the QAnon movement – called both a collective delusion and a virtual cult – has gained widespread attention.\n\nBut far-right extremists were here long before Trump.\n\nThe history of white power extremism dates back to slave patrols and the post-Civil War rise of the KKK. In the 1920s, the KKK had millions of members. The following decade saw the rise of Nazi sympathizers, including 15,000 uniformed Silver Shirts and a 20,000-person pro-Nazi rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City in 1939.\n\nWhile adapting to the times, far-right extremism has continued into the present. It's not dependent on Trump, and will remain a threat regardless of his public prominence.\n\n5. They pose a widespread and dire threat, with some seeking civil war\n\nFar-right extremists often appear to strike in spectacular lone wolf attacks, like the Oklahoma City federal building bombing in 1995, the mass murder at a Charleston church in 2015 and the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting in 2018. But these people are not alone.\n\nMost far-right extremists are part of larger extremist communities, communicating by social media and distributing posts and manifestos.\n\nTheir messages speak of fear that one day, whites may be outnumbered by nonwhites in the U.S., and the idea that there is a Jewish-led plot to destroy the white race. In response, they prepare for a war between whites and nonwhites.\n\nThinking of these extremists as loners risks missing the complexity of their networks, which brought as many as 13 alleged plotters together in the planning to kidnap Michigan's governor.\n\nTogether, these misconceptions about far-right extremist individuals and groups can lead Americans to underestimate the dire threat they pose to the public. Understanding them, by contrast, can help people and experts alike address the danger, as the election's aftermath unfolds.\n\nAlexander Hinton is the Distinguished Professor of Anthropology and director of the Center for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights at Rutgers University – Newark. This was first published by The Conversation — US Capitol mob highlights 5 reasons not to underestimatefar-right extremists.
The big story for investors in 2017 was the broad-based rally in stocks. Simply by owning equities of any shape or size, you likely made out very nicely.\n\nDomestic large-cap stocks were up about 20% as measured by the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% . Other markets did even better, with broad global funds like the Vanguard Total International ETF VXUS, -1.17% up about 25% and the popular iShares FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index ETF FXI, -0.89% up about 37%.\n\nAnd if you didn't like stocks there was always bitcoin BTCUSD, +1.00% . The cryptocurrency soared a staggering 15-fold over 2017.\n\nAmid this risk-on rally, many investors likely overlooked gold US:GCG8.\n\nHowever, 2018 is increasingly shaping up to look like a breakout year for the precious metal. Here's why:\n\nA new floor: From a technical perspective, gold hasn't looked this good in a long time. The precious metal has touched $1,350 an ounce a few times over the past few years and has been pretty stable between $1,200 and $1,250 since the last test of those highs back in September. We've yet to break out to the upside, but a clear pattern of higher lows is an incredibly encouraging sign that we've found a new floor for prices. And with recent moves up through the important round number of $1,300, there's a good chance we keep powering higher.\n\nRisk factors investors should look out for in 2018\n\nShort-term momentum: Beyond this base, there's encouraging momentum. Gold prices GLD, -0.58% are up roughly 6% in the last six months, which underperforms a gain of 11% for the S&P 500 but is still noteworthy. And since rolling back in early December, gold has surged more than 5% in just a few weeks while the S&P has barely budged.\n\nAsset rotation: Many stock-market investors are still optimistic after a great run in 2017, but it's undeniable that many traders are ready for what's next now that tax reform is priced in and the big run for equities looks long in the tooth. It's natural for the fast money to look for greener pastures when we've had a good run, and the turn of the year is a great excuse to move out of stocks and into something else.\n\nStrong global demand: Aside from the charts and asset rotation, there is structural demand that will provide a lift for gold. For starters, look at India, where gold imports surged an amazing 67% in 2017. The nation is the No. 2 consumer gold market in the world behind China, so that's an encouraging sign of retail demand. As for China, demand for gold bars through November was up 40% from a year earlier, according to gold portal Kitco. That speaks to strong momentum.\n\nWeak production: Across 2017, gold mining GDX, -1.72% was incredibly anemic, prompting a report from ANZ that noted gold output was at its lowest point since the financial crisis, with risks only getting greater. There are a host of factors at play, from cash-strapped companies like Freeport McMoRan FCX, -1.91% closing underperforming sites to new regulatory policies for miners in Indonesia and South Africa. But the collective result is less gold coming out of the ground, which should benefit gold investors in 2018.\n\nEverything we thought about millennials' money habits was wrong\n\nSoft dollar: There's an inverse relationship between the strength of commodity prices and U.S. currency, since these raw materials are priced in dollars. However, the trend lately is not for a strong dollar but a weak one. In fact, the U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.13% just hit a three-month low. And this after the benchmark measure for the dollar declined almost 10% during 2017. This currency dynamic creates yet an additional tailwind for gold prices.\n\nCryptocurrencies can't compete: Lest you think the crypto craze sapped demand for gold, it's important to remember that the nice appreciation for the precious metal in 2017 came even amid bitcoin's big run. This shows resilience even as other alternative assets gain investor attention. Furthermore, even after the Cboe launched bitcoin futures in late 2017, Goldman Sachs reported no discernible outflow of gold as traders and institutional investors were given another fashionable way to play the crypto market. Gold is a haven for a reason, and no fashionable asset craze can change that.
Dear Moneyologist,\n\nMy 20-year-old daughter has been living with a 24-year-old man for the last year, and has just announced their engagement. My wife and I do not approve of their cohabitation or intended marriage, because we have deep concerns about the character of this man. Ever since she met him, she cut all meaningful and emotional ties with her family and many friends. I find him to be repulsive, and lacking the basic courage to meet with me man-to-man when I recently invited him to lunch to try and start a dialogue. They asked for our approval to get married over the Thanksgiving holiday, which I refused to give based on their behavior and lifestyle choices over the past two years, which my wife and I have found so disrespectful and hurtful.\n\nMy wife and I are seeking professional counseling to help us walk this difficult road of trying to be supportive of our daughter while being totally against what we see as a controlling and manipulative relationship. We recognize there is nothing we can do to stop them from making and learning from their choices, as we all do eventually. But I don't have to reward their decision with a financial gift upon my passing either. I intend to alter my will to exclude my daughter from receiving any portion of my estate, unless she is no longer married or living with this man. I may, however, include some financial gifts for any future grandchildren in the form of college funds or IRAs. I don't want any part of my estate to go to, or be in control of, this coward and thief she wants to marry. What say you?\n\nName withheld\n\nDear Husband/Father,\n\nThe Moneyologist says you can do anything you want with your money.\n\nWithout knowing any of the parties, I would have to say that there are two potentially controlling people in this situation: There is the man who may or may not be usurping some or all of your daughter's time and there is the man who wants to punish her for making this choice. On this basis, your daughter is drawn to characteristics that may be all-too familiar. If you cannot make her pay for marrying this man while you are alive, you will do so after you are gone. You may not like him, you may never like him, but you will lose your daughter if you continue to insist that she does as you wish. She is 20 years old. She will make mistakes.\n\nHave you made the extent of your feelings known? If so, you have helped to create an environment where this man — himself only 24 — is more likely to decline your invitation to talk. Typically, invitations are issued in the spirit of goodwill. You want him to acknowledge you. Yet you have called him repulsive, a coward and a thief. They're strong words. He may be these things or it may be that you feel like he has stolen your daughter's affections or, indeed, your daughter. But a thief is someone who walks into a bank and asks the teller to hand over the money — not asks for the hand of the woman he loves.\n\nThe intersection of hurt feelings and financial penalties are never pretty. I recently received this letter from a man who chose to issue a letter to his children on Thanksgiving announcing the end of an annual cash gift because (a) he felt one of his children lacked fiscal responsibility and (b) he believed his daughter-in-law tithed too much money to church.\n\nRead: Should my daughter elope or have a big wedding?\n\nResponses were mixed at his actions. But the solution worked for him and I supported him in that decision. In that case, he treated all of his children equally. (I haven't heard back how that Thanksgiving dinner went.) Another woman wrote to say that her mother was giving her sister too much money. Yet another man wondered if he should divide his father's estate or keep it (as his siblings were excluded from the will).\n\nWhether or not you learn to accept your daughter on her own terms — and vice-versa — it's probably a good idea to think about any future grandchildren's education and retirement accounts. That's forward thinking and generous of you. Setting up trusts for them and depositing money in those trusts on a yearly basis (up to $14,000 in 2015 without having to file a gift tax return, although there is a gift tax exclusion for education) would also reduce the size of your estate and the taxes that will fall due upon your death. In the meantime, if she marries this man and you receive an invitation, don't do what he did. Lay down your arms (and last will and testament) and walk her down the aisle. Not being there for a family member's wedding could end this father-daughter relationship.\n\nThere is no easy solution here. It gets trickier to maintain control over other parts of your estate if you deed it to relatives. For instance, leaving property to your grandchildren or daughter would be more complicated than merely setting up a trust, says Brandon Bellew, a lawyer in Clearwater, Fla. If you deeded it to your grandchildren, your daughter would be guardian over this asset if her children were minors when you passed away. If you left your home to your daughter, it could be deemed marital property, depending on the laws of her particular state. In other words, it could belong to both your daughter and her husband, regardless. Like people, the law can be stubborn and refuse to bend to our will.\n\nA psychologist once told me that over control leads to lack of control. That was in relation to a jar of cookies. But I think the same principle applies here, too.\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, regifting, or any tricky money issues relating to family and friends? Send them to MarketWatch's Moneyologist.
DAVOS, Switzerland--Google said late Friday that it has struck a deal with the U.K.'s tax authority that will settle a tax dispute and boost its future taxes in Britain, part of a broader effort by European governments to wring more corporate tax from big firms in the tech sector.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Google will pay £130 million ($185 million) in back taxes and interest covering the years 2005-15. The company also committed to paying taxes based in part on the revenue it brings in from U.K.-based advertisers, a move that will boost its tax payments in Britain--the company's second-largest market after the U.S.
All three main equity benchmarks posted record gains on Friday to end the first week of 2018 on a stellar footing, marked by four straight positive session, following lackluster jobs data.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% rose 220.74 points, or 0.9%, to 25,295.87. The S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% closed up 19.16 points, or 0.7%, at 2,743.15. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% gained 58.64 points to 7,136.56, a gain of 0.8%.\n\nFriday's rally meant that none of the equity indexes have posted a down day so far in 2018. For the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, it was the fourth straight closing record, while the Dow carved out its third in a row. The broad-market benchmark has closed at a record on the first four trading days of the new year, the first time it has done so since 1964, according to WSJ Market Data Group.\n\nFor the week, the Dow rose 2.3%, the S&P 500 gained 2.6%, while the Nasdaq is up 3.4%. The Dow notched the biggest weekly gain since the period ended Dec. 1, 2017, the S&P 500 recorded its best weekly rise since Nov. 11, 2016, and the Nasdaq logged its best climb over the same period since Dec. 9., 2016.\n\nThe small-cap focused Russell 2000 index RUT, -2.94% and the Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, -0.07% also closed at all-time highs.\n\nWhat drove the market?\n\nThe gains over the week have been buoyed by the recently passed corporate tax-cut package, rising commodity prices, and robust corporate earnings. Solid economic data and low bond yields have also been cited as contributing factors.\n\nDow Hits 25000: Here's Why It Matters\n\nWhat the data are saying?\n\nThe U.S. created 148,000 jobs in December. This was the slowest pace in three months, and below the 198,000 increase that economists polled by MarketWatch had predicted. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.1% for the third straight month. Worker pay increased 2.5% from December 2016 to December 2017, up from 2.4% in the prior month.\n\nSeparately, the U.S. trade deficit widened 3.2% in November to $50.5 billion, the highest trade gap since January 2012. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a $50 billion gap.\n\nIn other economic news on Friday, the Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing index sank 1.5 points to 55.9% in December. U.S. factory orders rose 1.3% in November, a faster pace than had been expected, and the fourth straight monthly increase. A reading of 50 or better signifies improving activity.\n\nWhat are strategist saying?\n\nThe jobs report is a market-friendly number, in that it is good but not overheated. Investors should interpret this as Fed-friendly, in that the central bank will remain interested in the economy but not get overly aggressive in raising rates in 2018, said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.\n\nWhile it came in below expectations, it wasn't sufficiently weak for investors to feel they should sell. Single months of data can be lumpy, but the average over the past few months shows that the labor market remains strong.\n\nFed speakers\n\nPhiladelphia Fed President Patrick Harker on Friday said he thinks the U.S. central bank will only raise interest rates twice this year, one fewer than the Fed's median forecast of three increases in 2018.\n\nFed President of Cleveland Loretta Mester told CNBC on Friday that the jobs report was strong and that she could foresee three or four rate increases in 2018. I think we're basically at maximum employment from the view of monetary policy, she said.\n\nWhich stocks were in focus?\n\nThe day's gains were broad, with seven of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors higher on the day. Tech shares were among the biggest gainers, up 1.2%, which helped to lift the broader Nasdaq, which has a heavy weighting to the sector. Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -2.67% rose 1.2%, while Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -2.92% , the parent company of Google, added 1.3%.\n\nApple Inc. AAPL, -3.39% rose 1.1%. The technology giant published information late Thursday that confirmed that all devices running its mobile and personal-computer operating systems are affected by two massive computer chip vulnerabilities.\n\nSpirits-and-beer company Constellation Brands Inc. STZ, -0.83% fell 2.6% after it reported sales that came in below analyst forecasts.\n\nU.S.-listed shares of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV US:FCAU gained 6.4% after J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. upgraded the car maker to overweight from neutral.\n\nShares of Cal-Maine Foods Inc. CALM, +1.33% dropped 6.9% after the company missed earnings estimates for its fiscal second quarter.\n\nAveXis Inc. US:AVXS finished down 2.5% in volatile trading. The gene-therapy company said late Thursday it was preparing to respond to Food and Drug Administration information requests about AveXis's primary gene therapy, which would be used to treat a form of spinal muscular atrophy.\n\nCellect Biotechnology Ltd. APOP, -1.93% rose 1.8% a day after announcing breakthrough results in a clinical trial, although the results were for just three patients.\n\nKala Pharmaceuticals Inc. KALA, -4.13% tumbled nearly 30% in heavy trading after it released results from two late-stage trials for its dry eye therapy KPI-121.\n\nWhat did the markets do?\n\nAsian stock markets continued to power higher, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index NIK, -1.41% ending at a 26-year high.\n\nIt was a similar story in Europe, where the Stoxx Europe 600 index SXXP, +0.40% rose 0.6%.\n\nThe dollar recorded its third weekly loss, but the ICE dollar index DXY, -0.13% finished slightly higher up 0.1% at 91.975.\n\nCrude-oil prices US:CLG8 retreated from a three-year high, settling at $61.44 a barrel, but posted a third straight weekly gain, while gold futures US:GCG8 settled higher at $1,322.30 an ounce, and marked its longest win streak, 11 straight sessions, in history.
The number of confirmed global cases of the coronavirus-borne illness COVID-19 climbed above 91 million on Tuesday, and the U.S. case tally headed toward 23 million, as three Democratic lawmakers who were forced to shelter in place during last week's attack on the Capitol tested positive for the virus.\n\nReps. Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey, Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Brad Schneider of Illinois said they believe their diagnoses are a direct result of being crowded into small rooms during the siege with colleagues who did not wear face masks, the Associated Press reported. Experts have worried that the lockdown at the Capitol would become a superspreader event.\n\nSchneider tweeted that that he was worried he may be risking his wife's health, and blasted the Republican lawmakers who adamantly refused to wear a mask, even when politely asked to do so by their colleagues.\n\nThe rioting mob are expected to have created a separate superspreader event as most of the people who were televised roaming around the corridors were not wearing face masks, as Dr. Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told McClatchy.\n\nI do think you have to anticipate that this is another surge event, Redfield said in an interview with the newspaper group. You had largely unmasked individuals in a non-distanced fashion, who were all through the Capitol.\n\nThe U.S. added at least 222,902 new cases on Monday, according to a New York Times tracker, and at least 2,048 people died. The U.S. has averaged 250,721 cases a day for the past week.\n\nThere are currently 129,748 COVID-19 patients in U.S. hospitals, according to the COVID Tracking Project, just below the record of 132,464 set on Jan. 6. The U.S. continues to lead the world by cases, at 22.6 million, and deaths, at 377,616, or about a fifth of the global toll, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nOn the vaccine front, the CDC's tracker shows that as of 9.00 a.m. ET Monday, almost 9 million Americans had received a jab, and 25.5 million doses had been distributed, lagging early targets.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has left it to states to administer the vaccine program, meaning that stressed state health departments, which have already had to deal with testing, contact tracing, public information campaigns and deciding when or whether schools or businesses should be open or closed, are now tasked with handling the biggest public health effort in decades.\n\nHealth and Human Services Alex Azar announced two major changes to the program on Tuesday, the AP reported. First, the government will no longer hold back required second doses of the Pfizer -BioNTech PFE, -0.11% BNTX, -1.33% and Moderna vaccines, practically doubling supply.\n\nSecond, states should immediately start vaccinating other groups lower down the priority scale, including people age 65 and older, and younger people with certain health problems. The news comes days after President-elect Joe Biden said he would distribute vaccines immediately.\n\nA Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of the program published by the nonprofit health-care think tank on Monday found that while all 50 states are vaccinating health care workers and long-term care residents first, as recommended by the CDC's independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), at least 16 are allowing other groups to be vaccinated simultaneously.\n\nStates are not obliged to follow the ACIP's recommendations, but are being encouraged to do so as it gives them a science-based framework to follow that can ultimately help end the pandemic more swiftly.\n\nOverall, we find states are increasingly diverging from CDC guidance and from each other, suggesting that access to COVID-19 vaccines in these first months of the U.S. vaccine campaign may depend a great deal on where one lives, the analysis found. In addition, timelines vary significantly across states, regardless of priority group, resulting in a vaccine rollout labyrinth across the country.\n\nRead now:The majority of states aren't following the CDC's coronavirus vaccination distribution recommendations\n\nMeanwhile, a World Health Organization official said that she doesn't expect to see herd immunity to the coronavirus in 2021 even as mass vaccinations in some countries are already rolling out.\n\nDr. Soumya Swaminathan, the WHO's chief scientist, also urged continued use of public-health mitigation practices, which include mask wearing and social distancing.\n\nWe have to be a little bit patient, she said during a media briefing. The vaccines are going to come...[but] we're not going to achieve any levels of population immunity or herd immunity in 2021 and even if it happens in a couple of pockets, in a few countries, it's not going to protect people across the world.\n\nIn other news:\n\n• The U.S. government will require all international airline passengers to provide proof of a negative test for the coronavirus-borne illness COVID-19 before boarding a flight, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The order may come from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as early as today, the paper reported. Officials from federal agencies and the White House Task Force have been discussing the move for weeks. It is expected to come into effect on Jan. 26.\n\n• Moderna Inc. MRNA, -5.43% expects its COVID-19 vaccine to provide immunity to the virus for at least a year, according to remarks made by a company executive at an investor conference on Monday, MarketWatch's Jaimy Lee reported. Moderna developed one of the two authorized COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. The company is tracking antibodies in participants in its Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials to better understand what level of antibodies are needed to be protected against infection with the coronavirus. Our expectation is that the vaccination should last you at least a year to the degree that you need a booster shot, the executive said. Separately, Moderna's vaccine was granted emergency use authorization in Switzerland, which has agreed to purchase 7.5 million doses. Ride-sharing company Uber said it will work with Moderna to find ways to support the update of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n• Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California will host a super COVID-19 vaccination site, CNN reported. The resort is expected to become one of several such massive sites where thousands of residents will be able to be dosed. The resort is expected to be up and running later this week. More super POD sites will be announced as agreements are finalized, officials said.\n\n• Germany's strict lockdown could last for another eight to 10 weeks, the Guardian reported. Health officials are worried about the spread of a new variant from the U.K. that is up to 70% more infectious than the original virus. Chancellor Angela Merkel told a working group in her party that cases could increase 10-fold by Easter if more is not done now to contain the spread. Germany has had 1.9 million confirmed cases of the virus, and at least 41,917 people have died, according to the Johns Hopkins data.\n\n• China has locked down 4.9 million people in the city of Langfang as new infections raised concerns about a second wave in the country that has mostly contained the virus, Reuters reported. The National Health Commission reported 55 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, down from 103 a day earlier. Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, accounted for 40 of the 42 locally transmitted infections, with the capital and northeastern Heilongjiang province reporting one local case each.\n\nSee:These COVID-19 tax relief measures just got extended\n\nStudents Share Lessons From Their Virtual 2020\n\nLatest tallies\n\nThe number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide climbed above 91 million on Tuesday, the Johns Hopkins data show, and the death toll rose above 1.95 million. About 50 million people have recovered from COVID-19.\n\nBrazil has the second highest death toll at 203,580 and is third by cases at 8.1 million. India is second worldwide in cases with 10.5 million, and third in deaths at 151,327.\n\nMexico has the fourth highest death toll at 134,368 and 13th highest case tally at 1.5 million.\n\nThe U.K. has 3.1 million cases and 82,098 deaths, the highest in Europe and fifth highest in the world.\n\nChina, where the virus was first discovered late last year, has had 97,001 confirmed cases and 4,793 deaths, according to its official numbers.\n\nWhat's the economy saying?\n\nSmall-business owners turned more pessimistic in December than they have been at any time since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic after a record new stage of the viral outbreak and Democratic electoral victories that promise a potentially dramatic shift in economic policy in Washington, MarketWatch's Jeffry Bartash reported.\n\nThe closely followed optimism index compiled by the National Federation of Independent Business fell by 5.5 points to 95.9 last month, marking its lowest level since last May.\n\nRead:The bad news keeps coming for the economy, but it might not be as bad as it looks\n\nThis month's drop in small-business optimism is historically very large, and most of the decline was due to the outlook of sales and business conditions in 2021, said NFIB chief economist Bill Dunkelberg.\n\nJust two months ago, the index topped 104 as it returned near a pre-crisis high.
 'The difference between my socialism and Trump's socialism is I believe the government should help working families, not billionaires.' \n\nThat's presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders responding on Fox News Sunday to President Trump calling him a communist.\n\nObviously, I am not a communist, Sanders told host Chris Wallace, adding that Trump maybe doesn't know the difference and is a pathological liar.\n\nRead:More than a third of millennials polled approve of communism\n\nWallace also asked Sanders about his socialist agenda and whether America's ready to embrace Medicare for All and the Green New Deal.\n\nIn many respects, we are a socialist society today, Sanders said, hitting Trump for tax breaks and subsidies he received before he was in the White House.\n\nIf we leave the status quo alone, in the next 10 years we're going to be spending $50 trillion, he said. Medicare for All will cost the average American less than the $12,000 a year they are paying the insurance companies.\n\nWatch the full interview:
LONDON—In August 2014, when the housing market here was on a tear, a two-bedroom condominium in one of the most expensive neighborhoods went up for sale at £3.25 million ($4.64 million), a 67% premium to its purchase price six months earlier.\n\nThe redbrick home on Cadogan Gardens in Knightsbridge is still unsold, and expectations have been revised. The price has been cut three times, the latest at the start of this year, to £2.5 million.
Cannabis stocks rallied anew on Thursday, with the Cannabis ETF on track for its biggest weekly gain since March of 2020, as hopes the Democrat's victory in the Georgia Senate run-off will spur the reforms needed to allow the legal sector to flourish.\n\nThe Democratic Party will now effectively control the House, the Senate and the White House, which could pave the way for a number of pro-cannabis initiatives that have been bottlenecked in the House of Representatives to begin working their way through applicable political/legislative channels, Canaccord analysts wrote in a note.\n\nThe legislation most likely to find its way back to the House is the MORE Act, or Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment and Expungement Act, which seeks to decriminalize cannabis at the federal level. The House voted in favor of the bill in December, but it was not expected to find favor in the then-Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nThe MORE Act also seeks to bolster social justice reforms and expunge criminal convictions for nonviolent cannabis-related offenses, while offering the states the chance to govern their own policies.\n\nAlthough the Act will need to be reintroduced, as soon-to-be Vice President Kamala Harris originally co-introduced this bill into the House, we believe the prospect of it now moving to the Senate and eventually being brought into law is significantly improved due to the results of Wednesday's Senate elections, said the Canaccord analysts.\n\nRead now: Tilray stock soars after reverse merger deal with Aphria, to create largest global cannabis company\n\nThere are also increased hopes for passage of the SAFE Banking Act—or Secure and Fair Enforcement Act, a bill that sought to allow cannabis companies access the federally insured banking system and capital markets without the risk of federal enforcement action.\n\nThat bill was passed in the House back in September of 2019, but failed to gain traction in the Senate.\n\nThen there is the Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States Act, or States Act, a bill that seeks protections for businesses and individuals in states that have legalized who comply with state laws.\n\nSee: As pot stocks boom on hopes for U.S. legalization, Canadian cannabis companies struggle for growth\n\n The value creation potential in US cannabis is a generational wealth opportunity, said Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett in a note.\n\nThere was more good news for the sector when New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo unveiled his latest plan to legalize cannabis in the Empire State, an effort that has been attempted every year for the last several, only to be thwarted by a failure for lawmakers to agree on social equity measures.\n\nCuomo said he is aiming to create a system to oversee and regulate cannabis as part of his 2021 State of the State. The governor is proposing to create an Office of Cannabis Management that would be tasked with managing a new adult-use program, alongside existing medical and cannabinoid hemp programs.\n\nThe program would include licensing opportunities and assistance for communities of color who have suffered disproportionately during the U.S.'s yearslong War on Drugs. Cuomo estimates New York could generate more than $300 million in tax revenue, much needed income given the devastation the state budget has suffered during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Cannabis ETF THCX, +0.88% was last up 4.4%. Among individual stocks, U.S.-listed shares of Aurora Cannabis Inc. ACB, +1.44% ACB, +1.54% , the most widely held stock on the Robinhood trading app, were up 0.1%. Tilray Inc.

In an earlier column, I summarized the most important changes in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) for small and medium-sized businesses. This column covers some less-publicized, but still-important, changes that can affect businesses and their owners.\n\nNew credit for employer-paid family and medical leave\n\nFor wages paid in tax years beginning after 12/31/17 and before 1/1/20, the TCJA allows employers to claim a tax credit equal to 12.5% of wages paid to qualifying employees while they are on family or medical leave — as long as the employee is paid at least 50% of his or her normal wage while on leave. The credit rate is increased by 0.25% for each percentage point that the wage rate paid while on leave exceeds 50% of the normal rate. However, the maximum credit rate is 25%. Finally, to be eligible for the credit, the employer must give all qualifying full-time employees at least two weeks of annual paid family and medical leave. Part-time employees must be given proportional leave time.\n\nFaster depreciation for some real estate\n\nFor property placed in service after 12/31/17, the separate definitions of qualified leasehold improvement property, qualified restaurant property, and qualified retail improvement property are eliminated. Under the TCJA, they are now lumped together under the description of qualified improvement property, which can be depreciated straight-line over 15 years. Under prior law, such property generally had to be depreciated over 39 years, which is a long, long, time.\n\nFaster depreciation for new farming machinery and equipment\n\nThe TCJA shortens from seven to five years the depreciation period for new machinery and equipment that is placed in service after 12/31/17 and used in a farming business (other than grain bins, cotton ginning assets, fences, or other land improvements).\n\nJeff Bezos's vast wealth has reached uncharted territory\n\nLess-favorable treatment for carried interests\n\nPrivate equity funds and hedge funds have historically been structured as limited partnerships. Under prior law, so-called carried interest arrangements allowed private equity fund and hedge fund managers to give up their right to receive current fees for their services and instead receive an interest in future profits from the private equity/hedge fund partnership. These arrangements are often called carried interests because the private equity/hedge fund manager doesn't pay anything for the partnership profits interest. Also, the private equity/hedge fund manager is not taxed on the receipt of the carried interest because it's not considered a taxable event.\n\nThe tax planning objective of carried interest arrangements is to trade current fee income that would immediately be treated as high-taxed ordinary income and be subject to federal employment taxes for a partnership profits interest that is expected to generate future long-term capital gains that will be taxed at lower rates. Nice. You can see why this ultra-favorable tax treatment of carried interests is controversial.\n\nFor tax years beginning after 2017, the TCJA imposes a three-year holding period requirement in order for profits from certain partnership interests received in exchange for the performance of services to be treated as low-taxed long-term capital gains rather than higher-taxed ordinary income. That's an improvement.\n\nSelf-created intangibles no longer qualify for capital gains tax rates\n\nEffective for dispositions in 2018 and beyond, the TCJA stipulates that certain intangible assets can no longer be treated as favorably-taxed capital gain assets. This change affects inventions; models and designs (whether or not patented); secret formulas; and processes that are: (1) created by the taxpayer or (2) acquired from the creating taxpayer with the new owner's basis determined by the creating taxpayer's basis (such as an acquisition by gift or by contribution by the creating taxpayer to another entity such as a corporation or partnership).\n\nPartnership/LLC technical termination rule eliminated\n\nUnder prior law, a partnership (or an LLC treated as a partnership for tax purposes) was terminated for federal income tax purposes if, within a 12-month period, there was a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the partnership's (LLC's) capital and profits interests. This so-called technical termination rule is generally unfavorable because: (1) it can require the filing of two short-period tax returns for the tax year in which the technical termination occurs, (2) it restarts the depreciation periods for the partnership's (LLC's) depreciable assets, and (3) it terminates favorable tax elections that were made by the partnership (LLC). Thankfully, the TCJA repeals the technical termination rule, effective for partnership (LLC) tax years beginning in 2018 and beyond.
The U.S. dollar on Tuesday traded firmly higher against its main rivals, extending gains from the last three months of 2016 after stronger-than-expected manufacturing data added to the buck's uptrend.\n\nThe ICE dollar index DXY, +0.43% jumped 1% to 103.27 as the greenback rose against most other major currencies. The gauge is touching levels last seen in 2002, according to FactSet data.\n\nThe ISM manufacturing index rose to 54.7% in ​December. A reading of 50 or greater points to expansion. Meanwhile, construction spending rose 0.9%, with both reports coming in stronger than forecast by economists polled by MarketWatch.\n\nThe dollar rally is being driven by enormous investor expectations that the relatively strong U.S. economy will accelerate even further under the leadership of [President-elect] Donald Trump who is expected to stoke growth through fiscal stimulus and deregulation, said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management. The dollar has risen 4.6% over the last quarter on prospects of rising inflation and interest rates.\n\nIndeed, the dollar index ended 3.6% higher in 2016, marking its fourth straight year of gains.\n\nWhat is the future of bitcoin?\n\nThe dollar traded sideways late December, but gained 4.6% over the fourth quarter on expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates at a more rapid clip than had previously been expected. The market is pricing in two rate increases in 2017, according to CME Group data, while the Fed's projection of rate increases this year, its so-called dot plot, implies three moves, an increase from its earlier projection in September of two rate increases this year.\n\nThe last two weeks in December were clearly a pause in the dollar rally and investors continue to bet on a stronger dollar in 2017, said Neil Mellor, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon.\n\nMr. Trump's policies will take months to be put into effect, but in the meantime the markets will need to key off the U.S. data. Given the very high expectations, the possibility of disappointment is high, Schlossberg added.\n\nMeanwhile, the euro EURUSD, -0.01% fell to its lowest level in nearly 14 years, but regained footing in late trade. The shared currency was changing hands at $1.0407 late Tuesday in New York, compared with $1.0467 late Monday in New York.\n\nSome analysts expect more potential downside risk for the euro in 2017, which could pull it down to parity with the greenback.\n\nOver the past decade China has diversified its foreign holdings away from the dollar and into the euro. The recent devaluation of the yuan forced them to sell their dollars, but soon, they might start selling their euros, further putting pressure on the single currency, said Mellor.\n\nMellor noted that the weakness in the euro and the yen is a positive for their respective central banks.\n\nThe ECB and [Bank of Japan] are only happy to see the dollar strengthen to allow their economies to recover. But it has a negative impact on emerging markets and the Fed will be very careful not to let the dollar strengthen too much, Mellor said. One of the risks for the dollar is the Fed tightening too soon too much, he said.\n\nThe yen USDJPY, +0.08% also slid, with the dollar fetching ¥117.71 late Tuesday in New York, up from ¥117.41 on Monday.\n\nIn other currencies, the pound jumped after the U.K. manufacturing purchasing managers index for December soared to a 30-month high. Sterling GBPEUR, -0.05% bought €1.1757, up from €1.1739, its strongest level against the euro since Dec. 22, according to FactSet.\n\nThe pound GBPUSD, -0.04% changed hands at $1.2235 late Tuesday in New York, compared with $1.2287 on Monday.\n\nAmong emerging-market currencies, the Russian ruble USDRUB, +0.06% strengthened as much as 1.3% against the dollar, largely thanks to a jump in oil prices. But as oil turned its 2.5% gain into 2.7% decline, the ruble gave up gains, with the dollar fetching 60.9875 rubles late Tuesday in New York, down from 61.2465.\n\nAnd the Turkish lira USDTRY, +0.00% plunged to new lows after a terrorist attack on a night club on New Year's Eve as well as rising inflation. Official data showed inflation rose 8.5% in December, up from 7% in November. The dollar bought 3.5960 lira, up from 3.5436 a day earlier.
It's a good bet that most of Donald Trump's news conference Wednesday will focus on that dossier of unverified allegations surrounding ties to Russia that the president-elect has dismissed as a total political witch hunt.\n\nCheck out: A live blog of Trump's news conference\n\nWall Street is so far shrugging off the latest chapter of the Russia saga. Stocks traded modestly higher, with the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% up 0.1% ahead of the news conference. Equities rose to a string of new records following Trump's Nov. 8 election victory, but the rally has subsequently cooled.\n\nSee:Here's why Trump's inauguration could mark a near-term top for stocks\n\nStock-market investors will be pining for information on a range of topics, particularly given the lack of detail surrounding the incoming administration's ambitious but vague economic plans. Trump is slated to talk to the press at 11 a.m. Eastern in his first full-scale news conference since July.\n\nRead:The biggest risk as markets shrug at the Trump-Russia imbroglio\n\nHere are some of the potentially hottest topics:\n\nCorporate tax reform\n\nTrump made an overhaul of the corporate tax code—and tax cuts for individuals—a centerpiece of his economic agenda during the campaign. Trump's plan included a call for a one-time break that would give U.S. companies an incentive to repatriate cash held overseas.\n\nA reduction in the top corporate tax rate to 20% from 35% could add $5 to $7 a share to S&P 500 earnings in 2017, said Russ Koesterich, co–portfolio manager of BlackRock's Global Allocation Fund, in a blog post. That would go a long way toward closing the gap between Wall Street expectations for earnings and reality, he said, providing a real-life tailwind, in the form of faster earnings growth, to a market increasingly driven by hope over experience.\n\nAt the same time, corporate tax reform won't cure all ills and isn't a win for everyone. Changes to deductions and potential border adjustment measures, which would change tax treatment for both importers and exporters, will create winners and losers.\n\nIt's unclear how much detail Trump can provide Wednesday. Many of the details will need to be worked out between Trump and Republican lawmakers, who have their own ideas on elements of the tax plan.\n\nInfrastructure spending\n\nTrump vowed to ramp up spending on infrastructure, including roads, bridges, airports, the electrical grid and other elements. Trump's pledges to boost infrastructure investment were credited as a driver of the postelection stock-market rally.\n\nFew hard details of Trump's infrastructure plans have been revealed. The Trump campaign called for $1 trillion in infrastructure spending over the next decade. But often overlooked is the fact that the plan outlined by the campaign calls for the spending to be funded by tax credits that would provide incentives for private businesses to invest in infrastructure projects.\n\nMore detail on infrastructure plans could be of significant interest to investors in resources, construction and other companies that would be tapped to carry out infrastructure projects.\n\nTrade\n\nSo far, investors have largely shrugged off Trump's campaign threats to label China a currency manipulator and to impose tariffs on imported goods. Since then, he's barely mentioned the protectionist measures that had been a substantial part of his campaign, noted Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda.\n\nShould he tread a similar line today then markets may once again be buoyed by his focus on growth friendly policies as opposed to populist measures that threaten to destabilize and inhibit global trade and growth, Erlam said, in a note. Should he focus on protectionism it will be very interesting to see how markets respond because they have strongly bought into growth friendly policies.\n\nOverall, the market is unlikely to get knocked off track by the news conference, said Randy Frederick, vice president for trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, in an email. With that in mind, the only thing likely to unsettle the markets would be if Trump were to cancel the news conference. And there's no sign that's in the cards.\n\nThe markets seem very willing to give him the benefit of the doubt under most circumstances. If the press conference is cancelled, I think the markets could get uneasy, Frederick said, in an email.\n\nMark DeCambre contributed to this report.\n\nRead: At the Mar-a-Lago doorstep, beside Don King, a Trump news conference of sorts
1. Changes in social security laws, to repeal the file-and-suspend strategy which was used by married couples, occurred late in 2015. This presents some married couples, just entering retirement years, an opportunity to grandfather under the old rules. But this opportunity is only available for a few more months.\n\n2. Interest rate rises are likely to be modest, but will still affect bond returns. As interest rates rise, the value of bonds fall. The longer the duration of the bond, the more likely its fall in price. Since fixed income investments are a defensive part of a portfolio, designed in part to offer some stability to the overall value of the portfolio, retirees might consider instituting a ladder of CDs, purchased directly from banks (and keeping within FDIC limits). Most CDs over 1 year in maturity can be redeemed early with a 180-day interest penalty; if interest rates rise significantly, retirees can exercise this put, in essence, when it makes sense to incur the penalty to reap the higher interest rates for the remainder of the original CD term. A short-term bond fund may be added to the fixed income part of the portfolio, to provide some liquidity. Never forget the threat of inflation; while inflation has been low over the past decade, in particular, it could come roaring back at any time; a ladder of inflation-protected securities held in a tax-deferred (401(k) or IRA) account, or a bond fund containing TIPS, might be a prudent part of a person's fixed income portfolio, to help guard against inflation risk.\n\n3. Markets will remain volatile, as investors are still wary of adverse economic developments and often overreact to same. It's best to have an investment policy that specifies, in advance, what will occur if the stock, bond, real estate or commodities markets (or any other asset class the investor possesses) goes up or down significantly in value. This disciplined approach to rebalancing an investment portfolio pays off.\n\n4. Growth stocks are much more significantly overvalued at present, relative to value stocks. And large-cap stocks have outperformed small-cap stocks over about the last five years, as well. Given this, a long-term allocation of part of an investment portfolio to U.S. small cap value stocks makes sense. Emerging markets stocks are another area that appears to have lower values, relative to other stocks. While volatile, an allocation to emerging markets stocks for a small part of an investment portfolio could significantly add to returns over the long term (10 years or more), provided rebalancing of the portfolio occurs periodically.\n\n5. Equity indexed annuities continue to be marketed as a stock market alternative, when in fact they are an alternative to fixed income investments. Be cautious with these products; insurance company financial strength is very important when purchasing a fixed, or equity indexed, annuity. Additionally, many of these EIAs possess high sales charges, and high surrender fees.\n\n6. On the regulatory front, the U.S. Department of Labor is close to finalizing regulations that will require all those providing advice to 401(k), certain other ERISA-covered retirement plan accounts, and all forms of IRAs, to do so under the fiduciary standard. But, the implementation date is likely to be at the end of 2016, not before. And the regulations won't apply to other types of accounts (such as individual non-IRA accounts, joint accounts, and trust accounts). Hence, investors need to protect themselves:\n\nWork with a fee-only adviser, to ensure conflicts of interest are minimized. (See #7 below, on how to find one.)\n\nHave your adviser sign the fiduciary oath. (See #8 below for more).\n\nThere are many costly products (see #9 below) to avoid: i. Variable annuities which possess deferred contingent sales charges; ii.Equity indexed annuities marketed as alternatives to stock market investing, or any that possess a deferred contingent sales charge; iii.Non-publicly traded REITs; iv.Hedge funds; v.Proprietary mutual funds (mutual funds manufactured by an affiliate of your brokerage firm); vi.Principal trades (such as when a brokerage firm sells you a bond out of their inventory); vii.IPOs (on average, the performance of stocks in IPOs underperforms the rest of the market over the two years following the IPO (initial public offering)—there will always be some big winners, but the losers (underperformers) dominate in this space; viii.Any cash value life insurance product sold for retirement needs.\n\n7.The best advice I can give is to work with a financial adviser who has chosen to avoid most conflicts of interest, by being fee-only. The best way to find such advisers is through organizations of fee-only advisers:\n\nNational Association of Personal Financial Advisors (www.napfa.org);\n\nGarrett Planning Network (www.garrettplanningnetwork.com);\n\nAlliance of Comprehensive Planners (www.acplanners.org); and\n\nXY Planning Network (www.xyplanningnetwork.com).\n\n8. Without a doubt, all retirees who choose to work with a financial planner should have their planner sign the Fiduciary Oath suggested by The Committee for the Fiduciary Standard, located here. If you have a current adviser, and that adviser won't sign the fiduciary oath within a reasonable time after being asked, that's a strong warning sign that the consumer should seek a second opinion from a fee-only financial planner/investment adviser.\n\n9. About 90% of investment products have fees and costs which are too high. The academic research in this area, stretching back for decades now, is compelling—higher fees are almost certainly going to lead to lower returns over the long run. Consider a racehorse in the Kentucky Derby. All of the horses racing must carry the same weight—jockey, tack, and (when necessary to equalize things out) some small weights in the saddlebag. If a horse carries more weight (similar, for example, to investments with higher fees), the horse still might manage some smart strategy and win a short race, but for longer races the extra weight is definitely going to slow that horse down. By far the largest single factor affecting investor returns in mutual funds, variable annuities, ETFs and other pooled investment vehicles are the fees and costs incurred. Low-cost products will highly likely possess higher returns over the long run, and just a small difference in returns can add up over a long retirement.\n\n10. Other than keeping fees (and there are many hidden fees in investment products) and costs low, the next most important decision relates to strategic asset allocation—i.e., what is the target allocation to various asset classes (U.S. stocks, foreign stocks, fixed income investments, etc.) over the long term. Many retirees have investment portfolios that are either too aggressive or too conservative. And most risk tolerance questionnaires lack true insight into how much investment risk you NEED to take on, as opposed to how much risk you can tolerate. Developing a strategic asset allocation, as part of an overall investment policy, is an area that a fee-only, expert financial planner/investment adviser can help a retiree with.\n\n11. Financial advisers can add value, but only if they are experts and have very high ethical standards. Look for advisers who possess a Certified Financial Planner certification (73,000+ in the U.S. now), as a baseline indication of competency. The CPA/PFS (personal financial specialist), Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) and Chartered Financial Consultant designations are also worthwhile. Most of the other 200 or more designations don't pass muster.\n\n12. I urge retirees to use caution when purchasing fixed annuities, and another newer type of (fixed) annuity—the longevity annuity. If interest rates do, in fact, increase, then better annuitization rates will likely appear, resulting in greater payouts from the annuities. While fixed annuities have a place to play for some retirees, purchasing one should likely be done with the aid of a fee-only adviser who possesses expertise in evaluating the strength of the life insurance company, the vitality of the state insurance guarantee fund which might be available in case of insurance company default, whether to structure the annuity with a CPI (inflation) rider or equivalent, whether to ladder fixed annuities over time, and to secure the better rates through shopping for no-load or low-load annuities.\n\n13. Longevity continues to increase. Don't plan for average life expectancies—consider the possibility that your life expectancy might be longer than average. I tell most of my clients that we are going to plan for them to live to age 100, and that we will manage the portfolio on that basis. I don't want my clients to run out of money at age 90, or 95!\n\n14. Have a fee-only financial planner undertake a comprehensive review of all of your various types of insurance—home, auto, umbrella, life, health (including Medicare Part C or D, Medigap), long-term care, etc. Most retirees tend to have too much for some types of insurance, and too little for other types—or, by not shopping around every couple of years, they are paying far too much relative to other, lower-cost policies.\n\n15. Take a home inventory. Take out that smartphone and photograph EVERYTHING in your house, garage, attic, etc. Open up drawers. Take photos of closet contents. Take close-ups. Then save all of these photos to a flash drive, and put the flash drive in a safe-deposit box (or have a relative who resides somewhere else) hold it. In the event of fire, flood or other natural disaster, having such pictures really helps to secure a greater settlement with the insurance company over personal property items.\n\n16. Plan for 2025. That's about the time we should have self-driving cars. And, as you get older, time proceeds faster (in your perception), which slows your reaction times. These and other factors tend to make driving skills decline over time. With self-driving cars will come far fewer accidents, and car ownership will change. More and more people will have shared cars (just call up a car, using an app), which should cut the cost of car ownership and use dramatically. And, it will aid many older retirees to maintain mobility. So, if you plan to purchase a car anytime soon, plan to keep it for 10 years, and realize that this might be the last car you purchase in your lifetime, as you will rent self-driving cars in the future.\n\n17. Lastly, know what your bucket list is all about, and have a road map for attaining it. To formulate a bucket list, have your financial adviser ask you this question: If your doctor told you that you had only 5-6 years to live, and during that time you'll be as healthy as your are now, what would you want to do or accomplish so that, at the end of your life, you had no regrets?
Democrats' apparent sweep in the Georgia Senate runoffs means they can dust off some of the lofty legislative plans for 2021 they made before the November election, but experts say they should temper their expectations.\n\nAssuming Jon Ossoff's lead over Sen. David Perdue holds up, Democrats will hold sway over the 50-50 split Senate once Vice President-elect Kamala Harris takes office Jan. 20 to cast tie-breaking votes in the chamber.\n\nIn the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi will lead a shrunken Democratic caucus that will have the smallest majority in years.\n\nThose factors mean Democrats will have a narrow path to write legislation that will please a resurgent liberal wing, leave moderates who took the worst losses in the last election mollified, and still be substantive.\n\nWhat's the issue? And then, depending on the issue, the question is whether you're going to lose Democrats, said Jim Manley, a former spokesman for Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.\n\nRelated: Warnock projected winner, while Ossoff clings to slim lead in second Georgia race\n\nIn the short term, the sweep means another round of economic stimulus to offset the effects of the coronavirus is likely to come sooner and be bigger than otherwise. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said they would expect about $600 billion more in stimulus under a Democratic Congress, for example.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer signaled in a statement on Wednesday that he expected more COVID-19 aid would be coming.\n\nIt feels like a brand new day, the New York lawmaker said. For too long, much-needed help has been stalled or diluted by a Republican-led Senate and President Trump. That will change with a Democratic Senate, Democratic House, and a Democratic President.\n\nLong-term, given the filibuster and a united Republican front, other priorities, like immigration, climate change and infrastructure, will face an uphill climb.\n\nStill, winning the Senate has its perks — Schumer would set the legislative agenda, hold committee hearings and exercise oversight of federal agencies.\n\nCertainly there are advantages to holding the Senate majority —Democrats would chair Senate committees, set the agenda, and a Democratic Majority Leader could help confirm Biden administration nominees, wrote Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy strategist for Stifel Nicolaus & Co., in a note.\n\nHowever, the difference between a 50-50 Senate and a 51-49 Senate on the ability to pass legislation is small.\n\nRepublicans would still be able to use the filibuster to block major legislation, meaning 60 votes would be needed to move a bill forward and the narrow margin will continually tempt Democratic senators to demand concessions from leadership in return for their vote.\n\nThat narrow margin could also incentivize bipartisanship, though. Already, a small bipartisan group of senators, working with a similar group in the House called the Problem Solvers Caucus, played a major role in developing the second big coronavirus aid package. It also called for senators to refrain from challenging the Electoral College results when the votes were presented to Congress.\n\nThe bipartisan group showed in the lame duck that just by demonstrating what is viable at the 60-vote threshold, they can exert significant leverage, said Liam Donovan, principal with Bracewell LLP's Policy Resolution Group.\n\nI don't think that's going to be replicable on a regular basis, but if you're Biden you look to that group as your legislative litmus test, and the GOP rump you can conceivably work with even if the Leader needs convincing.\n\nManley was a bit more wary.\n\nThese groups, at least in recent years, don't have a good track record. They keep getting marginalized in the end, he said.\n\nOne major consequence of a Democratic Senate would be the nominees the Biden administration sends to Capitol Hill for confirmation. Faced with the threat of Democratic filibusters, Senate Republicans during the Trump administration turned to filling the federal judicial ranks with judges they hoped would be friendly to conservative causes.\n\nA simple majority allows Biden to move his nominees far more quickly, easily, and with a far broader pool of talent to choose from, Donovan said.\n\nHaving the Senate would also allow Democrats to push through some types of legislation with a simple majority, using an optional process called budget reconciliation. While reconciliation bills are filibuster-proof, they are subject to strict requirements on subject matter and budgetary impact.\n\nRelated: Biden could use GOP trick to open door to 'big things' in 2021\n\nWhile reconciliation could be powerful tool — especially if Democrats use it twice in one year, as Republicans did in 2017 — the narrow margins in both chambers mean leaders will have to thread the needle in writing bills. Repealing some of the 2017 tax cuts would meet the rules and have broad Democratic support, for example, while the Green New Deal would likely have a tougher time on both counts.\n\nIt depends on the issue, but in a very narrowly held Senate, I don't think it's a given, Manley said.\n\nHighlighting the potential ideological difficulties, Donovan said reconciliation would allow Democrats to within the strictures of the process, move anything that Bernie Sanders and Joe Manchin can agree on.
Goldman Sachs & Co. is aiming to become part of the cryptocurrency trading industry after receiving requests from its clients to facilitate clearing.\n\nThat's according to Chief Financial Officer R.

The global case tally for the coronavirus illness COVID-19 rose above 90 million on Monday, and the U.S. topped 22 million confirmed cases, after setting a record for new cases in a single day of more than 300,000 on Friday.\n\nIt was the first time the U.S. has counted more than 300,000 cases in a single day since the start of the outbreak, confirming the worst fears of experts who had urged Americans not to travel during the recent holiday season or to mingle with other households. It comes after a record of more than 4,000 deaths were recorded on Thursday, or more than died in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nAmid the flurry of news about runoff elections and riots hitting your inbox already in the new year, you may have missed the fact that COVID remains out of control in the U.S., as we record more than 241,600 cases per day on average, more than 3,100 fatalities per day on average, and more than 129,000 Americans currently hospitalized with the deadly virus, Raymond James analyst Chris Meekins wrote in a note to clients.\n\nThe U.S. counted at least 208,338 cases on Sunday, according to a New York Times tracker, and at least 1,777 people died. Weekend numbers are generally underreported because staffing at hospitals and health care centers is reduced. In the past week, the U.S. has averaged 254,866 cases a day, the tracker shows. The U.S. continues to lead the world by cases, at 22.4 million, and fatalities, at 374,348, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University.\n\n Amid the flurry of news about runoff elections and riots hitting your inbox already in the new year, you may have missed the fact that COVID remains out of control in the U.S., as we record more than 241,600 cases per day on average, more than 3,100 fatalities per day on average, and more than 129,000 Americans currently hospitalized with the deadly virus.  — Chris Meekins, analyst, Raymond James\n\nDr. Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Friday that last week's storming of the U.S. Capitol by a mob of supporters of President Donald Trump was likely a superspreader event, adding his voice to the many that had raised that concern last week.\n\nI do think you have to anticipate that this is another surge event, Redfield said in an interview with newspaper group McClatchy. You had largely unmasked individuals in a nondistanced fashion, who were all through the Capitol.\n\nSeparately, the Office of Attending Physician said lawmakers, who were forced to shelter in place in small rooms during the riot with some refusing to wear face masks, may have been exposed to the virus, the Washington Post reported, another concern raised by some lawmakers last week.\n\nSee now: U.S. counts record of almost 4,000 COVID-19 deaths in a day as virus continues to wreak havoc\n\nThe CDC's vaccine tracker, meanwhile, shows that as of 9.00 a.m. ET Friday, just 6.7 million Americans had received a vaccine, and just 22 million had been distributed. The vaccine program has lagged all of its original targets since the first emergency authorizations were granted to the vaccines developed by Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.11% and German partner BioNTech SE BNTX, -1.33% , and one developed by Moderna Inc. MRNA, -5.43% , with much fanfare in December.\n\nOperation Warp Speed, the federal government program set up to accelerate development of vaccines and therapies for COVID-19, had initially promised 100 million doses would be delivered by end-December, later revising that number to 40 million and then 20 million.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has left it to states to administer the vaccine program — tweeting that it was up to the states to administer and then calling some states very slow — meaning that stressed state health departments, which have already had to deal with testing, contact tracing, public information campaigns and deciding when or whether schools or businesses should be open or closed, are now tasked with handling the biggest public health effort in decades.\n\nSee:These COVID-19 tax relief measures just got extended\n\nIn other news:\n\n• China has agreed to allow a team of experts from the World Health Organization to enter the country to investigate the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Question: My wife and I are both 70 and about to deal with required minimum distributions. We are in the 25% (or maybe 28% this year) tax bracket and our 401(k) and IRA assets are in the $1.2 million range. All are pretax contributions. We are both fortunate enough to have pensions, in addition to Social Security, which we live off. At this point, we don't need the money from our 401(k) and IRAs to live on. We are about to get clobbered over the next years with higher taxes due to required minimum distributions. Is your view that a good strategy may be to convert part of our 401(k) and IRAs to Roth IRAs and take a tax hit now to avoid future RMD tax consequences? And, if so, how much would you recommend we convert this year and then future years? —B.V.\n\nAnswer: Here's what Ben Norquist, president and CEO of Convergent Retirement Plan Solutions, in St. Cloud, Minn., had to say:\n\nGiven the myriad variables involved, the decision of whether to convert some or all of one's pretax retirement savings to a Roth IRA is seldom simple. While there a several ways one can potentially benefit from a Roth IRA conversion, it is not uncommon to find situations where one factor favors conversion while one or more other factors indicate caution.\n\nFor example, one can potentially benefit from a Roth IRA conversion by delaying required distributions, thereby enabling his or her retirement savings to enjoy extended tax shelter. Another potential way for one to benefit from a Roth conversion is when it is likely that the tax rate paid at the time of conversion will be less than the tax rate that would be paid at some point in the future (either by the IRA holder or his/her beneficiaries).\n\nWhen contemplating a Roth conversion, the challenges of analysis are compounded when one factor is in your favor (in this case, postponing required distributions) while another factor may be neutral or potentially even work against you. For example, if your heir's tax rate ends up being lower than your current tax rate, much of the benefit derived from postponing required distributions via Roth conversion could potentially be offset by the higher tax rate paid at the time of conversion (versus the lower tax rate your heirs would have paid on any savings remaining in a traditional IRA at the time of inheritance).\n\nWhile it would be irresponsible to make a call as to whether a Roth conversion is warranted based on the minimal information available, it would appear you are a good candidate for further, in-depth analysis and that you could potentially benefit from some level of Roth conversion.\n\nOne last point: When seeking out a professional adviser to assist you with exploring your Roth conversion options, you would do well to avoid advisers who demonstrate a strong, knee-jerk opinion (positive or negative) about the strategy. Unfortunately, the topic of Roth conversions seems to attract a disproportionate number of irrational opponents and proponents, with both groups tending to base their viewpoint more on hyperbole than on rational analysis.
As COVID-19 hobbled the economy, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from energy and industry dropped more than 10% last year, reaching a three-decade low.\n\nBut the plunge came at a cost and on its own does little to sway sobering predictions that greater renewable energy use is needed and needed quickly to help the U.S. create a lasting pollution decline.\n\nThe 10.3% 2020 U.S. emissions drop outpaced that seen after the Great Recession of 2009 when emissions dipped 6.3%, says Rhodium Group, which published its findings Tuesday.\n\nWith emissions down 21% below 2005 levels, this means the U.S. is expected to far exceed its 2020 Copenhagen Accord target of a 17% reduction below 2005 levels, said Kate Larsen and other researchers, writing in the report.\n\nHowever, 2020 should not in any way be considered a down payment toward the U.S. meeting its 2025 Paris Agreement target of 26%-28% below 2005 levels, the group, which includes Hannah Pitt and Alfredo Rivera, said. The emission reductions of 2020 have come with an enormous toll of significant economic damage and human suffering. With coronavirus vaccines now in distribution, we expect economic activity to pick up again in 2021, but without meaningful structural changes in the carbon intensity of the U.S. economy, emissions will likely rise again as well.\n\nThe Trump administration pulled the U.S. from the voluntary Paris pledge alleging spotty compliance from other big emitters. President-elect Joe Biden has promised reinstatement. The U.N.-linked Paris pact aims to hold the increase in average global temperatures well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally no more than 1.5C (2.7 F), compared to pre-industrial levels.\n\nRead: Blame it on the rain: Climate change has caused billions of dollars in flood damages\n\nSeveral of the hardest hit economic sectors — including transportation, electric power and industry — are typically the leading sources of U.S. GHG emissions. With the possible exception of the power sector, where coal's decline has been driving a steady reduction in power sector emissions over the past decade, emission reductions in 2020 resulted largely from reductions in overall economic activity.\n\nTravel demand faced the steepest drop-off this year, leading to a 14.7% decline in transportation sector emissions between 2019 and 2020, Rhodium said. Americans drove 15% fewer miles in 2020 compared to 2019 and the demand for jet fuel fell by more than one-third.\n\nPower sector emissions dropped 10.3, paced by a nearly 19% reduction in emissions from coal generation, year-on-year. That's the largest such decline in recorded history, breaking last year's record fall. Over the past decade, utilities have retired hundreds of coal-burning power plants despite President Trump's efforts to revive the industry.\n\nIndustrial emissions were down 7.0% and emissions from buildings were down 6.2%, year-on-year, the report showed.\n\nThe vast majority of 2020's emission reductions were due to decreased economic activity and not from any structural changes that would deliver lasting reductions in the carbon intensity of our economy, the Rhodium researchers said. If COVID-19 and the resulting recession hadn't happened, we estimate that U.S. emissions would have declined by only around 3% this year, driven in large part by the decline of coal-fired power generation and to a lesser extent the reduction in heating demand due to warmer winter weather.\n\nRead: 2020 brought 22 climate-change disasters costing $1 billion or more and capped the hottest decade on record\n\nThe team said with growth expected to bounce back in 2021 (most forecasts currently project GDP growth of 3% to 4%), emissions will likely increase as well absent a concerted effort.\n\nLast year's spate of intensifying natural disasters, including western U.S. wildfires, did have its own impact in an otherwise less-polluted year.\n\nEven as pollution emissions declined from other sources including vehicle exhaust and power plants, the amount from fires increased sharply, said researchers at Stanford University and the University of California, San Diego. The findings underscore the growing public health threat that doctors say climate change brings.\n\nNationwide, wildfires were the source of up to 25% of small particle pollution in some years, the researchers said.\n\nAn Associated Press analysis of data from government monitoring stations found that at least 38 million people in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana were exposed to unhealthy levels of wildfire smoke for at least five days in 2020. Major cities in Oregon suffered the highest pollution levels they had ever recorded.\n\nThe year featured another development that could help reduce pollution in a more lasting way. Renewable energy surged in 2020, in large part because the industry built a record number of new wind turbines and solar panels to take advantage of a federal tax credit. The nation produced roughly as much electricity from renewable sources last year as it did from coal, a milestone not seen before.
JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU, -2.27% said late Thursday that it plans to give a $1,000 bonus to its 21,000 employees except the chief executive, and its executive vice presidents. JetBlue stock is flat at $21.69 after hours. The company cited the federal tax reform legislation and the company said it will dole out the cash by the end of February. In the months ahead, we look forward to working with our Values Committees and directly with you on other ideas for how we can use tax reform benefits to make JetBlue even stronger, the company said. JetBlue joins other companies such as Netflix Inc. NFLX, -3.75% , several banks such as Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +2.43% , and others such as Comcast Corp. CMCSA, -2.83% , which have announced similar plans. Rival Southwest Airlines Co. LUV, -1.34% has also announced a $1,000 bonus.

Supervalu Inc. svu reported Wednesday fiscal third-quarter net income of $26 million, or 67 cents a share, compared with a loss of $26 million, or 69 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, such as merger and store closure charges and costs, adjusted earnings per share were 61 cents, beating the FactSet consensus of 46 cents. Adjusted EPS included a 30 cent discrete tax benefit. Revenue rose 31% to $3.94 billion, but fell shy of the FactSet consensus of $4.00 billion. Wholesale sales rose 52% to $2.89 billion, but was just below the FactSet consensus of $2.91 billion, while retail sales fell 4.1% to $1.02 billion, which was just below expectations of $1.04 billion. Same-store sales fell 3.5%, compared with the FactSet consensus for a 3.7% decline. The grocery store chain said it expects 2018 net earnings from continuing operations to a loss of $20 million to earnings of $2 million, which includes a charge of $35 million to $45 million to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets as a result of new tax legislation. The company had previously expected net earnings from continuing operations of $31 million to $50 million. The stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has lost 4.3% over the past three months, while the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% has gained 7.9%.
Several of the most popular Trump trades have either stalled or reversed in recent weeks — a sign that the market's postelection exuberance is beginning to wane.\n\nOn Thursday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.711% touched its lowest level since Nov. 30, putting it on track to notch a fourth straight week of declines. For those who are unfamiliar with bond-market dynamics, keep in mind that yields move inversely to prices.\n\nGold, which tanked after the election as the inflation trade reasserted itself, hit its highest levels since late November on Thursday. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar has drifted lower over the past two weeks, with the ICE U.S. Dollar index DXY, +0.43% , a widely watched gauge of the buck's value versus its biggest rivals, is trading at its weakest level in a month.\n\nRead: Is it finally time for the inflation trade?\n\nFurthermore, the torrid equity rally that followed the election has effectively stalled. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% , which only recently came within a hair's breadth of 20,000, has retreated.\n\nAll of these trades are, fundamentally, driven by the same factor: The expectation that Trump's policies will spur growth and stoke inflationary pressures if his administration slashes corporate taxes, embarks on a massive spending program and rolls back regulation as speculated.\n\nBut investors have only a vague idea of the details of each proposed policy, and the approximate timing is difficult to gauge. And this is increasingly becoming a problem for investors.\n\nStocks\n\nFinancial stocks rose 20% between election day and Dec. 20, accounting for the bulk of the run-up in the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% . But they've retreated in the new year.\n\nIn contrast, health-care shares shook off their sluggish postelection performance in the new year. but that trend came to an abrupt end on Wednesday when Trump accused pharmaceutical companies of getting away with murder by manufacturing drugs abroad. Though they remain on track for their best weekly performance since the election.\n\nBut Trump isn't the only factor impacting stocks: investors are also exiting positions ahead of the fourth-quarter earnings season, which is about to begin in earnest.\n\nWhile economic data suggest that global economic growth is improving, the outlook for earnings remains unclear, said John Canally, an investment strategist and economist at LPL Financial.\n\nIt isn't just Trump, Canally said. There are other things going on here.\n\nBonds\n\nTreasury prices had been drifting lower since the summer, but the trend accelerated after the election as investors bet that the fiscal stimulus promised by Trump would alleviate some of the pressure on the Federal Reserve, allowing them to raise interest rates more swiftly.\n\nFed policy makers raised their median forecast for the number of rate increases in 2017 to three in December, up from two previously. But minutes from the central bank's December meeting revealed that many officials are still cautious.\n\nOn Thursday, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he believes growth and interest rates will remain low in 2017, in part because any Trump-sponsored stimulus efforts likely won't arrive until 2018 or 2019.\n\nThis bond-market reversal is setting investors up for an interesting showdown, said George Goncalves, head of fixed-income strategy at Nomur, between real money—a Wall Street term for mutual fund and pension fund investors—versus the fast money tied to hedge funds.\n\nSpeculative money is as short as it has been in a long time, but real money is putting cash to work, Goncalves said.\n\nGold\n\nGold has rallied sharply over the past three weeks in what MarketWatch's Mark DeCambre called one of the clearest signs that a rally inspired by President-elect Donald Trump is starting to stall.\n\nGold futures were trading at a six-week high near $1,200 an ounce on Thursday. Gold plunged in the aftermath of the election. Along with bonds, the shiny metal fell victim to the inflation trade—the notion that Trump's fiscal policies would cause inflation to accelerate in 2017.\n\nBecause it doesn't carry a yield, gold is considered a hedge against inflation, and typically outperforms when interest rates are low and prices of consumer goods are stagnant.\n\nThe dollar\n\nIncreasing interest-rate expectations, as well as Trump's promise to allow U.S. corporations to repatriate foreign earnings free of tax, have helped boost the dollar.\n\nTypically, rising interest rates, or the expectation thereof, cause a currency to appreciate by increasing the return on assets denominated in that currency, making it more attractive to foreign investors.\n\nRead:The dollar rally has about run its course, by these measures\n\nBut currency traders were disheartened when Trump provided scant details about his economic policy priorities at a press conference on Wednesday—and the dollar sold off accordingly.\n\nNow, does this mean the Trump trade in whole is dead? Not necessarily. But for now, at least, these trades are likely to stall until the inauguration, at the very least, market strategists said.\n\nPeople bought the hope. Not just the rumor, but the hope, said Greg Anderson, global head of currency strategy at BMO Capital Markets. I think they'll be right on the fact, but in the mean time, you're holding a position that is very vulnerable to periodic cleanouts.
Shares of Citigroup Inc. C, +0.33% shed 0.5% in morning trade Wednesday, after UBS did an about-face on the banking giant, flipping to bearish from bullish, amid concerns over how new protectionist policies may affect Citigroup's global franchise. Analyst Saul Martinez gave the stock a rare sell rating, after it was at buy for nearly three years. He cut the stock price target to $58, which is 3.2% below current levels, from $64. Only 15% of companies covered by Citigroup have sell ratings. Citigroup's global franchise is generally a good thing, but it also leaves the company less levered to lower corporate tax rates and higher interest rates in the U.S., and more exposed to risks associated with the President-elect's protectionist policy stances, Martinez wrote in a note to clients. He said an underperforming Mexican franchise and Asia consumer businesses in slower growth markets also dampen his view. The stock has soared 20% since the election, while the SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF XLF, +0.52% has climbed 18% and the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% has gained 6%.
Macy's Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. Inc. reported same-store sales increases during the holiday shopping period, while Victoria's L Brands Inc., fresh off of an analyst upgrade, issued a profit warning.\n\nStill, shares are down for all three retailers, along with many others across the sector. Macy's and J.C. Penney shares were each down more than 5% in early Thursday trading, while L Brands took the largest tumble of 15%.\n\nMacy's M, -4.97% stock is down 3.7% in Thursday trading and J.C. Penney US:JCP is down 1.9%. L Brands LB, -1.57% has taken the largest tumble, nearly 12%.\n\nMacy's said same-store sales during the months of November and December 2017 rose 1% on an owned basis and were up 1.1% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. The company saw double-digit growth online and improved holiday sales across Macy's, Macy's Backstage, Bloomingdale's and its outlet, and the beauty brand Blue Mercury.\n\nMacy's Chief Executive Jeff Gennette says the same-store sales result sets the retailer up for a positive fourth quarter. The fourth-quarter FactSet consensus is for same-store sales decline of 1.7%.\n\nSee: Ulta Beauty and Adidas rank among Wells Fargo's top retail-stock picks for 2018\n\nHere's how robots can revolutionize e-commerce\n\nIncluded in announced cost management efforts will be staffing adjustments, with some stores seeing reductions as others hire, and 11 store closures in early 2018. Four of those closures were previously announced. Stores will close in Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities nationwide. That brings the number of shuttered stores since 2015 to 124.\n\nMacy's expects annual expense savings to total $300 million beginning fiscal 2018, and one-time charges of $160 million, or about 33 cents per share, which will be booked in the fourth quarter.\n\nMacy's also updated its guidance, and now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share of $3.59 to $3.69 including tax reform measures, versus previous guidance of $3.38 to $3.63. The company expects same-store sales on an owned basis to decline between 2.4% and 2.7%, and a decline between 2% and 2.3% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. Sales are expected to be down between 3.6% and 3.9%.\n\nThe FactSet consensus is for full-year EPS of $3.44 and a same-store sales decline of 3.4%. Macy's expects a non-cash tax benefit in fiscal 2017 of $550 million to $650 million from the federal tax rate reduction.\n\nAlso:Can men save retail? Nordstrom makes big bet on a once overlooked shopper\n\nThe holiday sales growth at Macy's is a welcome change from the red numbers it usually posts, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. Moreover, it sends a positive signal that other retailers are on course for a solid holiday season.\n\nStill, there are issues to be mindful of, including relatively weak growth that was far less than the overall sector, he said. Saunders also expressed concerns that the improved performance comes as a result of the consumer's willingness to spend rather than any particular measures Macy's has taken.\n\n[W]e maintain that the focus should be on growing the top line through improvements to stores, ranges and the general proposition, Saunders said. In our view, Macy's still has an enormous amount to work to do here.\n\nJ.C. Penney Co. Inc. reported a 3.4% same-store sales increase for the nine weeks ending Dec. 30, 2017, and reaffirmed its full-year guidance. The fourth-quarter FactSet consensus is for same-store sales growth of 0.8%.\n\nThe retailer saw improved same-store performance across apparel, particularly in women's and kids, and double-digit sales growth in e-commerce, according to a statement from Chief Executive Marvin Ellison. And the company is now able to fill e-commerce orders from all of its brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nJ.C. Penney reaffirmed its previous guidance for full-year fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 2 cents to 8 cents and flat to a 1% same-store sales decline. The FactSet consensus is for EPS of 7 cents and a same-store sales decline of 0.5%.\n\nRead:Neiman Marcus CEO reportedly to step aside for outsider replacement\n\nL Brands Inc. reported of $2.52 billion for the five weeks ending Dec. 30, up from $2.44 billion last year. Same-store sales were up 1% for the period.\n\nThe company expects to report fourth-quarter earnings per share of about $2 before the impact of one-time items or tax reform measures, compared with guidance of $1.95 to $2.10. The FactSet consensus is $2.03.\n\nAt Victoria's Secret, growth in the beauty and Pink businesses was more than offset by a decline in lingerie, said Chief Investor Relations Officer Amie Preston on the pre-recorded earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript.\n\nVictoria's Secret has struggled with its exit from the swim and apparel categories. However, L Brands was upgraded at Baird Equity Research on Wednesday on 2018 earnings-per-share growth potential.\n\n[W]e monitor for consistent improvements in a more balanced lingerie assortment, which can help support price improvements, wrote Cowen & Company analysts led by Oliver Chen. Further, we watch for prospects for improved store traffic (store comps -6% at Victoria's Secret during December) that is not driven by promotional activity, which could include targeted direct mail.

Shares of Commercial Metals Co. CMC, -1.36% were indicated down 2% in premarket trade Monday, after the metals products company reported a fiscal first-quarter adjusted profit that rose in line with expectations, while sales came up a bit shy. Net earnings for the quarter to Nov. 30 fell to $19.7 million, or 17 cents a share, from $36.8 million, or 31 cents a share in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, such as $22.1 million in tax expenses, adjusted earnings per share rose to 35 cents from 31 cents, matching the FactSet consensus of 35 cents. Sales rose to $1.28 billion from $1.08 billion, but was just below the FactSet consensus of $1.29 billion, as an increase in Americas fabrication sales offset declined in recycling and mills sales. Results for the first quarter were strong even though we experienced historically wet weather in the U.S. which reduced shipments, said Chief Executive Barbara Smith. The stock has shed 15.1% over the past three months through Friday, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% has lost 12.3%.
The big prize is Wednesday's Powerball drawing is already up to $500 million. And while you know you won't get to keep everything, where will the tax hit be biggest?\n\nFirst off, every winner is subject to a 25% federal withholding tax. So that $500 million, reduced to $306 million for those who prefer the lump-sum payment, really will be no more than $229.5 million. Still enough to buy an apartment on Manhattan's Billionaires Row.
Dear Moneyist,\n\nI am a 25-year-old with a great job, but a long family history (and short personal history) of poor money management. I've done my best to overcome this and despite having some debt (less than $5,000), I have been making great progress in both shoring up my financial future and paying down what I currently owe. I've even managed to complete most of a bachelor's degree without taking on student loans.\n\n I appreciate the thought, but it does make me uncomfortable to accept financial gifts, partially because I know that some of these family members are not in great shape themselves and could probably use the money more responsibly. \n\nAfter thinking about it for a long time and reviewing my finances and what costs I could expect, I made the significant decision to purchase a house. I scrimped and saved every penny, withdrew from my Registered Retirement Savings Plan, and temporarily withdrew from school to get the money together for a down payment.\n\nAside from some cosmetic work that the house needs, it's in a great neighborhood and in good shape, and actually costs about what I was paying when I was renting. My family is very proud of me for managing this at my young age and, as the holidays are approaching, some members are talking about giving me financial gifts.\n\nI appreciate the thought, but it does make me uncomfortable to accept financial gifts, partially because I know that some of these family members are not in great shape themselves and could probably use the money more responsibly, and partially because the decision and commitment to a property and mortgage were ones that I made alone, and I don't feel they should have to contribute in any way.\n\nAm I being foolish about this, or am I right to encourage them to invest in themselves? If so, is there a better way to present it than admonishing them for past financial choices?\n\nIn an Awkward Situation\n\nDear Awkward,\n\nYou give millennials a good name. Bravo!\n\nWhat a treat to receive a letter that's not about someone borrowing money from his family and not wanting to repay it or trying to find out how to ask a friend or family member for money owed to them, but from someone who actually doesn't want to receive money from his family. I recently received a letter from a woman took money (as a loan) from her father and didn't want to repay it. Her father had died and, as she thought, so did the obligation to repay the money to her father's estate.\n\n Sometimes, gifts can come with a gift tax, which could be due at any time. That is, the giver feels like he/she has a hold over the person who received the gift. And this tax could be due just when you least expect it.  — The Moneyist\n\nSometimes, gifts can come with a gift tax, which could be due at any time. That is, the giver feels like he/she has a hold over the person who received the gift. And this tax could be due just when you least expect it. (Even gifts as small as concert tickets can result in the giver calling in favors or even taking advantage of the beneficiary of the gift.) If you accept money from your family, especially with no expectation that it be returned, you are indeed obliged to them for the rest of your life.\n\nAlso read:Can I collect the $175,000 my husband loaned his friend?\n\nThe Moneyist: What to do about your finances during a divorce\n\nAre you being foolish? On the contrary, you are being smart. If your family members want to help you financially, why not ask them for items that you need: Patio furniture, an ironing board or rug; these items will also make the family feel less like they have a stake in your house. Giving money to family members can also create jealousy among those who like to keep score. Some children, like Sarah in Washington, D.C., believe that they are automatically entitled to their parents' money, for instance. Nice as it is to get a helping hand, we are not entitled to our family's money.\n\nDon't forget to finish your schooling and replenish your retirement plan. Otherwise, start as you mean to go on. Your parents may give you money as a gift and, given that it's the holiday season, you may feel OK accepting. They're your parents, after all. I advise caution when it comes to other members of your family. Your independence is priceless.\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

It's meaningless to have the right investment thesis if your timing is bad. No one learned this lesson more in 2020 than all the sad sacks who shorted Tesla TSLA, +3.68% .\n\nGiven such metrics as the current price-to-earnings ratio of 1,400, to name but one, the thesis that the electric vehicle maker is wildly overvalued is even more valid today than a year ago. But the timing of betting against it? Who knows. You know what Mr. Market says: The market can stay irrational longer than most investors can stay solvent. Mr. Market, if you haven't been introduced, was the character created by Warren Buffett's mentor—Benjamin Graham—in his 1949 classic The Intelligent Investor. In it, he warned of the dangers of market irrationality and group think.\n\nGroup think\n\nTesla's rise is fueling the group think that electric vehicles are disrupting the U.S. and global auto markets in a major way.\n\nThis depends on how you define major, and what parts of the global market you're talking about.\n\nFor example, InsideEVs reports, November 2020 was an amazing month for passenger plug-in electric cars with a new all-time monthly record of over 414,300 units! But, it goes on to say, 364,000 of these units—88%—are attributable to China (over 198,000) and Europe (over 166,000). This implies about 50,000 units over the rest of the world, including the world's number two market, the United States.\n\nLet's be charitable for a moment and say that all 50,000 of those other November units were sold in the United States. They weren't, but let's just say they were. Some 17 million vehicles are typically sold in the U.S. each year, according to automotive research and forecast firm Edmunds. That's about 1.41 million per month. Fifty-thousand would be about 3.5% of the market. But again, the true figure is less than that.\n\nSo it's fair to say that despite all the hoopla, and countless media mentions of Tesla's charismatic CEO Elon Musk, the EV share of the U.S. market remains modest.\n\nAll told, with China and Europe driving the EV market, BEVs (battery electric vehicles) and PHEV (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) comprised 3.8% of the global market through the end of November, Inside EVs says. This represents a market share gain of 1 percentage point, given a McKinsey study which said EVs were 2.8% of the global market at the end of March 2020. While still quite small, it's worth noting that the global share was just 0.6% as recently as 2015.\n\nWhy does the U.S. lag China and Europe? The gradual phasing out of generous federal tax credits—up to $7,500 in some cases—hasn't helped. Another has been cheap gasoline prices. The nationwide average price of a gallon of regular was $2.25 on New Year's Day, says AAA, meaning that driving a gas-powered car is quite affordable—not that people are driving to work.\n\nWhile some people may buy an EV for altruistic reasons—the sense that they are striking a blow for the environment—I suspect that good old-fashioned financial incentives are equally attractive—not to mention more tangible—to others.\n\nEurope more generous\n\nThis helps explain why electric vehicles, for all their hype, only account for about 2% of new car sales here in the United States. In Europe, tax breaks tend to be more generous, and the EV share of the market is about 5%. Depending on the car and the country, tax breaks on an electric car can be as much as $10,000—more than enough to sway buyer decisions, all else being equal.\n\nIn Norway, for example, EVs now have a stunning 54% of the market. Why 54%? Because just as cheap gas crimps EV sales in America, they spur EV sales in Norway, where gasoline costs the equivalent of about $7.30 a gallon.\n\nTax breaks are market distortions, meant to support a promising industry in its early stages. Until the principal component of an electric car—its battery—can be made more efficient, they'll probably be needed for a few more years.\n\nThere are two bottlenecks that limit their practicality, says Venkat Viswanathan, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, who is leading a team of battery researchers. We cannot recharge them well enough today, and the other one is that we cannot get all of the capacity, we cannot get a large amount of the energy out.\n\nSadly, there's no battery equivalent of Moore's Law, the 1965 observation of Intel INTC, +1.54% co-founder Gordon Moore that processing power in an integrated circuit doubles every two years. Making batteries more efficient, powerful and longer-lasting is the holy grail of the electric vehicle industry, yet for all the progress that has been made, Viswanathan talks of major breakthroughs in maybe five to 10 years.\n\nPower-grid bottleneck\n\nOther problems may take even longer to untangle. The biggest is the nation's power grid. The Energy Department estimates that U.S. consumption of electricity could rise 38% by 2050, in large part because of electric vehicles.\n\nBut consider that utility providers are often stretched now during peak usage hours, summer heat waves and more. We're all familiar with the mess in California—home to one-in-eight Americans—which already experiences rolling blackouts caused by everything from surging demand, transmission problems, and, an overreliance on renewable energy and natural gas plant challenges during hot weather. What happens when EV sales grow, as Tesla's 1,400 p/e seems to imply?\n\nElectric cars do indeed seem to be the future. Yet it's possible that the prospect of tens of millions of vehicles stretching demand even further—and the possible implications—is being discounted or ignored by some investors. Barriers to growth could slow the adoption rate of EVs more than they may realize.\n\nPaul Brandus is a columnist for MarketWatch and the White House bureau chief for West Wing Reports.

For years I've lectured about the wonderfulness of Roth IRAs. The new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) makes Roth IRAs even more attractive and they can provide insurance against future tax rate increases that I think are almost inevitable. Here's what you need to know about Roth IRAs and especially Roth IRA conversions in the post-TCJA world.\n\nThe two most-important Roth IRA tax advantages are:\n\nUnlike traditional IRA withdrawals, qualified Roth IRA withdrawals are federal-income-tax-free and usually state-income-tax-free too. What is a qualified withdrawal? It's one that is taken after you, as the Roth account owner, have met both of the following requirements:\n\n1. You've had at least one Roth IRA open for over five years.\n\n2. You've reached age 59½ or become disabled or dead.\n\nFor purposes of meeting the five-year requirement, the clock starts ticking on the first day of the tax year for which you make your initial contribution to your first Roth account. That initial contribution can be a regular annual contribution, or it can be a conversion contribution. For example, say your initial Roth pay-in was an annual contribution made on April 1, 2017 for your 2016 tax year. The five-year clock started ticking on Jan. 1, 2016 (the beginning of the tax year for which the contribution was made), and you will meet the five-year requirement on Jan. 1, 2021.\n\nExempt from required minimum distribution rules\n\nUnlike with a traditional IRA, you don't have to start taking annual required minimum distributions (RMDs) from Roth accounts after reaching age 70½. Instead, you can leave your Roth account(s) untouched for as long as you live if you wish. This important privilege makes your Roth IRA a great asset to leave to your heirs (to the extent you don't need the Roth money to help finance your own retirement).\n\nMaking annual Roth IRA contributions\n\nAnnual Roth contributions make the most sense for those who believe they will pay the same or higher tax rates during retirement. Higher future taxes can be avoided on Roth account earnings, because qualified Roth withdrawals are federal-income-tax-free (and usually state-income-tax-free too).\n\nThe downside is you get no deductions for making Roth contributions.\n\nSo if you expect to pay lower tax rates during retirement (good luck with that), you might be better off making deductible traditional IRA contributions (assuming your income permits), because the current deductions may be worth more to you than tax-free withdrawals later on.\n\nThe other best-case scenario for annual Roth contributions is when you have maxed out on deductible retirement plan contributions. For example, you've contributed the maximum possible amount to your 401(k) plan at work. In that case, making Roth contributions is basically a no-brainer.\n\nAnnual contributions are limited and earned income is required\n\nThe absolute maximum amount you can contribute to a Roth account for any tax year is the lesser of: (1) your earned income for the year or (2) the annual contribution limit for the year. Basically, earned income means wage and salary income (including bonuses), self-employment income, and alimony received that is included in your gross income (believe it or not). If you are married, you can add your spouse's earned income to the total. For 2019, the limits are increased to $6,000 and $7,000, respectively.\n\n4 things rich people do with their money that you should be doing\n\nAnnual contribution privilege is phased out at higher incomes\n\nFor 2018, eligibility to make annual Roth contributions is phased out between modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of $120,000 and $135,000 for unmarried individuals. For 2019, the phase-out range is $122,000 to $137,000.\n\nFor married joint filers, the 2018 phase-out range is between MAGI of $189,000 and $199,000. For 2019, the phase-out range is $193,000 to $203,000.\n\nAnnual contribution deadline\n\nThe deadline for making annual Roth contributions is the same as the deadline for annual traditional IRA contributions, i.e., the original due date of your return. For example, the contribution deadline for the 2019 tax year is April 15, 2020. However, you can make a 2019 contribution anytime between now and then. The sooner you contribute, the sooner you can start earning tax-free income.\n\nWell-seasoned individuals can still make annual Roth contributions\n\nAfter reaching age 70½, you can still make annual Roth IRA contributions — assuming there are no problems with the earned income limitation or the income-based phase-out rule. In contrast, you cannot make any more contributions to traditional IRAs after you reach age 70½.\n\nRoth conversions\n\nThe quickest way to get a significant sum into a Roth IRA is by converting a traditional IRA to Roth status. The conversion is treated as a taxable distribution from your traditional IRA, because you're deemed to receive a payout from the traditional account with the money then going into the new Roth account. So doing a conversion before year-end will trigger a bigger federal income tax bill for this year (and maybe a bigger state income tax bill too).\n\nHowever, today's federal income tax rates might be the lowest you'll see for the rest of your life. Thanks to the TCJA, the rates shown below apply for 2019. For 2020, the rate brackets will increase slightly to account for inflation. After 2020, who knows? While the TCJA rate cuts are schedule to last through 2025, they could end sooner, depending on political developments. Even if they last through 2025, I am not optimistic about tax rates in later years.\n\n2019 individual Federal income tax rate brackets\n\nSingle Joint Head of household 10% tax bracket $0 to $9,700 $0 to $19,400 $0 to $13,850 Beginning of 12% $9,701 $19,401 $13,851 Beginning of 22% bracket $39,476 $78,951 $52,851 Beginning of 24% bracket $84,201 $168,401 $84,201 Beginning of 32% bracket $160,726 $321,451 $160,726 Beginning of 35% bracket $204,101 $408,201 $204,101 Beginning of 37% bracket $510,301 $612,351 $510,301\n\nSo if you convert in 2019, you'll pay today's low tax rates on the extra income triggered by the conversion and completely avoid the potential for higher future rates on all the post-conversion income that will be earned in your Roth account. That's because Roth withdrawals taken after age 59½ are totally federal-income-tax-free, as long as you've had at least one Roth account open for over five years. So in effect, the Roth conversion strategy insures you against future tax rate increases that would otherwise hit withdrawals coming from your current traditional IRA balance plus future account earnings.\n\nTo be clear, the best candidates for the Roth conversion strategy are people who believe that their tax rates during retirement will be the same or higher than their current tax rates. If you fit into that category, please keep reading.\n\n5 simple steps to reach $1 million\n\nConsider multi-year conversion strategy\n\nConverting a traditional IRA with a relatively big balance could push you into a higher tax bracket. For example, if you're single and expect your 2019 taxable income to be about $110,000, your marginal federal income tax rate is 24%. Converting a $100,000 traditional IRA into a Roth account in 2019 would cause about half of the extra income from the conversion to be taxed at 32%. But if you spread the $100,000 conversion 50/50 over 2019 and 2020 (which you are allowed to do), all the extra income from converting would be probably taxed at 24%.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nLow current tax cost for converting + insurance against higher tax rates in future years on income that will accumulate in your Roth account = continuing perfect storm for the Roth conversion strategy. However, talk to your tax adviser before pulling the trigger on a conversion — just to make sure you've considered all the relevant factors.
Overstock OSTK, -2.29% will become the first company in the U.S. to pay its taxes in bitcoin.\n\nThe online retailer will take advantage of a program in Ohio, announced in November, to pay a portion of its taxes using the cryptocurrency. Overstock was an early adopter of bitcoin BTCUSD, -1.15% becoming one of the first major retailers to accept bitcoin for payment on its site in 2014.\n\nOverstock chief executive officer and founder Patrick M. Byrne said in a statement that thoughtful government adoption of emerging technologies when accompanied by non-restrictive legislation over these technologies is the best way forward for the U.S., and other advanced economies.\n\nThe plan may sound like a gimmick, but it could actually be a money-saver for businesses in the crypto space, said Neeraj Agrawal, director of communications at Washington, D.C.-based cryptocurrency policy think tank Coin Center.\n\nThis would be good idea for a business that already has a lot of bitcoin as it saves them the step of converting their bitcoin to dollars before paying taxes, he said. Now they will just be converted right at the moment of payment.\n\nThe same goes for people looking to pay their personal income taxes with cryptocurrency, which is not currently allowed in Ohio but will be eventually in the second phase of the program, Ohio state treasurer Josh Mandel told Bitcoin magazine.\n\nIn Phase II, we hope to expand Ohiocrypto.com to include individual personal taxes, and also to expand beyond just bitcoin and include other cryptocurrencies as well, he said. We thought the most intuitive and responsible way to begin this initiative, because it's the first time it's ever been done in America, is to start it off right — and that is by only allowing businesses to pay with bitcoin, and expand it out from there.\n\n As with all cryptocurrency payments, the transaction will trigger capital gains taxes on the bitcoin used to pay taxes, so you'll have to pay taxes on your taxes. \n\nAs with all cryptocurrency payments, the transaction will trigger capital gains taxes on the bitcoin used to pay taxes. In other words, you'll have to pay taxes on your taxes.\n\nWhile this may sound like a headache, it can actually help people who have lost money in bitcoin's volatile year, said Farrukh Shaikh, chief financial officer and cofounder of Gath3r, a cryptocurrency mining service.\n\nIf the current bitcoin price is higher than the price you originally paid, then you would have to pay extra tax on the now realized gain from the bitcoin payment. However, if the current bitcoin price is lower than your basis price, then it amounts to realizing a loss on the bitcoin, which can be offset against your total tax bill and reduce it.\n\nUsing bitcoin to pay taxes may be attractive to people who are currently at a loss from their bitcoin entry price if they want to reduce their bitcoin holdings and pay taxes around the same time, he said.\n\n People must report whether each transaction was a loss or a gain, which can be difficult given the volatility of cryptocurrencies. \n\nBitcoin fell from highs of nearly $20,000 per coin in December 2017 to 10 consecutive sessions below $4,000 in late 2018.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service hasn't released a detailed policy on how to go about paying taxes using cryptocurrency, besides a ruling in 2014 stating that selling bitcoin is treated the same as selling property or any other capital asset. People must report each transaction in terms of whether it was a loss or a gain, which can be difficult given the volatility of cryptocurrencies.\n\nExperts suggest filing taxes with a Certified Public Accountant, particularly one with cryptocurrency expertise, if you have done business in bitcoin in the past year. Thus far, Ohio is the first and only state to accept bitcoin payments from businesses for taxes.\n\nMandel said the state wanted to show it is on the forefront of new technology by announcing the new tax policy by announcing Ohiocrypto.com.\n\nWe wanted to project to the rest of the country that Ohio is embracing technology and is a place that is welcoming software developers and entrepreneurs who want to build a blockchain business here in the state of Ohio, he said.

So far, so very good.\n\nLast year was a historic one for equity markets—with global stocks not recording a single down month and U.S. indexes hitting a record number of records—and while the new year is young, so far it seems to be extending 2017's upward trend.\n\nTuesday marks the 10th trading day of 2018, and market returns over that period stand to be the best in 15 years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% is up 4.3% over that 10-session period, while the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% is up 3.9% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% has gained 4.6%.\n\nAccording to the WSJ Market Data Group, that represents the best 10-day start to a year for both the Dow and the S&P since 2003, when the Dow kicked off the year by rising 4.57% and the S&P rose 4.36%. For the Nasdaq, 2018 marks the best 10-day start since 2012, when it rose 4.72%.\n\nA turn lower on Tuesday weakened the trio's performance on the year. At its peak of the day, both the Dow and the S&P were on track for their best 10-day start since 1987.\n\nThe gains have almost literally been nonstop. Of the 10 trading days in 2018 thus far, both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have risen in eight of them, while the Dow has gained in seven of the 10 days. All three have hit repeated records and powered through multiple milestones; the Dow topped 26,000 for the first time ever on Tuesday, though it subsequently retreated from that level and ended in negative territory for the day.\n\nRelated:Stock performance in Trump's first year was second only to FDR\n\nDespite many market analysts warning about valuations and what they see as excessive optimism, U.S. stocks have been almost completely bereft of volatility or pullbacks. The S&P is poised to go an unprecedented length of time without declining 5% from a peak, something that is typically quite common.\n\nSee:Bets on falling volatility now 'most crowded trade': fund managers\n\nEnergy and consumer discretionary stocks have been the biggest outperformers of the year so far, with both sectors up nearly 6%. Broadly, markets have been supported by improving economic data and an accommodative monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. The recently passed tax bill, which will cut corporate-tax rates, has also been cited as a tailwind driving markets. Separately, corporate earnings have been strong both in the U.S. and internationally.\n\nPast years when stocks have gotten off to such a strong start have typically coincided with steep gains for the market overall. However, kicking January off with a rally hardly guarantees a smooth ride upward, and there may be no more dramatic illustration of this than 1987. While that year started with big gains, it was also the year of Black Monday, the Oct. 19 crash where 23% of market value was wiped out in a single session. However, the S&P still ended up 2% on the year in 1987.\n\nRead more:Why ETFs won't cause, or worsen, a 1987-style crash
The head of the world's largest hedge fund agrees with Democratic-Socialist Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the need to address yawning income equality in the U.S., but he warned that her strategy of taxing the super-wealthy could have unintended consequences on the economy.\n\n'We're in agreement on the problem that's behind that suggestion, Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, said in an interview with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. We have to make capitalism work for the majority of Americans. I don't know that we're in agreement on the mechanics.\n\n 'We're in agreement on the problem that's behind that suggestion. We have to make capitalism work for the majority of Americans. I don't know that we're in agreement on the mechanics.'  — — Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates\n\nDalio added, How tax rates are changed will have a huge effect on incentives and could have a huge effect on capital flows, and that will have big effects on markets and economies. It's going to be a bigger market-influencing issue than people now realize.\n\nOcasio-Cortez's mention in early January of a 70% tax on the wealthy provoked heated reaction from both supporters and detractors, with House Republican whip Steve Scalise deriding the idea as a leftist fantasy program.\n\nBut the debate sparked by the Democrat from New York also revealed some misunderstandings about how America's tax system works.\n\nMarginal vs. average tax rates\n\nOn CBS' 60 Minutes Ocasio-Cortez mentioned that historically America has had higher tax rates, and that in the 1960s, once you get to the tippy tops, on your 10 millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60% or 70%.\n\nThough Ocasio-Cortez added that the 70% rate wouldn't apply to all of that income, that detail seemed to get lost in the contentious aftermath. Her comments were widely interpreted as meaning that she wanted the federal government to take 70% of Americans' income in taxes, a view Scalise broadcast on Twitter TWTR, -1.47% .\n\n 'If you're Scrooge McDuck, hedge fund manager, much of your income comes from investments. It's coming from long-term capital gains or dividends, which are preferentially taxed.'  — —Mark Mazur, director of the Tax Policy Center\n\nBut as Ocasio-Cortez clarified in subsequent tweets, her 60 Minutes comments referred to the marginal tax rate.\n\nWhat does that mean? Here's the key distinction: Marginal tax rates are only applied to part of someone's income, not to all of their earnings. In other words, someone making $10 million would not lose 70% of that money to taxes under Ocasio-Cortez's proposal. A 70% marginal tax rate on earnings above $10 million would only apply to the portion of income above $10 million.\n\nA household's average tax rate — also called their effective tax rate — is the total share of their income that they pay in taxes.\n\nDon't miss:How the new tax law creates a 'perfect storm' for Roth IRA conversions\n\nFor example, if you were getting paid $11 million at your current job, only the last $1 million would be taxed at 70%, said Mark Mazur, director of the Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. The remainder would be taxed at lower tax rates used for lower incomes.\n\nIt's important to distinguish between the marginal tax rate and the average rate, Mazur told MarketWatch.\n\nA household's average tax rate — also called their effective tax rate — is the total share of their income that they pay in taxes. It's usually much lower than their top marginal rate, as this chart from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows.\n\nTax brackets vs. tax rates\n\nThis is where tax brackets come in. A tax bracket refers to the range of income that gets taxed at a particular rate.\n\nBut here's another critical point that gets lost in the social-media scrum: Just because you're in a 24% tax bracket doesn't mean your entire income is taxed at 24%. Under current tax law, if you were a single person, you would only pay that 24% rate in 2019 on income between $84,201 and $168,400.\n\n 'If this 70% tax bracket only applies to earned income, then it's only going to hit a very small slice of people who earn income above that level.'  — —Daniel Bunn, director of global projects at the Tax Foundation\n\nMarginal tax rates have fluctuated since income tax was established. The top marginal tax rate peaked at 92% in the early 1950s, according to the Tax Policy Center. In 2019, under the new tax law, the top marginal rate of 37% will apply to income above $510,300 for unmarried individuals, according to the Tax Foundation.\n\nThere is more than one way to tax the rich\n\nOcasio-Cortez's tax proposal is aimed at the super-rich, but when it comes to taxes, the super-rich are different from you and me, as F. Scott Fitzgerald may or may not have said. (And as MarketWatch reporter Brett Arends pointed out this week, they may also share many of the same qualities.)\n\nIncreasing taxes on earned income wouldn't necessarily hit the rich where it hurts the most.\n\nAs Mazur noted, when Americans envision a rich person they may think of an NFL player with a $22 million yearly salary. But in reality many of America's wealthy don't accrue their wealth from paychecks, also known as earned income.\n\nIf you're Scrooge McDuck, hedge fund manager, much of your income comes from investments, Mazur said. It's coming from long-term capital gains or dividends, which are preferentially taxed. (Long-term capital gains tax rates, for example, range from 0% to 20% this year.)\n\nIf this 70% tax bracket only applies to earned income, then it's only going to hit a very small slice of people who earn income above that level, said Daniel Bunn, director of global projects at the Tax Foundation.\n\nOne thing that's generally true is that folks that have income of $10 million or more, a lot of their income is what you would call unearned income: capital gains, or benefits from a business that you own or operate, and that may put you in a position where you're not necessarily taxed at what you might otherwise think based on the top marginal rate, he added.\n\nThose earning income above $10 million is a much narrower group than the top 1% — it probably amounts to fewer than 0.05% of households, Bunn said.\n\nDalio touched on that point in his comments at Davos. If we're to have a 70% marginal tax rate, most individuals affected by it will calculate whether they should instead operate as a corporation in order to convert ordinary income to capital gains, so I wonder how that will be handled, he said, according to CNBC. And I wonder what will be done to influence whether capital will leave the country.\n\nWho pays the most taxes?\n\nWhile there are examples of rich people in the United States paying very low average tax rates, our system is — on the whole — average rate progressive, said Daniel Hemel, an assistant law professor specializing in taxation at the University of Chicago law school. Average rate progressive means that average tax rates rise with income.\n\nFor 2019, the overall average tax rate (accounting for all types of federal taxes) is 31.1% for families in the top 0.1%, 25.2% for families in the top 10th of income earners, and 18.4% overall, Hemel said, citing Treasury Department data.\n\nThe top 1% of income earners paid an average tax rate of 26.9% in 2016, while the bottom 50% of income earners paid an average tax rate of 3.7%, according to IRS data, Bunn said.\n\nThis story was updated on Jan. 23, 2019.
Shares of Humana Inc. HUM, +1.15% dropped 2.5% in morning trade Monday, to pull back from the previous session's record close, after the health care company provided 2018 membership growth estimates. Following results of the annual enrollment period, the company raised its net membership growth estimate for individual Medicare Advantage products to 180,000 to 200,000 members from an initial estimate of 150,000 to 180,000 member, as a result of higher-than-expected retention of existing members. For prescription drug plans, however, membership is estimated to decline by 280,000 to 320,000 members. The decline is primarily a result of the loss of auto assign members in Florida and South Carolina, due to pricing over the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) low income benchmark, continued membership declines in its Enhanced Plan and significantly lower-than-anticipated growth in the co-branded plan with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -1.31% given low-priced competitor offerings. Separately, the company affirmed its adjusted 2017 earnings-per-share guidance of about $11.60, which compares with the FactSet consensus of $11.63, and said it expects the tax reform legislation to reduce fourth-quarter net earnings by about $160 million. The stock has gained 4.4% over the past three months, while the SPDR Health Care Select Sector ETF XLV, -0.21% has tacked on 2.3% and the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% has gained 7.6%.
Stocks ended higher Tuesday, taking back a chunk of the previous session's decline, as investors awaited the outcome of a pair of runoff elections in Georgia that will determine control of the U.S. Senate. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.58% rose around 168 points, or 0.6%, to close near 30,392, according to preliminary figures, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.29% gained around 26 points, or 0.7%, to end near 3,727. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.40% advanced around 121 points, or 0.9%, finishing near 12,819. Republicans will keep control of the upper chamber if they retain one of the two seats up for grabs in Tuesday's election. A Democratic sweep is seen giving President-elect Joe Biden room to push for a more aggressive round of fiscal stimulus after he takes office later this month, while also raising the prospect of a rollback of the 2017 corporate tax cut.
Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. was downgraded to neutral from overweight at Piper Jaffrey on Tuesday, with analysts citing a highly promotional holiday season and fewer likes on the brand's popular Instagram account.\n\nHoliday promotions cut across the handbag industry, according to analysts, though Michael Kors US:KORS and Kate Spade & Co. US:KATE, which Piper Jaffrey doesn't cover, were highlighted for being most discounted.\n\nSee also: Coach, Michael Kors, Kate Spade go deep on holiday weekend discounts\n\nHow Michael Kors Beat Coach at Its Own Game\n\nThough Michael Kors saw some success with its new All Access smartwatches, handbags underwhelmed, particularly at wholesale, from a conversion perspective, analysts said.\n\nFrom a handbag perspective, there has been very little differentiation (with the exception of Coach), and with stagnant dollars into the category, brands with newness and novelty will likely be the share gainers, the note said. While we recognize Michael Kors shares are inexpensive, we don't see any particularly positive catalyst in the near term for share to re-rate higher.\n\nPiper Jaffrey cut Michael Kors' price target to $48 from $60.\n\nMichael Kors, along with brands like Ralph Lauren Corp. RL, +1.16% , has been fighting discounting by reducing merchandise levels at department stores. Michael Kors beat expectations during the most recent period, but some analysts say it wasn't a good beat due to weak traffic.\n\nThese past two years, Michael Kors has protected its bottom line with its strong balance sheet and a lower-than-average tax rate (21%), said Piper Jaffray. With only $350 million left of the company's $2 billion buy-back authorization, analysts see less bottom-line support.\n\nWith wholesale contraction underway at Michael Kors, we see sales pressure into the first half of fiscal 2018, analysts wrote.\n\nRival handbag company Coach Inc. US:COH has also cut back on merchandise at department stores, which has hurt sales, but generated support from analysts. Analysts at Jefferies believe that handbags will be an irreplaceable category with high margins in 2017, and called out Michael Kors as a beneficiary.\n\nSee also:Abercrombie & Fitch downgraded on stalled turnaround, but Nike is tops for 2017\n\nRead also:Kate Spade is a strong takeover candidate for Coach, Michael Kors and others\n\nBesides the promotions, Piper Jaffray analysts called out Michael Kors' social media status in its downgrade note. Specifically, analysts say the company's Instagram engagement is declining.\n\nMichael Kors has 9.3 million Instagram followers.\n\nDuring Michael Kors' third quarter (the December quarter), Michael Kors saw 38% more followers year-over-year — however, the average 'likes' per post was down 24%, analysts wrote. Since the March quarter, we have seen Kors' engagement metrics as measured by 'likes' per post in the negative double-digit territory. This compared to Coach attracting 53% more followers in the December quarter with a 1% gain in 'likes' per post.\n\nCoach has just signed a $10 million deal with pop star Selena Gomez, who has 105 million Instagram followers.\n\nSee also: Here's why Selena Gomez may be worth $10 million to Coach\n\nSee also: Good luck finding luxury brands like Louis Vuitton, Hermes or even Tesla on sale
As polls show Americans are increasingly willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19, a new journal article says behavioral economics and consumer research can help inform vaccine-promotion efforts for people who remain hesitant.\n\nVaccine promoters will have to be creative in marshaling their resources and broad-minded in considering tools for addressing this enormous challenge, wrote authors Stacy Wood, a professor of marketing at NC State University, and Kevin Schulman, a professor of medicine at Stanford University, in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAbout 5.9 million people in the U.S. had received their first of two COVID-19 vaccine doses as of Thursday morning, according to the CDC, in a slower-than-expected rollout. Some 21.4 million doses had been distributed.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration in December granted emergency-use authorization to vaccines from Pfizer PFE and its German partner, BioNTech BNTX, and Moderna MRNA. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended that that states prioritize access for health-care workers and long-term-care facility residents while supply is limited.\n\nRecent survey research by the de Beaumont Foundation and pollster Frank Luntz found that family is the best motivator to get people vaccinated against COVID-19. Asked who they would be most willing to take the vaccine for other than themselves, 53% of respondents said they would do it for their family — far outstripping options like their country/America (20%), the economy (13%), their community (8%), and their friends (6%).\n\nAbout 62% of respondents said the statement getting vaccinated will help keep you, your family, your community, the economy and your country healthy and safe was the most convincing message to get vaccinated. Only 38% said the same of the statement taking the vaccine is the right thing to do for those entities.\n\nIt's more effective to emphasize the benefits of vaccination rather than moralizing and lecturing, the poll also found.\n\nTailored messages and 'wearable tokens'\n\nThe national strategy to boost COVID-19 vaccine uptake should consider targeting messages based on people's specific identity or social group-related barriers to getting the vaccine — for example, a blunt 'Go out with a bang, but don't die this death' campaign for groups with a Covid-defiant identity, they wrote.\n\nDifferent messages are needed to reach some people of color whose hesitancy stems from mistrust of the medical establishment, or older Republicans who are afraid to rock the boat.\n\nThe authors, drawing a parallel to the launch of Apple's AAPL, -0.65% iPod and its iconic white earbuds, also suggested that making it easy for consumers to observe that others had been vaccinated could help increase adoption. They suggested wearable tokens such as stickers, bracelets or pins, as well as digital badges on social media.\n\nAnalogies — like telling someone they're more likely to get struck by lightning than die from COVID-19 after being vaccinated, or likening mRNA, the molecule used in both authorized vaccines, to a teacher that shows the body how to make the antibodies that fight off Covid — can help convey complex information in a familiar way, the paper said.\n\nVaccine FOMO\n\nThe authors also raised the idea of treating vaccination as a desirable opportunity not to be missed, and creating rewards that inspire action based on FOMO (fear of missing out).\n\nEmployers could give employees the day off to get inoculated, insurance rebates and tax deductions could provide financial incentives, and colleges could hand out tickets to future events, they said.\n\nBased on research about consumers' tendency to seek compromise options like a medium-sized coffee, the authors suggested providing multiple vaccination options rather than a binary choice, and framing vaccination as a middle or normal choice. For example, vaccine promoters could ask people if they will get the vaccine later, get it now, or get it now and sign up to donate plasma, they said.\n\n Identifying a common enemy can also help, the authors added, noting the obvious threat of the virus. Since some people in the country still don't see the COVID-19 as a legitimate concern, public-health officials for now could focus on 'downstream effects' of the virus. \n\nOther recommended strategies included leveraging the natural scarcity of vaccines by painting those who get them first as nationally valued and honored.\n\nThis includes anticipating and addressing negative attributions, such as people from disadvantaged neighborhoods potentially feeling like they're being used as lab rats to test the vaccine; and reminding people of unlikely but high-stakes potential consequences of not getting vaccinated, like becoming a so-called long-hauler or losing a family member to the disease.\n\nIdentifying a common enemy can also help, the authors added, noting the obvious threat of the virus. Since some people in a polarized U.S. still don't see the COVID-19 as a legitimate concern, public-health officials for now could focus on downstream effects of the virus: We can focus on 'battling' poverty by getting people back to work or on 'racing' other countries to return to normal, they wrote.\n\nDifferent strategies might be more applicable for different health entities, Wood and Schulman wrote. Given [the] level of investment, skill, and good fortune in developing a vaccine, it will be tragic if we fail to curtail the virus because Americans refuse to be vaccinated, they added.\n\nWhile experts say it's still difficult to cite a definitive estimate for what percentage of the U.S. would need to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity against COVID-19, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci has suggested the number could be between 75% and 85%.
General Electric Co. shares extended their losses Wednesday, a day after the company announced a fourth quarter after-tax charge of $6.2 billion and a $3 billion cash capital contribution to its insurance subsidiary that will grow to $15 billion by 2024.\n\nOn a call with analysts, GE Chief Executive John L. Flannery said he was deeply disappointed at the magnitude of the charge in the company's legacy reinsurance portfolio.\n\nRead:GE's stock sinks after unveiling $6.2 billion charge in Q4\n\nGE's North America Life & Health is the reinsurance portfolio that the company retained after mostly exiting the business between 2004 and 2006. A reinsurer buys the right to receive premiums from the primary insurers that deal directly with consumers in exchange for eventually shouldering any potential losses. Those primary insurers underwrite and administer the policies and process claims when they come in.\n\nThe decision to retain the current insurance-related business, 60% of which is related to long-term care insurance, was based on the view that a gradual runoff of existing claims would be more profitable than selling the business, Flannery told analysts. GE has not taken on any new claims in the area since 2006, according to GE Capital Chief Risk Officer, Ryan Zanin, who was also on the call.\n\nFlannery's understated conclusion: In hindsight, GE underappreciated the risk in this book.\n\nGE stock GE, -2.65% was down 4% in midday trade Wednesday, and is down more than 20% over the past three months as a restructuring to return the company to profitability disappointed investors. The stock has lost more than 40% over the past 12 months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA DJIA, -0.46% has climbed 29.8% and the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% has added 23%.\n\nRead:GE's stock plunges again as another analyst abandons bullish view\n\nSee also:How to avoid the next GE — and find industrial winners of the future\n\nMore:GE's stock falls toward Fibonacci support level as charts suggest worst may be over\n\nGE says there are approximately 7 million long-term care policies in force across the industry but its market share is only about 4%. The entire industry, said Zanin, is experiencing more claims than originally estimated— more people are making claims and for a longer time than expected. Large numbers of policyholders who purchased long-term care insurance years ago are now reaching age 80 and over, the prime claim-paying period.\n\nIn 2017, economic and industry trends in the long-term care insurance business— how long people pay required premiums, how long people will live and how well they will live—prompted GE to initiate a review of its reserves, including whether it had enough regulatory capital for the business. GE hired two independent actuarial firms and its auditor of more than 100 years, KPMG, also reviewed the numbers as part of its annual audit process.\n\nJP Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa asked GE Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller if the company was happy with its auditor. If these guys reviewed this stuff every year for the last several years and this is kind of a result of that, doesn't that kind of raise questions?\n\nTrump Official: Medicaid Not Designed for Able-Bodied People\n\nMiller responded that the board assesses KPMG every year. There's no change planned at this time, but obviously that's something we look at every year.\n\nHowever, analyst Jeffrey Todd Sprague of Vertical Research Partners LLC followed up with his own questioning of the rigor of the effort. It is hard to imagine a $15 billion problem materialized in the course of a year.\n\nFlannery said he shared the surprise and deep disappointment of really this charge coming out of the legacy business.\n\nGE said that it had totally reconstructed its long-term care claims cost projections. Higher cost estimates combined with claims costs that now extend out over 40 years based on current life expectancies drove the multibillion-dollar after-tax GAAP reserve charge.\n\nSee:GE is reviewing its structure and may break up\n\nIn addition, since GE's North American Life and Health business is legally based in Kansas, it was that state's insurance regulator that had the last word on whether the business had enough capital to pay future claims. Capital reserves are calculated assuming moderately adverse conditions, rather than a more optimistic set of assumptions that can be used for financial statements prepared according to GAAP accounting standards.\n\nThe result is that GE Capital was required to fund an additional capital contribution of $3 billion in the first quarter of 2018 and approximately $2 billion annually from 2019 to 2024 for a total of about $15 billion.\n\nGE Capital did not pay a dividend to the GE parent company in the second half of 2017 and no dividend is planned for 2018. Flannery said he did not expect to see any dividends from GE Capital for the foreseeable future. GE Capital had approximately $31 billion in cash on its balance sheet at the end of 2017.
L Brands Inc. LB, -1.57% shares rose 2% in Tuesday premarket trading after it was upgraded to outperform from neutral at Baird Equity Research on the company's 2018 earnings-per-share growth potential. Baird raised its price target to $70 from $60. Analysts led by Mark Altschwager think the Victoria's Secret brand is turning a corner under new leadership and there's steady momentum at Bath & Body Works. Baird expects Victoria's Secret to exceed December same-store sales and fourth-quarter EPS expectations thanks to solid traffic and sales. Recent tax reforms should be a tailwind. And Baird is bullish about the company's store strategy, which includes selective expansion of Victoria's Secret square footage in order to grow core categories. Analysts note that the majority of stores don't carry the full lingerie or popular Pink collections. L Brands shares are down 8.5% for the last year while the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% is up 19.4% for the period.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has decided to push for online sports wagering in his state.\n\nNew York has the potential to be the largest sports wagering market in the United States, and by legalizing online sports betting we aim to keep millions of dollars in tax revenue here at home, which will only strengthen our ability to rebuild from the COVID-19 crisis, Cuomo said in a statement.\n\nCuomo had long pushed back against the idea of legalizing online sports betting, but events surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic seem to have changed his mind.\n\nSee also: The Red Cross is giving away Super Bowl tickets to attract much needed plasma donations\n\nAt a time when New York faces a historic budget deficit due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the current online sports wagering structure incentivizes a large segment of New York residents to travel out of state to make online sports wagers or continue to patronize black markets, Cuomo said.\n\nCuomo will give more details on the future of online sports wagering in New York during his State of the State address next week.\n\nNew York's neighbor New Jersey has become an online sports wagering juggernaut in the past year, taking in over $4 billion in sports bets in 2020, according to the state. These bets generated $36.5 million in tax revenue for New Jersey.\n\nFour casinos in upstate New York currently accept sports bets, but those bets are in-person only and only a small fraction of what online betting would be in the state. Over 90% of all bets made in New Jersey are made online, according to public data.
Consumer prices rose about 2.1% in 2017, driven higher by the usual factors: The price of owning or renting a home, the price of filling the gas tank and the price of filling your belly.\n\nOf course, the prices of some things fell: Wireless phone services were down sharply, and the costs of many manufactured goods, such as clothes, cars, hi-tech gadgets and furniture, dropped as well.\n\nAlso read:Higher rents and home prices drive increase in consumer prices\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics makes it easy to see which items had the largest impact—positive and negative—on the consumer price index. It publishes Table 7 in each month's report, detailing how much the change in price for each item contributed to or subtracted from the CPI.\n\nThe idea here is that things that consumers spend a lot of money on have a bigger weight in the CPI. About one-third of consumer spending goes for owning or renting a home, so it follows that even a relatively modest 3.2% rise in rental prices is going to have a bigger impact on your wallet than, say, a 15% rise in fuel-oil prices (which accounts for about 0.1% of the typical consumer's budget).\n\nThe chart at the top of the page shows the 10 items that had the largest positive impact on the CPI in 2017, led by home ownership prices, which contributed 0.75 percentage points to the 2.1% rise in the CPI. Looked at another way, if ownership prices had been unchanged for the year, the CPI would have risen just 1.35% (2.1% minus 0.75%).\n\nGasoline prices jumped 10.7% in 2017. Although gas accounts for just 3.6% of aggregate consumer spending, that large price increase boosted the CPI by 0.35 percentage points. The prices of food to be consumed at home rose 1.6%, but because food accounts for a somewhat larger 13.6% of spending, even that modest increase was enough to boost the CPI by 0.07 percentage points.\n\nOther notable increases that hit consumers' wallets hard: car insurance prices rose 7.9%, cable TV prices (fueled by Netflix's NFLX, -3.75% new pricing) rose 4.8%, hospital services prices increased 5.1% and tobacco prices jumped 6.5%, mostly because of a big increase in the cigarette tax in California.\n\nBy contrast, items with falling prices had a much smaller impact on the CPI. The biggest drag on the CPI came from wireless phone services, which fell 10.2% as AT&T T, -0.46% and Verizon VZ, +1.00% switched to unlimited data plans in response to competition from smaller rivals Sprint US:S and T-Mobile TMUS, -1.88% . That's going to be a one-off event, part of what Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen has said is the transitory disinflation in a few items that could be masking broader inflation risks.\n\nSimilarly, prices of new and used cars also fell during the year, but have risen over the past few months.\n\nIs Amazon Going to Rule the World?\n\nPrices of other manufactured goods—apparel, computers, TVs, furniture and toys—have declined for decades and may continue to do so.\n\nLooking ahead, the CPI will be driven higher or lower by a few large categories of spending: shelter, food, energy and medical care combined account for 68% of the CPI. Those are the items to keep your eye on.
BRUSSELS — McDonald's Corp. could face fresh regulatory headwinds in Europe after three Italian consumer groups filed an antitrust complaint with the European Union alleging that the fast-food chain imposes illegal terms on its franchisees.\n\nThe complaint, which is supported by U.S. and European trade unions, alleges that McDonald's MCD, -0.41% abuses its dominant market position and harms consumers by charging its franchisees rents that exceed market rates by up to 10 times, and by limiting their ability to switch to other brands.
As $600 stimulus checks roll out, some Americans are anxiously awaiting their own direct payments to hit their bank account or show up in their mailbox.\n\nThat wait could be awhile in some circumstances — and offer little comfort for those who need the money right now.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service said Tuesday it's not going to re-issue $600 payments that come back to the agency if a bank account listed on a 2019 tax return is now closed or inactive.\n\nInstead, the would-be recipients will have to claim the amount when they file their taxes this year, according to the IRS. It's just as someone would have to do if they didn't get the $1,200 payment in the early spring's first round of payments.\n\nThe IRS isn't engaging in do-overs on the $600 checks because another tax-filing season is approaching. The tax collection agency says it has to act fast under a compressed timeline. (The IRS did have a process to claim missing or stymied checks for the $1,200 payments.)\n\nLearn more here about how to claim the money.\n\nThe IRS and the Treasury Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on when tax season starts this year. Last year, the IRS started accepting and processing returns on Jan. 27.\n\nDon't miss: Meet the Americans who are first in line to file their taxes\n\nThe IRS said it couldn't re-issue stymied stimulus checks and also explained what various responses mean on the 'Get My Payment' portal.\n\nIf the portal says Payment Status #2 – Not Available, the second economic impact payment isn't coming and the person will have to claim it on their taxes.\n\nIf the portal shows a direct deposit date and a part of an account, that's where the money is.\n\nIf it says the payment was mailed, it could take between three and four weeks for the paper check or a pre-paid debit card to show up in the mail.\n\nThe Get My Payment tool is in heavy demand, the IRS said. Once it reaches an unspecified maximum number of accesses, the portal will tell users to check back the next day. Bear in mind the portal is updated once a day, so status information won't change between the morning and afternoon.\n\nThe IRS started mailing approximately 8 million debit cards this week loaded with the economic impact payments. Over the summer, some people receiving the first round of payments accidentally threw out the debit cards, thinking they were junk mail.\n\nThis time, the Treasury Department and IRS tried leaving nothing to chance and included pictures of the card and envelope. A picture of the card and its envelope can be found here. Some people getting paper checks in the first round might receive a pre-paid card this time and vice versa, the Treasury Department said.\n\nThe IRS is working hard to deliver the second Economic Impact Payment quickly, as required by law, while still preparing for the upcoming 2021 tax filing season, the agency said, adding it turned around the second round of payments in record time.\n\nThe IRS started the direct deposit process last Tuesday and the mailing process last Wednesday. The agency recommends that once tax season starts, people should file their taxes electronically to quicken processing.\n\nAround early December, the IRS was still trying to get out from under a backlog in paper mail correspondence, including approximately 1 million unprocessed 2019 paper returns filed via mail. The agency closed down its physical offices for several months as the pandemic first hit in early spring.
Netflix Inc. is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings after the bell on Monday, and analysts will likely scour the books for any insight into how its most recent price increases have impacted growth.\n\nIn October, Netflix said it was raising the cost of two of its subscription plans—the lowest tier remained at $7.99.\n\nSee:Netflix is raising the cost of subscriptions again\n\nThe price increases were rolled out to existing subscribers through the fourth quarter, which means this earnings report will be the first to reflect the changes.\n\nAnalysts and investors have repeatedly called for Netflix to raise prices and boost revenue. However, price increases must be carefully handled to avoid churn, or subscribers cancelling their subscriptions.\n\nAnalysts at Raymond James said that Netflix has rarely increased prices without experiencing some impact on the business.\n\nA Brief History of Cable: Creating and Cutting the Cord\n\nEvercore analysts took a different tack, noting that Netflix's domestic price is still deeply discounted—roughly 40% below cable and satellite companies on a price-to-viewership basis.\n\n[That] suggests the service still has substantial room to implement further price increases, lead Evercore analyst Vijay Jayant wrote in a recent note.\n\nAnalysts following the stock expect Netflix to report net additions of 1.27 million subscribers in the quarter. That's down from an estimated 1.35 million additions analysts were expecting at the end of October, but it's slightly above the 1.25 million subscriber additions guidance from Netflix.\n\nWhile Netflix raised prices in the quarter, it also had a number of significant show and film releases, including the second seasons of Stranger Things and The Crown, as well as the movie Bright. Big releases tend to attract new subscribers and help retain existing ones.\n\nSee:Did Netflix choose the perfect time for a price increase?\n\nAlso read:Netflix wants exclusive rights to films, shows and the talent creating them\n\nAnalysts will also focus on guidance for subscriber growth for the 2018 first quarter.\n\nWe think the 2018 first quarter domestic subscriber guidance will drive the domestic pricing power narrative for better or for worse, Jayant wrote.\n\nHere's what investors can expect:\n\nEarnings: The streaming giant is expected to report earnings of 41 cents, according to analysts tracked by FactSet. That would be a more than 173% improvement compared with the same quarter a year ago, and roughly a 41% increase compared with the third quarter. Netflix has beaten FactSet's consensus on earnings in seven of the last 10 quarters.\n\nEstimize, which crowdsources estimates from sell-side and buy-side analysts, hedge-fund managers, executives, academics and others, expects Netflix to report per-share earnings of 43 cents.\n\nRevenue: Revenue is expected to be $3.28 billion for the quarter, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet. That would be a 32% improvement compared with the same quarter a year ago, and up nearly 10% from the most recent quarter. Analysts' revenue expectations break down to $1.62 billion from domestic streaming, $1.54 billion from international streaming, and $105 million from the company's domestic DVD business. Netflix has missed FactSet's consensus on revenue in six of the last 10 quarters.\n\nEstimize expects Netflix to report revenue of $3.29 billion.\n\nCheck out:Netflix gives some top executives big raise in salary, citing new tax law\n\nShare price: Analysts covering the stock have an average 12-month price target of $219.66, representing a less than 1% premium to the stock's current trading level. The analysts also, on average, rate Netflix as overweight, which is the equivalent to a buy rating.\n\nShares of Netflix are up close to 65% in the last 12 months. By comparison, the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% is up nearly 24%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% is up almost 32% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% is up more than 32%.\n\nOther issues: Questions about Netflix's ability to maintain its industry dominance have surrounded the company as Walt Disney Co. DIS, -1.52% seeks to absorb film and TV entertainment assets from 21st Century Fox Inc. FOXA, -0.09% , while also planning a streaming service competitor.\n\nA Disney-Fox combined media company backing a streaming service—the company will also hold a larger share in Hulu—is expected to make for a more compelling competitor to Netflix.\n\nThe Los Gatos, Calif. company, however, has maintained its view on competition, welcoming new entrants to the internet streaming landscape and saying there is plenty of consumer time for multiple companies to be successful.\n\nIt's an exciting period and both media and technology companies see the same big opportunity as we do, Netflix management said in its third quarter letter to shareholders. We have a good head start, but our job is to improve Netflix as rapidly as possible.\n\nRead:Netflix won't get beat by a combined Disney-Fox company, analyst says\n\nDaniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights, wrote that the Disney-Fox deal poses a threat to Netflix, potentially mining some of its market share.\n\nOne way that the competition between the two is playing out is in content. Disney has already said it will remove its content from Netflix with the launch of its streaming service. Whether it will now also snatch away Fox content is not clear.\n\nA Disney-Fox combined company, however, is a much bigger opponent in future content bidding wars.\n\nNetflix has already shattered its piggy bank, going deeper into debt to continue producing and buying the original content necessary to help keep the business attractive.\n\nAlso read:How 'Bright' compares to some of 2017's biggest box office openings\n\nCheck out:Netflix signs exclusive multi-year deal with 'Planet of the Apes' director Matt Reeves\n\nWe expect Netflix to burn cash to fund content acquisition for many years, notwithstanding the fact that it has increased price three times while cash bun continues to grow, wrote Netflix bear Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush We don't expect Netflix to become meaningfully profitable on a cash basis for several years, and we don't expect positive free cash flow for the remainder of this decade.\n\nWe think that Netflix is destined to be a cash-burning, high-growth company until it changes its strategy and accepts its fate as a highly profitable, slow-growth company.
It seems like I'm falling behind my friends financially. They take nicer vacations and drive more expensive cars than mine. How am I really doing compared with others my age?\n\nIt happens every morning, from Wichita to Washington: We wake up feeling good. We pick up our phones and scroll through Instagram.\n\nWe guess at the carat weight of a college friend's engagement ring and marvel at a cousin's shiny new truck. We're lifted into tornadoes of jealousy over photos of a friend's puppy. We puzzle over how they afford it.\n\nBut this social media highlight reel leaves a lot out.\n\nYou don't find people posting about missing a rent payment, says Doug Amis, a certified financial planner and president at Cardinal Retirement Planning, Inc. in Cary, North Carolina.\n\nHere's all you need to do in your 30s for a great financial future\n\nKnow where you really stand\n\nIf you're under 35, here's how your peers are really doing, according to the Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances:\n\nThe median income for families with a head of household under 35 was $40,500 in 2016. Nearly half of families under 35 had credit card balances, with median debt of $1,400 per family. About 42% of families under 35 had retirement accounts, and their median value was $12,300.\n\n You don't find people posting about missing a rent payment,  — Doug Amis, certified financial planner and president, Cardinal Retirement Planning\n\nLastly, about 45% of families with a head of household under 35 had education debt. The median amount was $18,500 per family, but the amount varies widely by income level and highest degree attained.\n\nFollow rules of thumb, not Instagram\n\nYou won't find a real answer to how you're doing in a Federal Reserve survey or a social media feed.\n\nYou will find it by measuring yourself against rules of thumb, refined over decades and endorsed by financial pros, that point the way toward true financial health. Start with these:\n\nDo you have an emergency fund of at least $500? It should eventually include three to six months of basic expenses.\n\nAre you paying down high-interest debt, like credit cards and personal loans? That should come before attacking lower-interest debt like student loans.\n\nDo you spend less than you earn? A budget based on the 50/30/20 rule can help: You'll spend no more than 50% of after-tax income on necessities, no more than 30% on wants and at least 20% on savings and debt repayment.\n\nDo you follow the 28/36 rule? Lenders use this to qualify you for a mortgage, but Amis suggests it's also a helpful way to assess cash flow even if you're years from buying a home. Housing costs should be less than 28% of your pretax income. With other debt payments, like credit card, car or student loan bills, the total should come under 36% of pretax income.\n\nDo you save for retirement? Socking away 10% to 15% of your pretax income is the goal.\n\nThese guidelines are aspirational. But your progress toward them is a better measure of whether your money is working for you than surveys or Instagram. In the end, your financial well-being boils down to whether you can meet your basic needs today, plan for a better tomorrow and enjoy life as you go.\n\nSet your own goals\n\nWhile these best-case scenarios might not seem feasible right now, don't wait to start saving until you can set aside the amount you feel you're supposed to, says Emily Guy Birken, author of End Financial Stress Now. For instance, save even 1% of your income for retirement if that's all you can afford. Increase the amount by 1% every six months as you get accustomed to having less in your paycheck — or at least whenever you get a raise.\n\nAnd most important, set your own goals — when to buy a house, say, or how quickly to pay off student loans — based on what you value most. While some friends may take fancy vacations, they may also have massive credit card debt you don't know about.\n\nBesides, Birken says, Would you really choose to have all of their problems, and have all of their foibles, flaws and issues, just because they've got one thing you don't have?\n\nMore from NerdWallet:
U.S. stocks kicked off 2018 on a positive note Tuesday, with major indexes rallying to record levels in a broad rally that saw five of the 11 primary sectors gaining more than 1% on the day.\n\nThe energy sector was a particular outperformer, jumping 1.8%, while both consumer discretionary and material names were up 1.5%. Technology stocks, the best-performing sector of 2017, extended their advance by rising 1.4%, a rally that helped give the Nasdaq its biggest one-day percentage rise since Nov. 16.\n\nWhat are stock indexes doing?\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% rose 105 points, or 0.4%, to 24,824. The S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% rose 22 points, or 0.8%, to 2,696. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% gained 103.5 points, or 1.5%, to 7,007.\n\nBoth the S&P and the Nasdaq hit intraday records in the final minutes of trading. They also ended at closing records, with the Nasdaq finishing above 7,000 for the first time in its history. The Dow is less than half a percentage point below its own record.\n\nThe three indexes are coming off strong gains in 2017; the S&P 500 rose 19.4% for the year, the Dow gained 25.1% and the Nasdaq added 28.2%. All three posted their best year since 2013, and they continue to trade within 1 percentage point of records.\n\nRead:These are all the records stock indexes hit with 2017 trading at a close\n\nDon't miss:The Dow is coming off an annual gain of 25%—here's what typically happens next\n\nWhat drove the market?\n\nChip makers were among the biggest boosts to the technology sector. Advanced Micro Devices AMD, -5.46% jumped 6.8%, while Micron Technology MU, -5.21% was up 6.2%. Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -4.64% gained 3%. The PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX, -4.24% rose 2.8%.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, -0.07% jumped 1.9% and hit an all-time intraday high.\n\nThe day's gain came despite ongoing geopolitical uncertainty. Iran was in focus after nine people were reported dead after overnight clashes between protesters and security forces. The protests started last week over rising inflation and corruption, but focus has since shifted to a wider discontent with Iran's ruling system and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The wave of unrest is now seen as the largest since a disputed 2009 presidential election, and it could filter into markets if it results in any kind of disruption to the region's oil industry.\n\nIn North Korea, leader Kim Jong Un said in a speech Monday that Pyongyang had completed its nuclear weapons program, which he claimed would allow a missile to reach any point in the continental U.S. Kim, however, also suggested he was willing to engage in talks with South Korea, saying North Korea would be open to sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics in the South next month.\n\nThe government in Seoul welcomed Kim's suggestion on Tuesday. Its unification minister proposed holding high-level talks with North Korean officials on Jan. 9 to discuss the country's possible involvement in the Winter Games and Kim Jong Un's nuclear program.\n\nOne factor supporting equities was a slumping U.S. dollar. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.13% fell for a fifth straight session, down 0.3% at 91.886 to trade around its lowest level since September. A weak dollar is considered a tailwind for the profitability of large U.S. multinationals.\n\nWhat are strategists saying?\n\nThe gains we saw last year were pretty amazing, and it's hard to imagine that we could replicate that success. However, growth has been subpar and we just got a fundamental change to the tax code. As those themes mature, we could see the rally persist, and it's reasonable to believe we could have another up market this year, said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago.\n\nBattle said that all valuations are really high, but that you can make a reasonable case that the tech sector has more upside in it given the pervasiveness of tech in the modern economy. Chipmakers, in particular, he said, are going to lead the charge this year, calling them a foundational building block in the market's biggest sector.\n\nOptimism over U.S. markets has been rising despite valuations that are seen as stretched by many measures. The latest AAII investor sentiment survey indicates that 50.5% of polled investors are bullish on the market, meaning they expect prices will be higher in six months. That's the highest level in nearly two years, and significantly above the 38.5% historical average. The number of bullish investors has gone up by 5.5 percentage points in the past week alone, while the percentage of bearish investors has dropped to 25.6%, down 2.5 percentage points over the past week.\n\nRead more: Stock optimism swells as S&P 500 hits most overbought level in 22 years\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nShares of Abbott Laboratories ABT, +0.42% rose 3% after J.P. Morgan lifted the health care company to overweight from neutral.\n\nNetflix Inc. NFLX, -3.75% rose 4.8% after Macquarie lifted the online-streaming company to outperform, according to Dow Jones Newswires.\n\nIncyte Corp. INCY, -2.43% climbed 6.5% after RBC Capital Markets raised its rating on the biotech company to outperform from sector perform.\n\nAmong the most active stocks in the energy space, Noble Energy Inc. US:NBL rose 3.6% while Chesapeake Energy Corp. CHK, -3.93% was up 3.5%. Marathon Oil Corp. MRO, -8.40% was up 2.7%.\n\nWhat does the economic data say?\n\nThe final reading of the U.S. manufacturing purchasing manager's index for December came in at 55.1, compared with a preliminary reading of 55.0. A figure of more than 50 indicates an expansion in activity.\n\nSee:MarketWatch's economic calendar\n\nWhat are other markets doing?\n\nStock markets in Asia closed mainly higher, while European equity markets kicked off the new year on the back foot.\n\nMetals were mostly higher. Gold prices US:GCG8 rose 0.8%, while copper US:HGH8 rose 0.2%.\n\nBitcoin futures US:BTCF8 rose 3.6% to $14,990.
Calls for the end of a more-than-three-decade bull market in bonds have been frequent of late. That has been particularly the case in the wake of President-elect Donald Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton in November, which resulted in a bond selloff that pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to around 2.60% in December from a low of 1.36% in July.\n\nSee:Deutsche Bank says 35-year party is over for bond bulls\n\nThough that downward spiral for bond prices (yields rise as bond prices fall) has abated somewhat, prominent bond investor Bill Gross says the 10-year yield remains the most important factor in financial markets.\n\nThe former head of Pimco and present manager of Janus Capital's global unconstrained bond fund said if the yield on the 10-year note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.711% decisively surpasses 2.60%, representing the top of the trend in yields, that will mark the end of the bull market in bonds, which has huge implications for a host of assets, including stocks. Gross's warning comes in his latest missive to investors, with an excerpt below:\n\nAnd this is my only forecast for the 10-year in 2017. If 2.60% is broken on the upside—if yields move higher than 2.60%—a secular bear bond market has begun. Watch the 2.6% level. Much more important than Dow 20,000. Much more important than $60-a-barrel oil. Much more important that the Dollar/Euro parity at 1.00. It is the key to interest rate levels and perhaps stock price levels in 2017\n\nIs this more important than the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% hitting 20,000? Is it more important than the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% rising further into record territory and West Texas Intermediate crude-oil prices CLG27, retaking $60 a barrel, a level it hasn't seen in about 18 months? More influential than the U.S. dollar EURUSD, -0.01% , most recently at 1.05, possibly hitting parity with the euro?\n\nGross thinks so. After all, the benchmark bond influences nearly every corner of markets.\n\nThe shift in trend in bond yields is predicated on the belief that Trump's policies, including increased fiscal spending and tax cuts among other proposals, will provide a boost to inflation—the enemy of long-term bonds because it erodes the value of fixed-interest payments. Gross notes that a widening divergence between the dovish monetary policies in Europe and those that are tilting toward normalization in the U.S., are expected to cap upside potential for the 10-year yield.\n\nThat is why Gross believes that the 2.60% top is important.\n\nMoreover, a climb in yields has implications for stocks that have run-up over the past several months amid hope that Trump will make good on his promises. Higher yields can make the perceived safety of U.S. government bonds more attractive to buyers of comparatively risky stocks. Higher rates also can weigh on the economy by raising the cost of mortgages and boosting corporate borrowing costs.\n\nStill, those rising yields might be manageable if it means that U.S. economic growth is humming along. And elevated rates are a boon for banks which borrow on a short-term basis and lend long-term. Gross thinks the growth trajectory remains unclear and that gross domestic product needs to touch an annual rate of 3% to help to boost corporate profits rather than the 2% rate GDP has hovered around over the past decade.\n\nTo be sure, not everyone believes that 2.60% is a magic demarcation point for Treasurys. Rival bond expert, Jeff Gundlach, who runs DoubleLine Capital, has said the benchmark 10-year yield needs to hit 3% to begin to challenge appetite for stocks and mark the end of a line of declining peaks in yields.

U.S. stocks opened sharply higher on Tuesday, with major indexes hitting their latest in a string of records and the Dow breaking through its latest 1,000-point milestone. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% rose 215 points, or 0.9%, to 26,025. The S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% added 15 points, or 0.5%, to 2,801. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% added 52 points, or 0.7%, to 7,312. Corporate earnings were a main driver of trading, both UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, +2.80% and banking heavyweight Citigroup Inc. C, +0.33% were among the stocks that reported. Shares of UnitedHealth rose 2.7% while Citigroup gained 1.4%. Separately, General Electric Co. GE, -2.65% fell 2% after the conglomerate said a review of GE Capital's insurance portfolio would result in a $6.2 billion after-tax charge in the fourth quarter.
Such is the distrust toward polls that the late move toward the Democrats in the Georgia Senate runoff elections was treated with skepticism on Wall Street.\n\nSo financial markets have reacted to the news Raphael Warnock won one of two Senate runoffs in Georgia early on Wednesday, with Jon Ossoff leading the other and the votes remaining to be counted centered in counties around Atlanta. That puts the Democrats on the precipice of control of an evenly divided U.S. Senate, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris getting the tiebreaking vote.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.660% rose as high as 1.04% in expectations of greater spending. The dollar fell, with the euro EURUSD, -0.13% trading over $1.23.\n\nFutures on the small-cap Russell 2000 RTY00, -0.01% rose, while broader S&P 500 futures ES00, +0.05% and Nasdaq-100 futures NQ00, +0.02% fell, with technology giants including Facebook FB, +1.69% , Google owner Alphabet GOOG, -0.07% and Microsoft MSFT, -0.28% trading lower in premarket action on fears of regulatory action. A cannabis ETF MJ, +1.35% rallied.\n\nWhile these probable victories raise the level of political uncertainty and certain sectors of the U.S. equity market may underperform (health care, tech for example), the macro implications of these election outcomes are clearly positive, said Derek Halpenny, head of research for global markets at MUFG Bank in London. There is now a chance of larger stimulus checks for U.S. households ($2,000 instead of $600) and an increased prospect of larger fiscal stimulus support in general going forward.\n\nIf the Democrats manage to pull off the upsets in Georgia, then a key difference this time around, in my view, is that many of those same Democrat players who were there in 2009 would likely use their latest opportunity to advance greater fiscal spending to support the economic recovery. In a more-pronounced economic recovery, we would expect an even further rise in Treasury rates, tightening of municipal and corporate bond spreads, weakening of the dollar, and higher performance of value stocks and emerging market equities, added Brian Levitt, global market strategist at Invesco, in a note ahead of the results.\n\nThe steepening yield curve — the gap between 2- and 10-year yields surged to the widest since 2017 — should help the banking sector. Shares of JPMorgan Chase JPM, +1.03% rose in premarket trade.\n\nOne big question will be whether there will be a desire to raise taxes on corporations or wealthy Americans, a move advocated by President-elect Joe Biden.\n\nAlthough a 'blue sweep' with a Democratic win in Georgia result may revive a discussion about U.S. tax hikes to come, we consider it unlikely that the new Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen would pursue policies that could stifle the U.S. economic recovery. Given her dovish leaning, her focus will likely be on more stimulus instead, said Holger Schmeiding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank.\n\nThe buzz\n\nVice President Mike Pence will certify the congressional tally of Electoral College votes, as President Donald Trump publicly lobbied him to overturn the result.\n\nThe minutes of the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting will be published, as the public comments from various officials in recent days show a split on the issue of bond purchases.

Saying no might be one of the healthiest decisions you can make in your 50s and 60s. That's because your physical and mental health is directly correlated to the activities and tasks you sign up for. All of us are given 24 hours in a day and we need to choose wisely.\n\nNot surprisingly, boomers are not very good at saying no. We're card-carrying members of the Sandwich Generation — often caring for aging parents at the same time as our partners and grown children. We're not ones to turn away from an opportunity to chair a committee for a cause dear to our hearts, which may coincide with taking Mom or Dad to frequent doctor appointments.\n\nWe're famous for relishing long workweeks and we take parenting to a new level, ever-involved in our children and grandchildren's lives, whether by invitation or not. And so we avoid conflict by saying yes to multiple requests for babysitting, volunteering, caregiving for an aging parent and taking on extra projects at work, because we don't want to let others down or make ourselves look bad.\n\nWe avoid saying no because we are human and wired for pleasure, avoiding, at all costs, confrontational conversations. And so, in the short term, we mostly say yes—a temporary feel-good measure that often results in tensions simmering at a slow boil. When stress levels rise, our resentment returns with a vengeance.\n\nThe stress of yes\n\nPortland State University's Institute on Aging studied 650 adults over a two-year period and discovered prolonged conflict was significantly associated with a high number of negative health conditions, as stress dampens the immune system. When we're saying yes to requests that we'd much rather avoid, it pushes our beliefs and behaviors out of harmony. This kind of cognitive dissonance causes horrible discomfort and irritability—a vicious circle that results in depression, anxiety, even Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, according to The British Journal of Psychiatry.\n\nSo how do we learn to say NO with grace?\n\nIt starts with valuing the importance of what saying no means to our daily lives. Whether we are retired or still part of the workforce, we need to acknowledge that our time is precious currency that should be spent with great care. We want our days to be filled with a variety of familial, civic and work-related responsibilities that we highly honor.\n\nAlso read: Retirees will continue to face headwinds in 2019\n\nBut we need to also honor the responsibility we have to ourselves, which includes getting enough sleep, exercising, feeding ourselves spiritually and generally recharging. When we start to say no to requests that are ancillary, we are essentially saying yes to what renews us.\n\nOvercoming guilt feelings\n\nIf we paid better attention to the instances when we did muster the courage to say no, we'd realize that our world did not implode and our loved ones did not excommunicate us from family gatherings. Instead, we pay the greatest attention to the rare occasion when someone did push back on us with a vengeance and we felt guilty. The truth is that our friends, relatives and bosses usually accept our decision to say no. It helps to observe how others effectively say no, as well. When we watch them carry on with little repercussion, the lesson is learned. When you finally consider what's important and realize that saying no to others holds your values in high esteem, you'll be more inclined to eliminate unwanted, unnecessary obligations in your life.\n\nIf you're feeling pressured to sign up for something you are unsure you really want to do, simply buy some time. Let the requester know that you need to check your calendar before you commit to anything. Then take the time to evaluate whether you want to agree or otherwise. Or simply say that you need some time to think about it — and let them know when you will make your decision. Ghosting them without a decision will only prolong your stress—make sure you give them a decision when promised.\n\nPay attention to ebbs and flows\n\nThere's light at the end of this tunnel. Saying no gives you the bandwidth to start building your criteria for yes projects: lost passions or hobbies like art or music, activities that jazz you such as tuning into nature, or things that will be important to you later in life, such as downsizing your possessions so that you can someday move to your dream destination.\n\nDon't miss: Why new tax rules make Roth accounts better than ever\n\nRemember that there's a silver lining when you are pulled by multiple requests for your energy and time. When you feel stretched too thin, it means that your life is enriched with people and meaningful work that needs you.\n\nBut those with the fullest of lives will have busy periods and lulls as well. When requests for your time get out of hand, reminding yourself that this too shall pass may help you manage the ebbs and flows. By saying no wisely, you can prioritize your time through the busy stretches.
NEW YORK (Project Syndicate) — It's old news that large segments of society have become deeply unhappy with what they see as the establishment, especially the political class. The Yellow Vest protests in France, triggered by President Emmanuel Macron's move to hike fuel taxes in the name of combating climate change, are but the latest example of the scale of this alienation.\n\nThere are good reasons for today's disgruntlement: four decades of promises by political leaders of both the center-left and center-right, espousing the neoliberal faith that globalization, financialization, deregulation, privatization, and a host of related reforms would bring unprecedented prosperity, have gone unfulfilled.\n\nWhile a tiny elite seems to have done very well, large swaths of the population have fallen out of the middle class and plunged into a new world of vulnerability and insecurity. Even leaders in countries with low but increasing inequality have felt their public's wrath.\n\nBy the numbers, France looks better than most, but it is perceptions, not numbers, that matter; even in France, which avoided some of the extremism of the Reagan-Thatcher era, things are not going well for many.\n\nPeter Morici:Britain should quit Europe and unilaterally declare free trade\n\nWhen taxes on the very wealthy are lowered, but raised for ordinary citizens to meet budgetary demands (whether from far-off Brussels or from well-off financiers), it should come as no surprise that some are angry. The Yellow Vests' refrain speaks to their concerns: The government talks about the end of the world. We are worried about the end of the month.\n\nThere is, in short, a gross mistrust in governments and politicians, which means that asking for sacrifices today in exchange for the promise of a better life tomorrow won't pass muster. And this is especially true of trickle down policies: tax cuts for the rich that eventually are supposed to benefit everyone else.\n\nWhen I was at the World Bank, the first lesson in policy reform was that sequencing and pacing matter. The promise of the Green New Deal that is now being championed by progressives in the United States gets both of these elements right.\n\nThe Green New Deal is premised on three observations: First, there are unutilized and underutilized resources — especially human talent — that can be used effectively. Second, if there were more demand for those with low and medium skills, their wages and standards of living would rise. Third, a good environment is an essential part of human wellbeing, today and in the future.\n\nIf the challenges of climate change are not met today, huge burdens will be imposed on the next generation. It is just wrong for this generation to pass these costs on to the next. It is better to leave a legacy of financial debts, which our children can somehow manage, than to hand down a possibly unmanageable environmental disaster.\n\nAlmost 90 years ago, President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to the Great Depression with his New Deal, a bold package of reforms that touched almost every aspect of the American economy.\n\nBut it is more than the symbolism of the New Deal that is being invoked now. It is its animating purpose: putting people back to work, in the way that FDR did for the U.S., with its crushing unemployment of the time. Back then, that meant investments in rural electrification, roads, and dams.\n\nEconomists have debated how effective the New Deal was — its spending was probably too low and not sustained enough to generate the kind of recovery the economy needed. Nonetheless, it left a lasting legacy by transforming the country at a crucial time.\n\nSo, too, for a Green New Deal: It can provide public transportation, linking people with jobs, and retrofit the economy to meet the challenge of climate change. At the same time, these investments themselves will create jobs.\n\nIt has long been recognized that decarbonization, if done correctly, would be a great job creator, as the economy prepares itself for a world with renewable energy. Of course, some jobs — for example, those of the 53,000 coal miners in the U.S. — will be lost, and programs are needed to retrain such workers for other jobs.\n\nTo return to the refrain: sequencing and pacing matter. It would have made more sense to begin with creating new jobs before the old jobs were destroyed, to ensure that the profits of the oil and coal companies were taxed, and the hidden subsidies they receive eliminated, before asking those who are barely getting by to pony up more.\n\nThe Green New Deal sends a positive message of what government can do, for this generation of citizens and the next. It can deliver today what those who are suffering today need most — good jobs. And it can deliver the protections from climate change that are needed for the future.\n\nThe Green New Deal will have to be broadened, and this is especially true in countries like the U.S., where many ordinary citizens lack access to good education, adequate health care, or decent housing.\n\nThe grassroots movement behind the Green New Deal offers a ray of hope to the badly battered establishment: they should embrace it, flesh it out, and make it part of the progressive agenda. We need something positive to save us from the ugly wave of populism, nativism, and proto-fascism that is sweeping the world.\n\nThis article was published with permission of Project Syndicate — From Yellow Vests to the Green New Deal.
Shares of retailers suffered broad, and in many cases sharp selloffs Thursday, as a number of downbeat holiday-period sales reports sparked concerns over the health of the sector and consumer.\n\nThe SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund XRT, -2.01% slumped 1.9% in afternoon trade, with 71 of 95 equity components losing ground, to buck the gains seen in the broader market.\n\nMacy's Inc.'s stock M, -3.03% plunged 17.7%, the biggest one-day drop since it went public 27 years ago. The stock was the biggest loser in the sector, and on the New York Stock Exchange, after the department store chain slashed its profit, sales, inventory and gross margin outlook, as holiday sales weakened in mid-December, and didn't pick back up to expected patterns until the week of Christmas.\n\nChief Executive Jeff Gennette said the revised outlook comes as it will take the necessary steps in January to ensure a clean inventory position ahead of fiscal 2019.\n\nThe next biggest decliner was Barnes & Noble Inc.'s stock US:BKS, which plummeted 12.6% after the bookseller said same-store sales rose 4% between Black Friday and New Year's Day, but said it may cut its earnings guidance by as much as 10%, because of increased advertising spending and promotional activity.\n\nSee also: Barnes & Noble's Top20 holiday gift ideas includes only one 1 book.\n\nThe sector's tumble comes after it outperformed the broader market over the past few weeks, as upbeat employment data provided hopes of a strong holiday sales season. The retail ETF (XRT) rallied 15% from the Dec. 21 through Wednesday, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.16% gained 7.0% over the same time. See Economic Report.\n\nThursday's reports throws some cold water on the bullish crowd.\n\nWolfe Research analyst Adrienne Yih said 2018 may have been the peak season for retailers, as an increase in mall traffic was against easy comparisons from a year ago and pent-up demand. And despite relatively clean inventory, there was no evidence of broad-based pricing power.\n\nRetailers were as, if not more, promotional than prior year and 'bought the comp,' Yih wrote in a note to clients, with comp referring to same-store sales growth. Tax reform savings were reinvested in store-related wages and deferred capital spending—both contributing to higher fixed cost infrastructure than before tax reform—adding to greater deleverage risk.\n\nAmong other big decliners, Kohl's Corp. shares KSS, -2.58% shed 6.3%, after the company bumped up its profit outlook, but reported holiday-period same-store sales growth that decelerated to 1.2% from 6.9% a year ago.\n\nThe Buckle Inc.'s stock BKE, -1.77% slumped 7.1%, after the apparel and footwear retailer reported holiday-period same-store sales that fell 0.2%, while net sales for the period declined 6.7%. L Brands Inc. shares dropped 7.1%, after the Victoria's Secret parent reported flat same-store sales for December and a slight decline in net sales.\n\nElsewhere, Target Corp.'s stock TGT, -0.49% shed 3.4%, turning lower ahead of the open as it got caught up in the sector's downdraft, despite reporting accelerating same-store sales growth and affirming its profit outlook. The company said Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith will retire.\n\nSee also: Target will be 'one of the top' holiday performers: Moody's.\n\nAmong other more-active retailer shares, J.C. Penney Co. Inc. US:JCP fell 3.7%, after saying Wednesday it will close more stores, Walmart Inc. WMT, -0.03% slipped 0.4%, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ANF, -0.06% tumbled 9.0%, Gap Inc. GPS, -3.38% declined 3.7% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.33% shed 0.4%.
 'If we have a couple of years of good growth, that could justify the markets where they are. Four percent economic growth this year is possible' \n\nThose were the thoughts of JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, who offered a forecast for U.S. economic growth that outstrips even some of the more bullish economists.\n\nSpeaking during an interview with Fox Business's Maria Bartiromo on Tuesday, Dimon said the recently signed tax legislation, which cuts the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, is likely to support higher levels for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% , the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% , which have already rung up all-time highs in first several sessions of 2018, after a record-setting rally for the equity benchmarks last year.\n\nRead: Dow set to resume record run after taking a breather\n\nDimon said he expects the competitive tax rate to encourage deal-making on Wall Street, pointing to Europe which he said is on pace to grow at a 3% rate. A reading of gross domestic product is slated for Jan. 26.\n\nIn the U.S., the economy grew at a 3.1% annual pace in the second quarter and a 3.2% annual rate in the third, according to the Commerce Department, exceeding the postrecession pace of near 2% A fresh estimate of gross domestic product is slated for Jan. 26.\n\nHowever, few prominent economists are expecting GDP growth to hit a stellar 4% pace this year.\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Glenn Hubbard, Columbia Business School dean, said corporate tax cuts aren't likely to have the stimulative effect many are hoping. It's not going to raise us off to 4% GDP growth, he told the newspaper. But it's not going to kill 10,000 people a year.\n\nMoreover, J.P. Morgan's chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli's forecast for early GDP readings lands below his boss's much loftier expectations, even factoring the tax cuts: We boosted our 1Q18 real GDP forecast from 2.0% to 2.5%…following the recent passage of the tax package. The changes are set to take effect somewhat earlier than we had anticipated a few weeks ago, and also are more frontloaded than we had expected. As a whole, we look for the package to boost GDP growth by about 0.3%-pt in 2018 and 0.2%-pt in 2019, according to his recent research report.\n\nStill, the J.P. Morgan JPM, +1.65% CEO is bullish on the prospects for further economic growth, even as the Federal Reserve officials said they are mindful that tax-cuts and other measures could overheat the U.S. economy and are likely to raise borrowing costs to quell growth.\n\nMeanwhile, Dimon also said he regretted calling bitcoin BTCUSD, +1.00% a fraud, but also said that he believed that blockchain, or distributed-ledger technology behind cryptocurrencies, is real but still thinks that digital assets like the No. 1 digital asset in the world is hyped.\n\nThe issue, he said, is what the governments are gonna feel about bitcoin as it gets really big, and I just have a different opinion than other people. I'm not interested that much in the subject at all.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV it:fca fcau said late Thursday it plans to invest more than $1 billion to modernize a plant in Michigan to make the next generation of its Ram heavy-duty trucks by 2020. The production of the trucks will be relocated to the Michigan factory from a plant in Mexico, Fiat Chrysler said. The move will create 2,500 new jobs, the company said, adding the announcement was made possible in part by the U.S. tax overhaul. The Mexican plant will be repurposed to make future commercial vehicles for the global market, the car maker said. In the same statement, Fiat Chrysler said it will pay a $2,000 bonus to about 60,000 hourly and salaried U.S. employees, excluding senior executives, in the second quarter. American Depositary shares of Fiat Chrysler rose nearly 5% in late trading after ending the regular session up 7.2%.
The U.S. set yet another record for the number of fatalities from the coronavirus-borne illness COVID-19 and recorded the highest number of new cases since the start of the outbreak, with the latest numbers exceeding even the worst case scenario forecasts of health experts.\n\nMore than 4,000 Americans died of COVID-19 on Thursday, according to a New York Times tracker, and at least 280,292 new cases were recorded. In the past week, the country has averaged 237,635 cases a day.\n\nDr. Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had warned in December that the U.S. would suffer more deaths every day for the following two to three months than the almost 3,000 who died in the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, or the 2,400 who died in the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe U.S. continues to lead the world by cases, at 21.7 million, or more than double the next worst tally, India with 10.4 million, and by deaths, at 366,664, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University. With 4% of the world's population, the U.S. accounts for about 20% of reported fatalities.\n\nExperts continued to fret that Wednesday's storming of the Capitol building in Washington D.C. by a mob of Trump supporters has created a superspreader event, as the televised footage showed that many were not wearing face masks.\n\nLawmakers are equally concerned that their confinement in tight conference rooms during the siege has created yet another superspreader event. Rep. Susan Wild, a Pennsylvania Democrat, told CBS that some members of Congress — mostly Republicans, including freshman Republican congressmen — refused to don masks while sheltering in place.\n\nThe news is especially alarming given the new variant of the virus that appeared to originate in the U.K. that is 40% to 70% more infectious than the original virus.\n\nIn the first week of 2021, US states and territories reported more cases of COVID-19 than at any point in the pandemic so far, and the second-highest number of deaths, the COVID Tracking Project wrote in its weekly update on the pandemic.\n\nHoliday data reporting slowdowns from Christmas and New Year's are likely still affecting most metrics — most notably reported tests, which remain well below pre-holiday levels. Hospitalizations, our most stable metric through the holidays, continue to march upward.\n\nThere are more than 132,000 COVID-19 patients in U.S. hospitals, straining systems in California and the South. In Alabama, December's case surge has translated into a higher per capita hospitalization rate than any state saw during the summer's surge, said the update.\n\nAlabama now has the third-highest per capita hospitalizations in the country, trailing only Arizona and Nevada. Staffing shortages in Alabama hospitals, coupled with very low availability of ICU beds, have public health officials in the state bracing for a coming crisis as holiday exposures send more COVID-19 patients to the hospital, said the update.\n\nLos Angeles County is recording a COVID-19 death every 10 minutes and is rationing oxygen and care.\n\nThe U.S. vaccination program continued to stumble also. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine tracker shows that as of 9.00 a.m. ET on Thursday, just 5.9 million Americans had been vaccinated, way below the 20 million that was the most recent revision to targets promised by the federal government. Just 21.4 million doses had been distributed. In December, when the first emergency use authorizations were granted to the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.11% and German partner BioNTech SE BNTX, -1.33% and later by Moderna Inc., the government initially promised 100 million doses would be delivered by year-end.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has left it to states to administer the vaccine program — tweeting that it was up to the states to administer and then calling some states very slow — meaning that stressed state health departments, which have already had to deal with testing, contact tracing, public information campaigns and deciding when or whether schools or businesses should be open or closed, are now tasked with handling the biggest public health effort in decades.\n\nSee:These COVID-19 tax relief measures just got extended\n\nIn other news:\n\n• Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech said an in vitro study found that their COVID-19 vaccine neutralizes the two new highly infectious variants that have emerged in the U.K. and South Africa. The results were published on the preprint service bioRxiv and have not yet been peer-reviewed. Though these two rapidly spreading viruses are different, they share the N501Y mutation, which is located in the receptor binding site of the spike protein and results in the virus's spike protein binding more tightly to its receptor., the companies said in a joint statement. It has been shown to infect mice more efficiently. The trial found the sera of 20 participants in the Phase 3 trials neutralized the virus with the mutation as well as they neutralized the virus without the mutation, said the statement. Pfizer, BioNTech, and UTMB are encouraged by these early, in vitro study findings, said the statement, although further research is needed.\n\nSee also:U.S. could see up to 150,000 more COVID-19 deaths by February as new strain takes hold, expert warns\n\n• The European Medicines Agency said that the product information for BioNTech and Pfizer Inc.'s vaccine should be updated to say there are six doses in each vial. The authorization granted to the vaccine, which is referred to as Comirnaty in Europe, on Dec. 21 in the European Union says there are five doses in each vial. The EMA, which is the E.U.'s drugs regulator, said health care providers should use low dead-volume syringes or needles to extract what it says is an extra dose. The European Commission must next endorse the EMA's recommendation for it to move forward into clinical practice.\n\n• Moderna's MRNA, -5.43% COVID-19 vaccine has been authorized for emergency use by U.K. regulators, bringing a third shot to the country that is battling a surge in coronavirus cases. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, approved the vaccine after a thorough and rigorous assessment by the regulator's teams of scientists, including advice from the independent Commission on Human Medicines, the government said in a statement on Friday. Moderna's vaccine marks the third to be approved for use by the MHRA and the second that uses the mRNA approach, which sends a message to cells telling them to create proteins that can generate an immune response.\n\n• China has placed 11 million people in the northern city of Shijiazhuang into strict lockdown after an outbreak of COVID-19, CNN reported. The city is based in the province of Hebei, which is suffering the worse flare-up in months. A total of 117 cases, including 67 in patients showing no symptoms, have been detected this week. Residents of the city are barred from leaving withy highways blocked, bus and train stations closed and flights canceled.\n\n• The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has declared an emergency in the English capital as it struggles with a wave of new infections that are overwhelming hospitals, the Guardian reported. Khan declared a major incident, in his dual role as mayor and chair of the London Resilience Forum, after discussions with NHS London, local authorities, Public Health England and emergency services in the capital. Covid cases now exceed 1,000 per 100,000 people, he said, forecasting that the city may run out of beds in the next few weeks unless the spread is slowed dramatically. The U.K. has 2.9 million cases and 79,959 deaths, the highest in Europe and fifth highest in the world.\n\nDon't miss:Telemedicine provides people with a lifeline during the pandemic — but once again highlights the divide between rich and poor\n\nStudents Share Lessons From Their Virtual 2020\n\nLatest tallies\n\nThe number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide climbed above 88.4 million on Friday, the Johns Hopkins data show, and the death toll rose above 1.9 million. About 49 million people have recovered from COVID-19.\n\nBrazil has the second highest death toll at 200,498 and is third by cases at 7.9 million.\n\nIndia is second worldwide in cases with 10.4 million, and third in deaths at 150,570.\n\nMexico has the fourth highest death toll at 131,031 and 13th highest case tally at 1.5 million.\n\nChina, where the virus was first discovered late last year, has had 96,489 confirmed cases and 4,788 deaths, according to its official numbers.\n\nSee also: Scotland to impose new lockdown starting at midnight\n\nWhat's the economy saying?\n\nThe U.S. lost jobs in December for the first time in eight months as the coronavirus bore down on the economy again and forced businesses to resort to more layoffs, MarketWatch's Jeffry Bartash reported.\n\nThe government and private sector shed 140,000 jobs last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday.\n\nThe decline in employment was the first since last April, when the U.S. lost a gargantuan 20.8 million jobs in that one month alone.\n\nThe economy is still missing some 10 million jobs that existed before the onset of the pandemic, with little prospect that they'll be recovered any time soon.\n\nIf there was a glimmer of good news in the report, layoffs were concentrated at restaurants and other businesses that rely on large crowds of customers. Many other segments of the economy actually posted strong employment gains last month.\n\nThe official unemployment rate, meanwhile, was unchanged at 6.7%. Yet economists estimate true unemployment is several points higher because the official jobless rate doesn't include about 4 million people who left the labor force last year.\n\nPeople dropping out of the labor force is a big problem, said Thomas Barkin, president of the Federal Reserve.
Dear Moneyologist,\n\nMy brother stole over $336,000 from my parents in the late 1980s. He did this as part of his business as a financial planner/investment consultant. It was part of a $2 million scheme to recover losses after a Black Friday stock market collapse. He was caught and sent to a federal prison camp. He was made to pay restitution. Over the past 20 years he has paid what the judge told him to pay. It is about $100 a month. The way I figure it since the restitution started in 1992 and it is now 2015 that's 23 years at $1200 a year so he has paid $27,600.\n\nMy mother is 98 years old so she is getting near life's end. Her will splits everything equally between her three children. I believe once mother has passed the restitution stops.\n\nTherefore, he will have an outstanding balance of around $300,000, which is about what the remaining estate has in total. Is there any legal way to make him pay the balance, or are we just left to hope his conscience makes him pay? He has done everything by the books on the restitution, but has put all property, business [he owns some franchise restaurants and apartments], cars, etc. in his wife's name to avoid paying more than the minimum restitution. So in this case maybe crime does pay. What are your thoughts?\n\nG.S. in Ohio\n\nDear G.S.,\n\nI can't speak to your specific case, as I don't know the details, but in many cases the restitution does not die with the death of the person whose money was stolen. In that event, the money typically goes to his/her heirs. In this case, that means you and your siblings, assuming your father has passed away. Your brother will not receive a slice of his own restitution as an heir. That said, you're better off talking to your mother's lawyer and/or the prosecuting attorney about what happens to any inheritance he receives.\n\nThe Federal Litigation Unit, a government agency charged with overseeing federal restitution, can garnish a paycheck, seize assets, tax refunds, 401(k), retirement accounts and an inheritance in order to help pay off the full amount owed. But the Justice Department states: Unfortunately, as a practical matter, a defendant who has no money or potential to make money may be unlikely to ever make meaningful restitution to the victims of a crime. That could include keeping assets in a partner's name. But it's not a perfect system.\n\nSometimes, as in your brother's case, the restitution does not fit the crime: $100 is the price most people pay for their cellphone or cable bill, or on a meal at an upscale restaurant. It's a token payment. It doesn't seem fair, and it's not a lot to pay every month, but there are so many loopholes in U.S. law that allow people to avoid paying restitution to victims of crimes. Keeping your home in your spouse's name is certainly one way. Let's not forget that your brother spent time in a federal prison camp too, so his punishment has not all been financial. But, it does not make up for the emotional and financial collateral damage.\n\nRead: What to do when a parent dies and leaves no will\n\nLast year, I interviewed six white collar criminals and, while some were genuinely contrite, some were not in a position to pay off all the money they stole from their companies; they made very small payments to the injured parties every month, and also went on to become part of a speaker bureau, earning a few hundred dollars per speech up to $5,000. One of the half-dozen I spoke with still insisted that his fraud was accidental, which can't be of great (if any) consolation to the victims. (His fraud totaled $4.5 million and he repays $500 a month.) Another white-collar criminal embezzled $13.5 million and had to pay around $7.5 million restitution, and pays $200 a month, based on his reported income.\n\nWhat can you learn from all of this? To accept the terms of your brother's restitution. As one of the people impacted (indirectly, at least) by his crime, you can choose to suffer all these years later, or move on. That's easier said than done, of course. But there are some things you can do in order to make that happen. This might involve a trip to the aforementioned lawyer to put your mind to rest regarding your brother's restitution and your mother's will, speaking to your brother about how you feel his crime has impacted your family, or focusing on making your mother's final years comfortable and happy.\n\nYour brother leads his life the way he chooses, and you have the freedom to do the same with yours.\n\nAlso see: My brother wants me to repay a loan to my late father's estate\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, regifting or any tricky money issues relating to family and friends?

The new year is a popular time for couples to get divorced, as many people want to start the year with a clean slate.\n\nDivorce is never easy, and messy finances and intertwined spousal property and accounts makes it even harder. In their new book, The Optimist's Guide to Divorce: How to Get Through Your Breakup and Create a New Life You Love, (published by Workman Publishing Company) freelance journalist Suzanne Riss and real estate agent Jill Sockwell walk soon-to-be and newly divorced people through the tough aspects of divorce, including managing emotions with serious matters, jump-starting a career and building strong relationships with friends and family. The two also founded the Maplewood Divorce Club, a New Jersey-based divorcees' group.\n\nDon't miss:My wife is divorcing me after 21 years — and wants everything in our savings account\n\nHere's what you can do to ease the pain of divorcehood:\n\nMarketWatch: What are the first potential issues women face when they prepare to get divorced, are in the middle of a divorce, or right after they sign the papers?\n\nSuzanne Riss: It's not just emotionally challenging but there are financial challenges as well. On average, divorce costs $20,000 and that includes legal fees and tax consequences. It is important to go in with your eyes open, whether you're thinking about it or taking steps to file for divorce. We recommend taking a look at your budget, how you're going to earn a living or what expenses you will be incurring. Or maybe you'll be going back to work.\n\nJill Sockwell: If you are separated, and if you're asking a spouse for child support or alimony, you don't have to wait for the divorce to get payments from him. You can ask a lawyer for a consent law order until it is finalized.\n\nMarketWatch: What are some other steps soon-to-be divorcees should take for their money?\n\nRiss: Among the first steps to safeguard your finances is to separate them as soon as possible so you're not responsible for your soon-to-be ex's debt and spending. We also recommend people putting alerts on their accounts, sometimes out of fear or panic one might withdraw a huge amount of money. Get a new cellphone plan. You might need privacy and independence.\n\nYou also need to think about health insurance, especially if you have kids. If you are on a spouse's health insurance plans, you need to decide whether you're going to negotiate to stay on the plan or get new health insurance. Also take a look at if you have enough savings to get you through a couple of months, and if you don't, ask for a loan from a family member or close friend, because there are some unavoidable first expenses when starting out.\n\nSockwell: Make a list of all of the bank accounts, all of the retirement accounts, all of those things that have value because sooner or later your attorney will ask you for those. Budget your monthly expenses. It will help you predict what monthly income you'll need.\n\nIf you are staying in a marital home, can you cover the mortgage? If you have a car, that includes insurance. There's food, transportation to and from work. Kids aren't just clothing but sports and activities. Your settlement agreement should be pretty detailed, including, 'What does child support cover?' so that it is not up for disagreement later on.\n\nMarketWatch: What are some misconceptions of divorce?\n\nSockwell: One misconception is that the court cares if he cheated and you'll get a bigger settlement. It varies state by state. Another: if the divorcee stayed home with kids then they get to continue to be stay-at-home. It is next to impossible to take one income and split it over two houses and maintain the same standard of living. Often times, women out of the workforce will get rehabilitative [short-term] alimony, so they can rejoin the workforce or go back to full-time if they were part-time.\n\nCan Wall Street close this gender gap?\n\nRiss: More women are financially independent and earning an income, so we also heard from a lot of women that they were surprised they were the ones paying alimony to their ex-husbands who either didn't earn as much or worked sporadically, so now there's a rise of women who are paying alimony and seeing their paychecks stretch between two homes instead of one.\n\nSee also:I support a deadbeat husband who refuses to get divorced\n\nMarketWatch: Divorce is emotional — how can women proceed when they also have to deal with finances?\n\nRiss: We encourage women to seek out others who can show them the way because this is a time people isolate themselves because they are embarrassed, confused or may be depressed or anxious. This is a time to make the effort to separate emotional from practical. These decisions can impact you for years to come.\n\nMarketWatch: You mention in your book jump-starting new jobs after divorce — what can they do?\n\nRiss: We had women tell us about careers you can start in six months or less, things you never heard of like phlebotomist, who draws blood from patients for medical tests. They come with a limited number of hours of training and the jobs are plentiful. There are others like medical interpreter and paralegal, or certified nurses' assistant.\n\n(This interview was edited for clarity and space.)
A previous version of this report incorrectly reported what Apple was repatriating and what its payment referred to. This has been corrected.\n\nApple Inc. AAPL, -3.39% shares were up 1.7% Wednesday after the company said it planned to contribute $350 billion to the U.S. economy over the next five years, through new jobs, a new campus, and investments in data centers. In a release issued Wednesday afternoon, the company announced that it would build a second headquarters in a city to be named later on in the year. Apple also said it would add more than 20,000 jobs, on top of its current 84,000. The firm plans to boost its Advanced Manufacturing Fund, which helps domestic manufacturers, from $1 billion to $5 billion. Apple estimated it will have to make a $38 billion tax payment for the deemed repatriation of its overseas profits. A payment of that size would likely be the largest of its kind ever made, the company said in its release. Apple's stock is up 47% over the last 12 months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% is up 31%.
Shares of telecom equipment supplier Ciena Corp. CIEN, -2.93% rose 3.2% in Tuesday morning trading following an upgrade to buy from analysts at Goldman Sachs. We view Ciena as a key beneficiary of a more bullish outlook on US carrier capital expenditures, improving competitive environment, and a lower bar of expectations as investors adjust to an environment of decelerating optical market growth, wrote the analysts, led by Doug Clark. Ciena has heavy exposure to AT&T and Verizon, he wrote. Stein thinks that tax reform and 5G investments could also provide a boost to the stock. Ciena shares have lost 7.5% in the past 12 months, while the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% has gained 23%.
Daniel Packer, a 29-year-old data analyst at an online advertising agency in Los Angeles, knows more responsibilities will stack up as he hits the big 3-0 this summer, so he's been religiously stashing away money in his retirement accounts the last few years.\n\nRetirement is a long ways away for him, he says — at least 30 years — but saving money early on means not worrying about putting away as much later down the road if he weren't able to do so. He's already seeing his strategy pay off, given he has a 1-year-old daughter and raising kids is expensive (try somewhere between $284,000 and $600,000). I'm glad I was able to take advantage of [saving] for the last nine years, he said.\n\nRead: This is how your finances should look in your 20s\n\nRead: This is how your finances should look in your 40s\n\nRead: This is how your finances should look in your 50s\n\nRead: This is how your finances should look in your 60s\n\nThirtieth birthdays are an excellent time to take stock of your future funds, especially as short-term financial obligations solidify, such as continuing to pay off the last of student loans, living on your own (or maybe starting a potentially three-decade stretch of mortgage payments) and raising children. Millennials, the generation 20s to mid-30-year-olds fit into, have delayed marriage and home ownership from happening in their 20s (as was the norm decades ago). Now 57% of today's 30- year-olds are or have been married, 47% are living with a child and a third are homeowners, according to the United States Census Bureau.\n\nSee:How our 'everyone gets a trophy' culture can lead to financial ruin for millennials\n\nHere's all you need to do in your 30s for a great financial future\n\nBy 30, you should have a decent chunk of change saved for your future self, experts say — in fact, ideally your account would look like a year's worth of salary, according to Boston-based investment firm Fidelity Investments, so if you make $50,000 a year, you'd have $50,000 saved already. By 35, you should have twice your salary, the firm said. The median retirement savings for a worker in their 30s was $45,000, according to Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies, which looked at workers' retirement accounts including employer-sponsored accounts and individual retirement accounts.\n\nThe problem? Not everyone is saving — or can save — that much toward retirement. Either they're living paycheck to paycheck, don't know about the accounts available to them or simply aren't thinking about the amount of money they'll need in their futures. Only a third of Americans are saving money in an employer-sponsored or tax-deferred retirement account, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nToday's 30 year olds (and the soon-to-be 30 year olds) are plagued with crippling student debt, which just hit a record $1.31 trillion and affects millennials more than any generation before them. On top of that, some millennials are skipping starter homes altogether for a bigger home and, as nice as that is, home prices are rising as are mortgage rates. Some may also be splurging for a wedding — scary fact: the average American wedding costs about $35,000. The last thing someone in their 30s should do, though, is leave retirement to the wayside.\n\nSee also:How we got to $1 trillion in debt: An illustrated history of student loans in America\n\nIt's important to be saving for retirement while doing all these things at the same time, said Alexander Rupert, assistant portfolio manager at Laurel Tree Advisors in Cleveland, Ohio. Retirement savings should be growth-oriented for someone in their 30s, he said, which means they should be stashing money away whatever they can and considering a high risk tolerance. Market ups and downs will affect the portfolio, but young investors should remember their money (and they) are in it for the long haul, Rupert said.\n\nAnd if you're not investing in an employer-sponsored account (after all, only 14% of employers offer such plans, according to the U.S. Census Bureau) consider a Roth IRA, which more forgivingly allows investors to use those assets for an emergency should a situation arise. As opposed to other accounts, like a 401(k) plan, that place penalties on individuals who withdraw money from these accounts, investors can take money out of a Roth IRA penalty-free so long as they only take out the money they invested, and not the investment earnings of those assets. Some 30 year olds, like Packer, have numerous accounts. Packer and his wife, for instance, have been maxing out their 401(k) plans and Roth IRAs for a few years.\n\nIt will take a load off my shoulders later, Packer said. Setting ourselves up now will pay benefits in the future.\n\nWondering what your savings should look like during a major money milestone?

President-elect Donald Trump said Friday morning that Mexico would pay the U.S. back for a border wall, following reports he may ask Congress for U.S. tax dollars to pay for it.\n\nIn an early-morning tweet, Trump ripped the dishonest media for not reporting that any money spent on building the wall for sake of speed will later be paid back by Mexico.
It wasn't a great week for fourth-quarter earnings, as fewer companies beat expectations than usual, and the outlook for the first quarter fell deeper into the red, which would mark the first year-over-year decline in nearly three years, if it holds.\n\nMeanwhile, the percentage growth in the latest quarter is on track to be double-digits for a fifth-straight quarter, but was still about half the average of the first three quarters of the year.\n\nFactSet publishes a blended growth percentage change for earnings per share for the S&P 500, representing a blend of year-over-year growth of actual results already reported and the average estimates of surveyed analysts of upcoming results.\n\nWith about 90% of the S&P 500 companies having reported results through Friday, the overall blended EPS growth consensus for the S&P 500 held steady on the week at 13.1%. That's still a marked improvement from an estimate of 10.6% growth at the start of earnings season, according to FactSet. See Earnings Watch.\n\nAnd since Dec. 31, the increase in the blended growth estimate has been less than a third of the average increase seen over the last five years, according to FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters.\n\nThe current growth estimate compares with the average reported growth of 25.5% for the first three quarters of the year, and would represent the lowest expected growth since 7.3% in the third quarter of 2017. And for the first time since Q3 2017, the growth isn't expected to be unanimous: The utilities sector is the only one of 11 S&P 500 sectors expected to report an earnings decline.\n\nJonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse, estimated that more than half the earnings growth for the quarter is related to the tax reform implemented last year. The sectors benefiting most form tax reform are consumer discretionary and financials, Golub said.\n\nThe overall expected growth is down from the 16.31% that was expected at the end of the third quarter, as concerns over the negative effects of a strengthening U.S. dollar, rising input costs and worries over a trade the trade war with China have pulled down analyst projections.\n\nThe S&P 500 index SPX, -0.16% tumbled 14% during the fourth quarter, compared with a total 9% gain for the first three quarters of the year. It has advanced 7.5% since earnings season kicked off ahead of the Jan. 14 open, through afternoon trade Friday.\n\nSo far, the beat rate has slightly below historical averages. Butters said this week that 70% of companies reporting results have beat earnings expectations, just below the five-year average beat rate of 71%.\n\nDon't miss: Citigroup kicks off fourth-quarter earnings season with a revenue miss.\n\nWhat might be of more concern to investors, is that the blended EPS estimate for the first quarter continues to worsen, to a decline of 2.9% from a drop of 2.4% last week. That's a stark change from estimates for growth of 1.9% on Jan. 11 and of 6.7% on Sept. 30.\n\nIf the decline holds, if would be the first since the second quarter of 2016, when EPS fell 2.5% to mark a fifth-straight quarter of declines. Through Friday, seven of 11 sectors are now expected to suffer EPS declines, with energy XLE, -2.85% , information technology XLK, +0.75% and XLB, -0.83% expected to show the most weakness.\n\nAlthough its common to see forward EPS estimates fall as a quarter progresses, the cuts for the first quarter have been more pronounced than usual this year. Butters said he during the past 20 quarters, the average decline in the blended EPS estimate during the first month of a quarter has been just 1.6%.\n\nThe following table shows what analysts expected through Friday in terms of year-over-year EPS growth for the S&P 500 and each of the S&P 500's 11 sectors for the fourth and first quarters, as well as the change in estimates since Jan. 11 and Sept. 30.\n\nIndex/sector Blended Q4 EPS growth estimate on Feb. 8 (decline) Blended Q4 EPS growth estimate on Jan. 11 (decline) Blended Q4 EPS growth estimate on Sept. 30 Q1 EPS growth estimate on Feb. 8 (decline) Q1 EPS growth estimate on Jan. 11 (decline) Q1 EPS growth estimate on Sept. 30 S&P 500 13.1% 10.6% 16.2% (2.9%) 1.9% 6.6% Communications services 22.3% 13.7% 16.7% (3.3%) 0.4% 3.0% Consumer discretionary 14.2% 11.2% 16.2% (4.8%) (0.8%) 3.4% Consumer staples 4.6% 2.9% 6.7% (4.0%) 0.8% 2.9% Energy 95.1% 74.8% 91.3% (17.5%) (0.1%) 39.6% Financials 7.7% 10.1% 18.5% (0.9%) 1.9% 3.3% Health care 12.8% 10.8% 11.9% 5.4% 9.1% 8.6% Industrials 18.2% 14.2% 20.6% 3.1% 6.4% 8.9% Information technology 5.1% 3.4% 9.2% (10.0%) (4.2%) 3.5% Materials 4.5% 5.3% 17.5% (9.9)% 7.0% 12.7% Real estate 9.4% 8.5% 9.2% 1.9% 2.5% 5.3% Utilities (4.0%) (6.0%) 5.0% 3.7% 2.8% 4.2% FactSet\n\nRevenue growth is also expected to decelerate, with the FactSet blended growth estimate of 6.6% well below the average of 9.7% for the first three quarters of 2018, and the slowest growth since the third quarter of 2017's 6.2% rise. The fourth-quarter estimate, as well as the first-quarter outlook, has declined slightly over the past week.\n\nThe following table details what analysts expected through Friday in terms of year-over-year revenue growth for the S&P 500 and each of the S&P 500's 11 sectors for the fourth and first quarters, as well as the change in estimates since Sept. 30.
