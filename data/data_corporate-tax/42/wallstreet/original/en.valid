Tesla Motors Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk has increased his investment in the electric-car maker, using more than $50 million of his own money to cover the taxes on shares that cost him less than $7 apiece.\n\nMusk exercised and held 532,000 Tesla TSLA, -4.29% stock options this week, adding to his position in the electric-car maker, which amounted to 21.7% of the company as of August, according to FactSet. According to an SEC filing detailing the transaction, Musk now owns slightly more than 28.9 million shares, which would be worth more than $5.5 billion at Friday's closing price.
The federal government ran a budget deficit of $28 billion in December, the Treasury Department said Thursday, double the shortfall from the same month a year ago as both receipts and spending fell.\n\nTotal receipts were down 9% for the month, with individual income tax collection flat and gross corporate tax collection lower. A decline in Federal Reserve earnings remitted to the Treasury also contributed to the smaller amount of receipts.

Here is the text of Sen. Bernie Sanders' speech on Wall Street and the economy, as prepared for delivery on Tuesday in New York:\n\nThe American people are catching on. They understand that something is profoundly wrong when, in our country today, the top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent and when the 20 richest people own more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans – half of our population. They know that the system is rigged when the average person is working longer hours for lower wages, while 58 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent.\n\nThey also know that a handful of people on Wall Street have extraordinary power over the economic and political life of our country. As most people know, in the 1990s and later, the financial interests spent billions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions to force through Congress the deregulation of Wall Street, the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act and the weakening of consumer protection laws in states.\n\nThey spent this money in order to get the government off their backs and to show the American people what they could do with that new-won freedom. Well, they sure showed the American people. In 2008, the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street nearly destroyed the U.S. and global economy.\n\nMillions of Americans lost their jobs, their homes and their life savings.\n\nWhile Wall Street received the largest taxpayer bailout in the history of the world with no strings attached, the American middle class continues to disappear, poverty is increasing and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider. And Wall Street executives still receive huge compensation packages as if the financial crisis they created never happened.\n\nGreed, fraud, dishonesty and arrogance, these are the words that best describe the reality of Wall Street today.\n\nSo, to those on Wall Street who may be listening today, let me be very clear. Greed is not good. In fact, the greed of Wall Street and corporate America is destroying the fabric of our nation. And, here is a New Year's Resolution that I will keep if elected president. If you do not end your greed, we will end it for you.\n\nWe will no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that has been rigged by Wall Street to benefit the wealthiest Americans in this country at the expense of everyone else.\n\nWhile President Obama deserves credit for improving this economy after the Wall Street crash, the reality is that a lot of unfinished business remains to be done.\n\nOur goal must be to create a financial system and an economy that works for all Americans, not just a handful of billionaires\n\nThat means we have got to end, once and for all, the scheme that is nothing more than a free insurance policy for Wall Street, the policy of too big to fail.\n\nWe need a banking system that is part of the productive economy – making loans at affordable rates to small- and medium-sized businesses so that we create decent-paying jobs. Wall Street cannot continue to be an island unto itself, gambling trillions in risky financial instruments, making huge profits and assured that, if their schemes fail, the taxpayers will be there to bail them out.\n\nIn 2008, the taxpayers of this country bailed out Wall Street because we were told they were too big to fail. Yet, today, 3 out of the 4 largest financial institutions (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo) are nearly 80 percent bigger than before we bailed them out. Incredibly, the six largest banks in this country issue more than two-thirds of all credit cards and more than 35 percent of all mortgages. They control more than 95 percent of all financial derivatives and hold more than 40 percent of all bank deposits. Their assets are equivalent to nearly 60 percent of our GDP. Enough is enough.\n\nIf a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. When it comes to Wall Street reform that must be our bottom line. This is true not just from a risk perspective and the fear of another bailout. It is also true from the reality that a handful of huge financial institutions simply have too much economic and political power over this country.\n\nIf Teddy Roosevelt, the Republican trust-buster, were alive today, he would say break 'em up. And he would be right.\n\nAnd, here's how I will accomplish that.\n\nWithin the first 100 days of my administration, I will require the secretary of the Treasury Department to establish a Too-Big-to Fail list of commercial banks, shadow banks and insurance companies whose failure would pose a catastrophic risk to the United States economy without a taxpayer bailout.\n\nWithin one year, my administration will break these institutions up so that they no longer pose a grave threat to the economy as authorized under Section 121 of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nAnd, I will fight to reinstate a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act to clearly separate commercial banking, investment banking and insurance services. Let's be clear: this legislation, introduced by my colleague Senator Elizabeth Warren, aims at the heart of the shadow banking system.\n\nIn my view, Senator Warren, is right. Dodd-Frank should have broken up Citigroup and other too- big-to-fail banks into pieces. And that's exactly what we need to do. And that's what I commit to do as president.\n\nNow, my opponent, Secretary Clinton says that Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the financial crisis because shadow banks like AIG and Lehman Brothers, not big commercial banks, were the real culprits.\n\nSecretary Clinton is wrong.\n\nShadow banks did gamble recklessly, but where did that money come from? It came from the federally-insured bank deposits of big commercial banks – something that would have been banned under the Glass-Steagall Act.\n\nLet's not forget: President Franklin Roosevelt signed this bill into law precisely to prevent Wall Street speculators from causing another Great Depression. And, it worked for more than five decades until Wall Street watered it down under President Reagan and killed it under President Clinton.\n\nAnd, let's not kid ourselves. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department didn't just bail out shadow banks. As a result of an amendment that I offered to audit the emergency lending activities of the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis, we learned that the Fed provided more than $16 trillion in short-term, low-interest loans to every major financial institution in the country including Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, not to mention large corporations, foreign banks, and foreign central banks throughout the world.\n\nSecretary Clinton says we just need to impose a few more fees and regulations on the financial industry. I disagree.\n\nAs former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has said and I quote: Giant Wall Street banks continue to threaten the wellbeing of millions of Americans, but what to do? Bernie Sanders says break them up and resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act that once separated investment from commercial banking. Hillary Clinton says charge them a bit more and oversee them more carefully … Hillary Clinton's proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle. The only way to contain the Street's excesses is with reforms so big, bold, and public they can't be watered down – busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting Glass-Steagall.\n\nSecretary Reich is right. Real Wall Street reform means breaking up the big banks and re-establishing firewalls that separates risk taking from traditional banking.\n\nMy opponent says that, as a senator, she told bankers to cut it out and end their destructive behavior. But, in my view, establishment politicians are the ones who need to cut it out. The reality is that Congress doesn't regulate Wall Street. Wall Street, its lobbyists and their billions of dollars regulate Congress. We must change that reality, and as president I will.\n\nIt is no secret that millions of Americans have become disillusioned with our political process. They don't vote. They don't believe much of what comes out of Washington. They don't think anyone is there representing their interests. In my view, one of the reasons for that deep disillusionment is the widespread understanding that our criminal justice system is broken and grossly unfair – and that we do not have equal justice under the law. The average American sees kids being arrested and sometimes even jailed for possessing marijuana or other minor crimes. But when it comes to Wall Street executives, some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in this country, whose illegal behavior caused pain and suffering for millions – somehow nothing happens to them. No police record. No jail time. No justice.\n\nWe live in a country today that has an economy that is rigged, a campaign finance system which is corrupt and a criminal justice system which, too often, does not dispense justice.\n\nNot one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the near collapse of our entire economy.\n\nThat will change under my administration. Equal Justice Under Law will not just be words engraved on the entrance of the Supreme Court. It will be the standard that applies to Wall Street and all Americans.\n\nIt seems like almost every few weeks we read about one giant financial institution after another being fined or reaching settlements for their reckless, unfair and deceptive activities.\n\nSome people believe that this is an aberration: that we have an honest financial system in which, every now and then, major financial institutions do something wrong and get caught. In my view, the evidence suggests that would be an incorrect analysis.\n\nThe reality is that fraud is the business model on Wall Street. It is not the exception to the rule. It is the rule. And in a weak regulatory climate the likelihood is that Wall Street gets away with a lot more illegal behavior than we know of.\n\nHow many times have we heard the myth that what Wall Street did may have been wrong but it wasn't illegal?\n\nLet me help shatter that myth today.\n\nSince 2009, major financial institutions in this country have been fined $204 billion. $204 billion. And that takes place in a weak regulatory climate.\n\nHere are just a few examples of when major banks were caught doing illegal activity.\n\nIn August 2014, Bank of America settled a case with the Department of Justice for more than $16 billion on charges that the bank misled investors about the riskiness of mortgage-backed securities it sold in the run-up to the crisis.\n\nIn November of 2013, JP Morgan settled a case for $13 billion with the Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency over charges the bank knowingly sold securities made up of low-quality mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nIn June of 2014, BNP Paribas was sentenced to five years' probation and was ordered to pay $8.9 billion in penalties by a U.S. District Judge in Manhattan after this bank pled guilty to charges of violating sanctions by conducting business in Sudan, Iran and Cuba.\n\nLet me read you a few headlines and you tell me how it makes sense that not one executive was prosecuted for fraud.\n\nCNN Headline, May 20, 2015: 5 big banks pay $5.4 billion for rigging currencies. Those banks include JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup.\n\nHeadline from the International Business Times (February 24, 2015): Big Banks Under Investigation For Allegedly Fixing Precious Metals Prices. The Banks under investigation included Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.\n\nHeadline from The Real News Network (November 26, 2013): Documents in JPMorgan settlement reveal how every large bank in the U.S. has committed mortgage fraud.\n\nHeadline from The Washington Post (March 14, 2014): In lawsuit, FDIC accuses 16 big banks of fraud, conspiracy, which included Bank of America, Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase.\n\nHeadline from the Guardian (April 2, 2011): How a big U.S. bank laundered billions from Mexico's murderous drug gangs. This article talks about how Wachovia (which was acquired by Wells Fargo) aided Mexican drug cartels in transferring billions of dollars in illegal drug money. Here is what the federal prosecutor (Jeffrey Sloman) said about this: Wachovia's blatant disregard for our banking laws gave international cocaine cartels a virtual carte blanche to finance their operations.\n\nYet, the total fine for this offense was less than 2% of the bank's $12.3 billion profit for 2009 and no one went to jail. No one went to jail.\n\nAnd, if that's not bad enough, here's another one.\n\nHeadline: The Wall Street Journal, February 9, 2011: J.P. Morgan Apologizes for Military Foreclosures. Here is a case where JP Morgan Chase, the largest bank in America, wrecked the finances of 4,000 military families in violation of the Civil Service Members Relief Act, yet no one went to jail.\n\nAnd, when I say that the business model of Wall Street is fraud that is not just Bernie Sanders talking. That is what financial executives told the University of Notre Dame in a study on the ethics of the financial services industry last year.\n\nAccording to this study, 51 percent of Wall Street executives making more than $500,000 a year found it likely that their competitors have engaged in unethical or illegal activity in order to gain an edge in the market.\n\nMore than one-third of financial executives have either witnessed or have firsthand knowledge of wrongdoing in the workplace.\n\nNearly one in five financial service professionals believe they must engage in illegal or unethical activity to be successful.\n\nTwenty-five percent of financial executives have signed or been asked to sign a confidentiality agreement that would prohibit reporting illegal or unethical activities to the authorities.\n\nHere's what one banker from Barclays said in 2010, when he was caught trying to price-fix the $5 trillion-per-day currency market: If you ain't cheating, you ain't trying.\n\nHere's what an analyst from Standard & Poors said in 2008, Let's hope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of cards falters.\n\nThis country can no longer afford to tolerate the culture of fraud and corruption on Wall Street.\n\nUnder my administration, Wall Street CEOs will no longer receive a get-out-of jail free card. Big banks will not be too big to fail. Big bankers will not be too big to jail.\n\nAs president, I will nominate and appoint people with a track record of standing up to power, rather than those who have made millions defending Wall Street CEOs. Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks will not be represented in my administration.\n\nAnd, if we are serious about reforming our financial system, we have got to establish a tax on Wall Street speculators. We have got to discourage reckless gambling on Wall Street and encourage productive investments in the job-creating economy.\n\nWe will use the revenue from this tax to make public colleges and universities tuition free. During the financial crisis, the middle class of this country bailed out Wall Street. Now, it's Wall Street's turn to help the middle class.\n\nWe cannot have a safe and sound financial system if we cannot trust the credit agencies to accurately rate financial products. And, the only way we can restore that trust is to make sure credit rating agencies cannot make a profit from Wall Street.\n\nInvestors would not have bought the risky mortgage backed derivatives that led to the Great Recession if credit agencies did not give these worthless financial products triple-A ratings – ratings that they knew were bogus.\n\nAnd, the reason these risky financial schemes were given such favorable ratings is simple. Wall Street paid for them.\n\nUnder my administration, we will turn for-profit credit rating agencies into non-profit institutions, independent from Wall Street. No longer will Wall Street be able to pick and choose which credit agency will rate their products.\n\nIf we are going to create a financial system that works for all Americans, we have got to stop financial institutions from ripping off the American people by charging sky-high interest rates and outrageous fees.\n\nIn my view, it is unacceptable that Americans are paying a $4 or $5 fee each time they go to the ATM.\n\nIt is unacceptable that millions of Americans are paying credit card interest rates of 20 or 30 percent.\n\nThe Bible has a term for this practice. It's called usury. And in The Divine Comedy, Dante reserved a special place in the Seventh Circle of Hell for those who charged people usurious interest rates.\n\nToday, we don't need the hellfire and the pitch forks, we don't need the rivers of boiling blood, but we do need a national usury law.\n\nToday, we need to cap interest rates on credit cards and consumer loans at 15 percent.\n\nIn 1980, Congress passed legislation to require credit unions to cap interest rates on their loans at no more than 15 percent. And, that law has worked well. Unlike big banks, credit unions did not receive a huge bailout from the taxpayers of this country. It is time to extend this cap to every lender in America.\n\nWe must also cap ATM fees at $2.00. People should not have to pay a 10 percent fee for withdrawing $40 of their own money out of an ATM.\n\nBig banks need to stop acting like loan sharks and start acting like responsible lenders.\n\nWe also need to give Americans affordable banking options.\n\nThe reality is that, unbelievably, millions of low-income Americans live in communities where there are no normal banking services. Today, if you live in a low-income community and you need to cash a check or get a loan to pay for a car repair or a medical emergency, where do you go?\n\nYou go to a payday lender who could charge an interest rate of over 300 percent and trap you into a vicious cycle of debt. That is unacceptable.\n\nWe need to stop payday lenders from ripping off millions of Americans. Post offices exist in almost every community in our country. One important way to provide decent banking opportunities for low income communities is to allow the U.S. postal Service to engage in basic banking services, and that's what I will fight for.\n\nFurther, we need to structurally reform the Federal Reserve to make it a more democratic institution responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans, not just the billionaires on Wall Street.\n\nWhen Wall Street was on the verge of collapse, the Federal Reserve acted with a fierce sense of urgency to save the financial system. We need the Fed to act with the same boldness to combat unemployment and low wages.\n\nFurther, we need to structurally reform the Federal Reserve to make it a more democratic institution responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans, not just the billionaires on Wall Street.\n\nIn my view, it is unacceptable that the Federal Reserve has been hijacked by the very bankers it is in charge of regulating. I think the American people would be shocked to learn that Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, served on the board of the New York Fed at the same time that his bank received a $391 billion bailout from the Federal Reserve. That is a clear conflict of interest that I would ban as president. When I am elected, the foxes will no longer be guarding the henhouse at the Fed. Under my administration, banking industry executives will no longer be allowed to serve on the Fed's boards and handpick its members and staff.\n\nFurther, the Fed should stop paying financial institutions interest to keep money out of the economy and parked at the Fed. Incredibly, the excess reserves of financial institutions that are sitting in the Federal Reserve has grown from less than $2 billion in 2008 to $2.4 trillion today. That is absurd.\n\nInstead of paying banks interest on these reserves, the Fed should charge them a fee that could be used to provide affordable loans to small businesses to create hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\nFinally, let me tell you what no other candidate will tell you. No president, not Bernie Sanders or anyone else, can effectively address the economic crises facing the working families of this country alone. The truth is that Wall Street, corporate America, the corporate media and wealthy campaign donors are just too powerful.\n\nWhat this campaign is about is building a political movement which revitalizes American democracy, which brings millions of people together – black and white, Latino, Asian-American, Native American – young and old, men and women, gay and straight, native born and immigrant, people of all religions.\n\nYes. Wall Street has enormous economic and political power. Yes. Wall Street makes huge campaign contributions, they have thousands of lobbyists and they provide very generous speaking fees to those who go before them.\n\nYes. They have an endless supply of money. But we have something they don't have. And that is that when millions of working families stand together, demanding fundamental changes in our financial system, we have the power to bring about that change.\n\nYes, we can make our economy work for all Americans, not just a handful of wealthy speculators. And, now more than ever, that is exactly what we must do.\n\nAnd so my message to you today is straightforward: If elected president, I will rein in Wall Street so they can't crash our economy again.\n\nWill they like me? No. Will they begin to play by the rules if I'm president? You better believe it.\n\nThank you and I look forward to working with the most powerful force in our great nation, not the Barons of Wall Street but the people our government was created to serve.
U.S. Treasury yields jumped on Wednesday after early voting indicated Democrats were on track to win both Senate seats in Georgia and thus control of Congress, an outcome that would give the Biden administration more room to enact his policy agenda.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.660% was at a March high of 1.041%, 8.6 basis points higher than in the previous day. The 2-year note rate TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.125% edged 2.2 basis points up to 0.143%, while the 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.442% climbed 11.4 basis points to 1.819%, more than an eight month high.\n\nWhat's driving Treasurys?\n\nPreliminary voting results show Raphael Warnock won one of two Senate runoffs in Georgia early Wednesday, according to the Associated Press, bringing Democrats a seat closer to a Senate majority.\n\nAlso with 98% of the expected vote total reported, Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff was leading Republican Sen. David Perdue by just 0.4 percentage point.\n\nWith control of the Senate in sight, Democratic lawmakers may now have more scope to pass more aggressive fiscal measures that could weigh on the bond market through increased debt issuance and higher inflation expectations, according to analysts.\n\nIndeed, the 10-year note broke through the key 1% level that has contained the benchmark maturity since March.\n\nRead: U.S. bond market could face 'taper tantrum' risk after Georgia Senate runoffs, says Jefferies\n\nThe Treasury selloff slowed later in the session, however, after violent pro-Trump protesters broke into the U.S. Capitol building, forcing the halt of a joint session of Congress to certify Joe Biden's presidential victory.\n\nIn U.S. economic data, Automatic Data Processing Inc. said private-sector employment fell by 123,000 in December, the first decline in 8 months, after increasing 304,000 in the previous month. Factory orders rose 1% in November.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's minutes from its December policy meeting showed only a small share of its 17 members of its interest-rate setting committee were in favor of expanding purchases of long-term Treasurys last month.\n\nWhat did market participants say?\n\nThe expected increase in spending translates into more back-end supply and higher inflation, hence the steeper curve, said Kevin Walter, co-head of Treasurys trading at Barclays.
As we head into 2017 and consider New Year's resolutions that usually involve dieting, here's an idea that can make you, or someone you care about, a lot of money: Take full advantage of the company 401(k) match. Yes, a lot of money.\n\nIn May 2015, Financial Engines released the results of a study that concluded workers in the U.S. were leaving $24 billion a year on the table because they don't contribute enough to take full advantage of employers' matching 401(k) retirement-plan contributions.\n\nA 401(k) is a tax-deferred retirement plan that allows you to contribute a portion of your salary before taxes. The money is then invested according to your selections and remains tax deferred. The price is that you cannot withdraw any of the money until the year you turn 59 and a half, without paying a penalty. Then, when you are retired and begin withdrawing the money, it will be taxable income, presumably at a lower rate.\n\nDon't miss: Ditch your New Year's resolutions and set three realistic money goals for 2017\n\nBut what can be even more significant is that many employers offer matching contributions, up to a certain percentage of your salary.\n\nHow credit scores predict what you will buy next\n\nLet's say your annual salary is $75,000. Your employer offers, for example, a match of up to 5%. (In my own experience, the lowest employer match I was ever offered was 3%, and the highest was 8%.)\n\nIn this example, if you were to contribute 5% of your salary, or $3,750 a year, to your 401(k) account, your employer would also contribute $3,750 a year. Contributions are typically made every pay period. The bottom line is: Each of your contributions would earn an immediate 100% return — a doubling of your initial investment. You will need to check to see how long it takes for the employer's contribution to be vested. This means you may lose recent matching contributions if you change employers. For some companies, after an initial vesting period, all employer matching contributions are immediately vested.\n\nChances are, especially if your career has decades to go, that your 401(k) money will be invested in stock mutual funds, including low-priced index funds. That instant 100% return provides plenty of downside protection. Yes, it's a tall order to sock away 5% of your gross pay. It may feel as if you took a painful pay cut. But watch your account grow, and you will be amazed.\n\nHow about a New Year's resolution, each year?\n\nDespite that wonderful 100% return if you contribute what your employer is willing to match, you should consider, over time, working your way up to making maximum annual contributions to your 401(k).\n\nThe operative word here is consider. Maxing out your 401(k) contribution isn't for everybody. Your salary might not be high enough. Or you might have another opportunity to invest money outside your 401(k) to make even higher returns. Maybe so, but if you do not contribute to a retirement account, will you really make other investments, or will you simply spend the money on a larger house, a better car or more toys?\n\nThink about it.\n\nThe maximum annual 401(k) contribution is $18,000 a year, and you can contribute an additional $6,000 a year if you are at least 50 years old. Here's more information from the IRS.\n\nThat's a lot of money, especially for our example of a $75,000 salary, for which $18,000 in contributions would amount to 24%.\n\nBut you can start small. Let's say that, in our example, you begin by contributing 5% a year to take full advantage of the match. Over the years, as your salary increases or you get promoted or move on to higher-paying jobs, you might slowly increase your annual contributions. How about increasing it by at least 1% per year? Eventually you will be maxing out your contributions, without feeing too much pain in any one year.\n\nHere's another example, this time with a $100,000 annual salary. You still receive a 5% match for your contributions, but you also max them out at $18,000 a year.\n\nThe employer's 5% match comes to 28% of your annual contribution. That is a wonderful instant return on your investment, and a very high level of downside protection, if the stock market has a bad run.\n\nAnd here's a bit more icing on the cake. Check out this S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% chart:\n\nMarketWatch\n\nAs you can see, the three-year trend is favorable, despite the occasional decline. Decreases may be worrisome, especially if you look at the stock market's results every day. But your 401(k) contributions would continue to be made as long as your employer pays you, so you would have paid lower prices and beaten the market's overall return.

Forgot protectionism — if President-elect Donald Trump wants U.S. car makers to outdo the likes of BMW and Mercedes-Benz, then the American auto industry needs to step it up a gear, a top German minister has said.\n\nSigmar Gabriel, Germany's economy minister, was responding to Trump's warning in an interview that the country's auto makers will have to pay a 35% tax on every car imported into the U.S.\n\nSee:Some fear Trump will knock out economy, as others predict a modest boost\n\nWhen you walk down Fifth Avenue, everybody has a Mercedes-Benz parked in front of his house, Trump said in an interview with The Times of London and German tabloid Bild. How many Chevrolets do you see in Germany? Not many, maybe none, you don't see anything at all over there. It's a one-way street.\n\n 'The American car industry is getting worse, weaker and more expensive ... The U.S. needs to build better cars.'  — Sigmar Gabriel, Germany's economy minister\n\nGabriel — who as vice-chancellor, is seen as deputy to German leader Angela Merkel — responded by saying the U.S. should focus on building more attractive auto models, rather than penalizing competition.\n\nThe American car industry is getting worse, weaker and more expensive, Gabriel told Bild on Monday. If U.S. buyers are choosing German models, as Trump suggests, then that's why the U.S. needs to build better cars, he said.\n\nRead:Trump on the EU: 'Others will leave' the union\n\nTrump has been on a campaign to get U.S. auto makers such as Ford Motor Co. F, -1.58% and General Motors Co. GM, -1.30% to shift manufacturing jobs from foreign plants back to the U.S. Several car makers have scrapped plans for new plants in locations such as Mexico, or said they would consider doing so in response to Trump's threat of high border tariffs.\n\nSee:Every Trump tweet activates thousands of computer algorithms\n\nDaimler AG DAI, +3.51% , the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, and BMW AG BMW, -1.27% are among the German auto companies that have constructed plants in Mexico, with one eye on the U.S. market. Shares of Daimler fell 2% on Monday, while BMW's stock 2.1% lower.\n\nWhile GM's Chevy brand doesn't have a big presence in Germany, the car giant's Opel unit last year said that its market share in Germany was roughly 8%. Mercedes-Benz and BMW each have achieved U.S. market shares of about 2%, according to Statista.

Dear Moneyologist,\n\nI'm planning to divorce my husband of eight years, as he's never worked in this time or contributed to bills. We live in California, a community property state. We live in a house which I bought before the marriage for $700,000, and it's appreciated to $1.2 million. I continue to pay my mortgage on it. I don't have much in savings, just $20,000, and $100,000 in retirement. Is there anything I can do to protect my money? Should I put extra money towards my car or house payments? Should I send money to my parents?\n\nUnlucky in California\n\nDear Unlucky,\n\nYou could do that, but a judge is likely to notice your sudden generous payments towards your mortgage and car loan, and could even penalize you for them. That's the kind of surreptitious action that has gone against others years after the fact. In 1996, a California woman won $1.3 million in the lottery and filed for divorce 11 days later. She didn't tell her husband or anyone else about her windfall, and two years later her husband found out about it (they always do) and sued her. Superior Court Judge Richard Denner ruled that she acted out of fraud or malice and awarded her husband all of her winnings. Had she been honest, they both would have walked away with half.\n\nListen to our new podcast:Money, Markets & More (or subscribe on iTunes): Walking a mile in dead men's shoes and Millennials tap home equity for frivolities.\n\nIn most divorce cases, especially in California which is a community property state, couples are instructed to divide their shared assets down the middle (in monetary terms) and, as part of that settlement, they're allowed to keep what they own personally, such as clothing and jewelry. In your state, you take out of the marriage what you brought into it, but this grows more complicated when a home has appreciated during a marriage and/or when marital assets were used to pay the mortgage (even though, in this case, your husband never actually worked). I'm not against your giving a little money to your parents if they need it for a specific reason, but not to hide it before your divorce is over. If you do have to split those savings, $10,000 is a small price to pay for your freedom. (Interestingly, I told a similar thing to a fellow earlier this week, who learned a $10,000 lesson.) One more consideration: You may need that $10,000 in savings for legal fees.\n\n You could spend your savings, but a judge is likely to see your sudden generous payments to your mortgage and car, and could even penalize you for them. That's the kind of surreptitious action that is likely to go against you in the long run.  — The Moneyologist\n\nWhat's more, the judge is likely to take into account that your husband never worked over this time, or paid the bills, and a good lawyer will make sure that's front and center in your divorce case should your husband's lawyer ask for alimony in lieu of you living in your house (sorry to bring that up). The upside: Alimony is tax-deductible for the payer and must be reported as income by the payee. Divide it all down the middle, start over and look to the future, says Randy Kessler, an Atlanta-based lawyer who wrote the book, Divorce: Protect Yourself, Your Kids, and Your Future. You should feel better that when the case is over, you will still have a job and can replenish so even if it is all divided, you will still be better off than him. It pays to have a good (and honest) divorce lawyer.\n\nThere are so many dirty deals that happen before people file for divorce. I recently heard of a case where a husband took $1 million equity out of the home that he lived in with his wife (his name was on the deed) shortly before they filed for divorce. That's the kind of paper trail that leads all the way back to a disgruntled judge in divorce court. I've had so many letters in recent months from or about people who want to pull a fast one: The wife who wanted to disinherit her stepchildren in the event that her husband of one year dies, and even a psychotherapist who wanted to be in cahoots with his client to cheat the insurance company.\n\nYou've lived honorably up until now and paid your own way and, yes, your husband was a mooch. Leave this marriage with your head held high and don't let him change who you are.\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? Send them to MarketWatch's Moneyologist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nWould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new Moneyologist column has been published?

The recently enacted U.S. tax law restricts federal deductions for state and local taxes (SALT) to $10,000 — including local property and sales taxes as well as local income taxes. While this new restriction will have many implications, it will have a particularly draconian impact on states with large unfunded liabilities for pension benefits and retiree health care, in particular the residents of Illinois, Kentucky, Connecticut, and New Jersey.\n\nUnless states can implement effective ways to circumvent the SALT restriction, they will face much higher political barriers to meeting their unfunded benefit obligations through increased tax revenues. Instead, states will be forced to severely cut spending on public services and/or adopt major reforms of their benefit plans.\n\nA state has payment obligations from three main sources — interest on its outstanding bonds, unfunded liabilities for pension benefits, and unfunded liabilities for health care payments to state retirees (before Medicare at age 65). The interest on outstanding state bonds is relatively easy to estimate; the total outstanding amount of all state bonds was $500 billion in 2016. With the advent of improved accounting rules, it is now possible to compute the unfunded pension and retiree health care liabilities of each state.\n\nThe table below summarizes the situation for each of four states with the highest unfunded liabilities relative to their revenues in 2016 — Illinois, New Jersey, Connecticut and Kentucky. The data in the table come from the Investment Strategy Team at JP Morgan Asset Management.\n\nThe table shows the current obligations ratio for each state — the percentage of its revenues currently devoted to paying down its unfunded pension and retiree health care obligations plus interest on its state bonds. The table then compares that ratio to each state's full accrual obligations ratio. This latter ratio was calculated based on two reasonable assumptions — first, that state should pay down their unfunded pension and retiree health care liabilities over 30 years, and, second, that annual investment returns of states would average 6% over this period.\n\nAs the table shows, the gap between the two ratios could be filled by increases in state tax revenues. To cover the gap, however, states would have to raise local taxes by an eye-watering amount — ranging from 14% in Connecticut to 26% in New Jersey.\n\nThese large increases in state revenues are not feasible, as illustrated by Illinois. To cope with its mammoth unfunded benefit obligations, Illinois has sharply raised tax rates on both individuals and businesses over the past few years. But higher tax rates in Illinois have backfired — driving local residents and firms to other states. In 2015, for example, Illinois lost $4.75 billion in adjusted gross income to other states, according to IRS data.\n\nFinancial instability, debt, and the American Dream\n\nThe new federal restrictions on SALT deductions ring the death knell for this strategy of raising state taxes to meet unfunded benefit obligations. For instance, middle-class residents of these four states are already paying effective tax rates of 9% to 12% — from local income, property and sales taxes. Since Congress has now limited SALT deductions to $10,000, residents of high-tax states are likely to push hard on their elected officials to lower local income and property taxes.\n\nStates could also deal with unfunded benefit obligations by making substantial cuts in non-retirement spending — between 13% and 24% of state revenues according to the table. But local voters will vociferously object to substantial cuts in public services in areas such as education, transportation, and police protection.\n\nThat leaves one more avenue for states to pursue — enacting benefit reforms. According to the table, if the funding gap were closed entirely by increases in worker contributions, that increase would have to be monumental — by at least 400% in each of the four states. Such an increase would not be acceptable to public unions, and further would not be legally permissible in many states because of constitutional protections for accrued pension benefits.\n\nYet there is a light at the end of this tunnel. The U.S. Supreme Court has opined that health care benefits of retirees may be legally modified at the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement – unless expressly guaranteed for life. So the scope of health care benefits and premium sharing by public retirees will become a subject of political negotiation between elected officials and public unions.\n\nReform of public pensions will be much more difficult. Although states may establish a different retirement system for their newly hired employees, this will take years to have much of a financial impact. Already accrued benefits are sacrosanct in most states — with the notable exception of reduced adjustments for costs of living, which have been allowed by many courts.\n\nThe big question: Will courts allow modifications of pension benefits with respect to future years of work by public employees? Historically, California has led the way in blocking such forward-looking pension changes. However, two California courts have recently allowed such changes as long as public employees still receive a substantial and reasonable pension.\n\nIn short, the new federal restriction on SALT deductions will open up a new window on reforming state benefit plans with large unfunded liabilities. As voters absorb the financial implications of the new restriction, they will probably oppose tax increases and service cuts to deal with these liabilities. Instead, they will pressure elected officials to renegotiate benefit plans to the extent legally permissible.\n\nRobert C.

Stocks of movie-theater chains have suffered over the last few months, in part because the box office in 2016 isn't expected to match the record set in 2015, but RBC Capital Markets analyst Leo Kulp said things will look up once the market turns focus to 2017.\n\nIn a note on Tuesday, Kulp said his analysis suggests domestic box-office receipts will fall 4% in 2016 from 2015's $11.12 billion, due to fewer potential megahits — think trying to keep up with Comcast Corp.-owned CMCSA, -1.84% Universal Studio's Jurassic World and Walt Disney Co.'s DIS, -0.50% Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\n\nCheck out:Imax is adding 50% more cinemas in Japan\n\nKulp expects ticket sales to rebound in 2017, hitting $11 billion in revenue as anticipated megahits Star Wars: Episode VIII and Fast 8 are expected to be released, and that's one of the main reasons he holds an overall positive outlook for film exhibitors, as cinemas are called in the industry. Among them, he particularly likes AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC, +4.66% , which operates 4,937 screens located primarily in the U.S. The stock has dropped 22% over the last three months.\n\nWith a potentially stronger 2017 film slate, better exhibitor film rents — the amount theaters pay to studios per ticket sold to screen a movie — and the possibility of mergers and acquisitions throughout the sector, Kulp said AMC's stock is at a level that positions it to outperform its rivals. He upgraded the stock to outperform from sector perform, while lowering his 12-month price target to $27 from $32.\n\nThe stock has underperformed peers due to its limited liquidity and is now trading at a meaningful discount, Kulp wrote. We have a positive outlook on the 2017 box office that we think the market currently isn't focusing on, but will begin to around [the second quarter]. Given the below-peer multiple, we believe AMC has the most upside over the next 12 months.\n\nKulp is among the 15 analysts tracked by FactSet who have the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock; two say hold.\n\nShares of Regal Entertainment Group US:RGC, the nation's largest film exhibitor, are down about 10% over the past three months but have performed better than its peers, leading Kulp to downgrade the stock to sector perform from outperform and knock the price target to $19 from $24.\n\nSee also:Regal Entertainment Group decides against selling company\n\nLooking at others in the industry, Kulp dropped his 12-month price target for Cinemark Holdings Inc. CNK, -0.17% to $36 from $46, maintaining an outperform rating. He said Cinemark's underleveraged balance sheet provides opportunities, with growth in Latin America likely to outperform the domestic market. Cinemark pulls about a quarter of its revenue from Latin America, according to data gathered by FactSet.\n\nHe also cut his Carmike Cinemas Inc. US:CKEC price target to $27 from $32, but also maintained an outperform rating. Carmike, which has about 2,800 screens, generally in midsize communities, has the greatest upside of any other exhibitor from either buying another company or being bought, he said. The theater chain will also likely outperform peers as it institutes a tax-on-top pricing strategy — essentially a stealthy way to increase ticket and concession prices. Rather than an all-inclusive price of, for example, $5 for popcorn, the price would stay the same but no longer include tax. Kulp said AMC benefited from a similar strategy last year.
Treasury yields rose for the first time in six sessions on Monday, as traders returned from a long holiday weekend to the first trading day of 2018.\n\nTreasury prices extended a drop, pushing up yields, after the final reading of the Markit U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 55.1 versus a reading of 53.9 in November and a preliminary December reading of 55.0.\n\nBond trading was closed on Monday for the New Year's Day holiday.\n\nWhat are Treasurys doing?\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.682% rose 5.2 basis points to 2.461% from 2.409% on Friday. The yield is hovering at the same level it was a year ago.\n\nThe 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.402% advanced 6.7 basis point to 2.809% from 2.742% on Friday.\n\nShorter maturities also moved higher, with the 2-year note yield TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.149% up 3.2 basis points to 1.915% from 1.883% on Friday.\n\nBond prices move in the opposite direction of yields.\n\nWhat's driving the market?\n\nWith the economic calendar light on Tuesday, Treasury prices have taken their cue from U.S. equity markets, which began 2018 on a high note. The S&P 500 rose 0.8% to notch fresh record high at 2,695.79 on Tuesday.\n\nYields got a slight boost from better-than-expected manufacturing data. Traders will turn their focus on ISM manufacturing and monthly jobs report later in the week.\n\nThe rebound in yields follows five straight sessions of declines, when optimism about tax reforms that sent the 10-year yield to as high as 2.5% in late December fizzled out by the end of the last year.\n\nLong-dated Treasury yields, which rose during the second half of the last year, remained below their peaks in March, however, largely due to lack of inflation.\n\nWhat are market participants saying?\n\nWe maintain that the most exciting story during 2018 will be about the curve and as we approach the March FOMC meeting and odds of a hike firm, we'll be watching for the risk that the curve inverts more quickly than many expect, wrote Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets.\n\nThe bullish momentum in the Treasury market that commenced last week should prove to be the primary driver of the market in the days ahead and as such we're content to play for a continued bullish flattening of the curve, Lyngen said.\n\nWhich other assets are in focus\n\nEuropean bonds were also mostly higher. The Italian 10-year government bond yield TMBMKIT-10Y, 0.670% continued to climb, jumping 10.8 basis points to 2.097%.\n\nItalian bond yields rose sharply over the past three weeks as antiestablishment parties such as the 5 Star Movement have amassed broad support, according to opinion polls. The rising popularity of these parties raises the chance of a hung parliament, leading political inertia and delaying of reforms for one of the eurozone's economic laggards.\n\nMeanwhile German 10-year bond TMBMKDE-10Y, -0.294% was up 3 basis points to 0.464%.
McDonald's Corp. is a super-sized threat to the competition, with analysts highlighting the potential market-share losses other fast-food chains will suffer as McDonald's initiatives launch throughout the year.\n\nInstinet analysts named the fast-food giant its top U.S. restaurant pick for 2018 citing a number of factors, including the rollout of fresh-never-frozen beef for quarter-pound patties in nearly all of its restaurants by midyear.\n\nWith the test of new Archburgers in seven restaurants, fresh beef could be headed to burgers with different-sized patties as well, analysts say.\n\nThe company's new Dollar Menu, which includes a sausage burrito for $1, a Bacon McDouble at $2, and the Classic Chicken Sandwich for $3 and will be introduced nationwide in the coming days, is also seen as a potential boost to same-store sales.\n\nSee also:Chipotle, Domino's and other restaurant stocks haven't taken into account all the tax reform benefits\n\nHow the 'grocerant' is disrupting the $500 billion food industry\n\nIn addition to the initiatives highlighted in the Instinet note, McDonald's MCD, -0.54% is rolling out a new experience of the future at its restaurants, which includes digital ordering kiosks and table service.\n\nTaken together, Instinet analysts led by Mark Kalinowski think McDonald's is poised to snap up market share, particularly from Subway. Media reports say the sandwich chain is struggling with a 25% traffic decline in the last five years.\n\nSubway, which is privately held, is the third-largest U.S. restaurant chain, with Instinet estimating U.S. sales of $10 billion in 2017. Instinet thinks hundreds of Subway franchisees are in financial trouble, and would not be surprised to see hundreds of closures during 2018. Subway currently has more than 25,800 stores domestically, analysts say.\n\nRead:Chipotle's search for a new CEO may help it 'rediscover the magic,' says analyst\n\nSubway is clearly troubled, and this continues to represent a market-share opportunity for other quick-service concepts in the U.S. — including McDonald's, and arguable perhaps even to a greater degree than any other single quick-service concept, Kalinowski wrote.\n\nInstinet rates McDonald's shares buy and raised its price target to $190 from $180.\n\nAnalysts at BTIG also raised their McDonald's price target, to $200 from $175, based on some of the same efforts as those emphasized at Instinet, including the new Dollar Menu and mobile ordering and delivery.\n\nAfter several years of playing defense, we believe McDonald's is finally returning to an offensive strategy which will yield stronger comp growth and increased market share, wrote analysts led by Peter Saleh.\n\nThe Dollar Menu should help the company regain some of the 500 million transactions it has lost, adding a potential 125-to -175 basis points to same-store sales annually over the next several years, he added\n\nBTIG rates McDonald's shares a buy.\n\nDon't miss:Mobile orders are creating headaches for restaurant chains\n\nOne of the companies that Saleh thinks will suffer as a result of the McDonald's upswing is Jack in the Box JACK, -0.79% , which the team downgraded to neutral from buy.\n\nOur view of the strength of McDonald's initiatives around value, digital and food quality… leads to a dimmer view of competing concepts which we expect will be market share donors, Saleh wrote in a separate note. We recognize there are still positives to the Jack in the Box story including the finalized sale of Qdoba, refranchising and tax reform benefit, but the weaker sales outlook leads to a more balanced view of the shares and we are downgrading accordingly.
You don't always get what you pay for. But you don't often get much more.\n\nThis twist on an old saw serves as a good reminder for self-directed investors hunting online for stock ideas. That's because we're deep into a substance light era of online content, dominated by vapid Twitter rants, pesky blogs offering puff posts and a hollowed-out financial press corps.\n\nSure, sell-side analysts on Wall Street still write substantial research, which sometimes appears online. But you have to take it with a grain of salt. Under the same roof there's typically a division looking to do investment banking for the same companies that the analysts cover. Are the analysts really impartial?\n\nAll of this highlights the value of the humble stock newsletter writer — those scribes who charge a fee for what can often be high-quality, independent stock research.\n\nSure, I have a bias, because I write one of them: Brush Up on Stocks.\n\nBut quantitative analysis has shown that newsletter writers can be a profitable source of stock ideas. For years, financial columnist Mark Hulbert has painstakingly tracked dozens of newsletter writers. He's found many performed consistently well.\n\nHulbert tracks newsletter performance at Hulbert Ratings. I've followed his work for over 15 years to find the best stock letter writers for an annual roundup of their market outlook and favorite stocks. Several letter writers regularly hit the top of his rankings.\n\nHere are five newsletter writers and their two favorite picks for 2018, bringing the total to 10 stocks.\n\nGeorge Putnam, The Turnaround Letter\n\nAs the name suggests, Putnam is a deep-value investor looking for troubled companies that can right the ship.\n\nMarket outlook: Unsurprisingly, given his penchant for value, Putnam thinks the market looks pretty rich. He's also troubled by elevated investor sentiment.\n\nGiven that a lot of people have a rosy outlook, any surprises are likely to be negative, he says.\n\nOne problem is that investors in popular exchange traded funds (ETFs) and index funds haven't really researched the underlying stocks they hold. So they may lack the conviction to stick with them when the going gets rough. That could compound the selling.\n\nExchange traded funds and index funds have been spiraling up. If there is a stumble, they could spiral down just as rapidly, cautions Putnam.\n\nFavorite stocks: Shares of General Electric Co. GE, -2.65% have declined over 42% in the past 12 months to levels not seen since the late 1990s. Chalk it up to a string of disappointing quarters and a dividend cut. But the venerable industrial giant is not down for the count.\n\nUnder new CEO John Flannery, GE will hunker down in three core areas: aviation, health care and power. These are all sectors where GE has a strong position. Flannery plans to sell non-core assets, and focus on cost cutting to boost cash flow.\n\nI think they are doing all the right things, says Putnam. They have good franchises in the businesses they are going to stay in.\n\nNext, Putnam singles out the turnaround Weatherford International Ltd. US:WFT in oilfield services. Under prior management, Weatherford branched out into too many businesses, and took on too much debt to do so. That didn't work out so well. The stock now trades near an eight-year low. Under the new leadership of Haliburton Co. HAL, -5.05% veteran Mark McCollum, Weatherford is unloading non-core assets and paying down debt.\n\nThere is a lot of inefficiency to be shaken out, says Putnam.\n\nWeatherford's stock could produce big gains. Just remember, turnarounds require time — and patience.\n\nAlso see:Oilfield-services stocks are about to stage a big rebound, Credit Suisse says\n\nJohn Buckingham, The Prudent Speculator\n\nBuckingham invests in what he thinks are undervalued stocks with solid potential, both via managed accounts and his mutual fund, the Al Frank Fund VALUX, -0.95% .\n\nMarket outlook: Buckingham is an eternal optimist. But this year he's expecting no more than typical market returns of around 9%-10% for the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% , driven by continued economic strength, earnings growth and benefits from tax reform. He thinks value stocks will outperform this year, after a long spell of lagging growth stocks.\n\nFavorite stocks: Buckingham dislikes singling out favorites because he thinks diversification is crucial. But he plays along. One favorite is Walt Disney Co. DIS, -1.52% . Buckingham thinks the shares have been beaten down too far by investors overly worried about weakness in its ESPN division, and competition from Netflix Inc. NFLX, -3.75% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -3.44% .\n\nAfter all, Disney has great content, too, says Buckingham. And it's bulking up with a planned purchase of the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox Inc. FOX, -0.12% .\n\nThey have history of making good acquisitions, he says, citing the purchases of Pixar Animation Studios and Lucasfilm. They have unparalleled content, and an unrivaled machine to monetize that content.\n\nBuckingham also likes the pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. MRK, -0.04% , whose stock has been hit by concerns about the prospects for cancer drug Keytruda, and upcoming competition as drugs roll off patent. Those worries have knocked Merck shares down to attractive levels. It trades for around 14 times forward earnings, compared with a 10-year average price-to-earnings multiple of 19.\n\nThat is too low, says Buckingham. This is one of the highest-quality pharmaceutical companies out there. He cites its strong pipeline of drug candidates and solid financial strength.\n\nKelley Wright, Investment Quality Trends\n\nWright favors high-quality companies, based on factors that include financial strength, and consistent dividend and earnings growth. Then he suggests them when they appear to be at relatively low valuations because their dividend yields are near historical highs. (When stocks decline, their dividend yields rise, barring dividend cuts.)\n\nMarket outlook: Wright thinks the S&P 500 could advance 8% to 10% in 2018, as long as the Federal Reserve doesn't hike interest rates and proceed with quantitative tightening too quickly.\n\nFavorite stocks: Plans in Washington, D.C., to increase spending on infrastructure have been overshadowed by tax reform. But Wright thinks infrastructure could be a big deal, especially for companies that will benefit. Two of them happen to look relatively cheap right now, because their dividend yields are not too far from historical highs.\n\nOne is Fluor Corp. FLR, -3.15% , in engineering and construction. Nobody can do big construction projects like Fluor, says Wright.\n\nNext, he likes Cummins Inc. CMI, -0.51% , which makes engines used in heavy construction equipment like earth movers.\n\nRichard Greifner, Motley Fool Inside Value\n\nGreifner looks for well-run companies whose shares are trading at attractive levels, to hold for the long term.\n\nMarket outlook: A core tenet at Motley Fool is that it's impossible to make market calls. So Greifner has none for 2018. If you have a long-term perspective with stocks, then the near-term market outlook doesn't really matter, says Greifner.\n\nFavorite stocks: Greifner singles out MRC Global Inc. MRC, -4.45% , a huge distributor of equipment used in energy production and industry, like pipes, valves and fitting products. The company has been cutting costs, paying down debt and repurchasing shares. Meanwhile, its customers are increasing their spending because of strength in energy and the economy. Greifner also likes Michaels Cos. MIK, -0.23% , a large arts-and-crafts retail chain. Unlike a lot of retailers, Michaels isn't beaten down by worries about competition from Amazon. But this makes sense, says Greifner, because customers like to see and touch crafts products before they buy them, to make sure they are right for the task at hand.\n\nMichael Brush, Brush Up on Stocks\n\nI watch insiders closely to look for the right kinds of buying patterns, according to a system I've developed over the years. Then from among those names, I favor companies with financial strength that look relatively cheap, as long as there's a plausible reason why business will improve. As a contrarian, I especially like stocks where insiders are challenging consensus negativity toward their companies either by investors or sell-side analysts. Unlike the letters above, I've never been ranked by Hulbert.\n\nMarket outlook: Investor sentiment is running high, a potential negative. But stocks overall still look reasonably valued given how low interest rates are. A selloff is possible at any time, given investor exuberance. But a recession is not on the horizon, so any significant weakness should present a buying opportunity.\n\nFavorite stocks: My favorite company and largest personal holding at the moment is Tellurian Inc. TELL, -7.25% , an undiscovered company that will become a big player in liquid natural gas (LNG) exports over the next few years. How do I know this? I don't, for sure. But it's a reasonably safe bet given that CEO and founder Charif Souki and his management team are responsible for creating 25% of the LNG export capacity around the globe.\n\nSouki founded Cheniere Energy LNG, -3.56% , a big company in the space. But he got edged out by investor Carl Icahn in a disagreement on how to use cash flow. Souki left and founded Tellurian, where he's developing an LNG export project he presumably would have launched inside Cheniere.\n\nI also recently suggested Lending Club Corp. LC, -0.85% , in part because of the huge buying by Chinese technology and internet expert Tianqiao Chen, who founded the online gaming company Shanda Interactive Entertainment years ago while he was in his 20s.\n\nHe owns around 20% of Lending Club, an online peer-to-peer lending platform. LendingClub recently tightened its lending standards, which hurt loan growth, so the company missed earnings estimates and guided down. But it still expects 15%-20% annual revenue growth over the next few years. This seems plausible given how many people with OK credit would like to refinance their credit card debt with loans. Lending Club estimates $300 billion to $350 billion in credit card debt could potentially be refinanced in this way.\n\nAt the time of publication, Michael Brush held TELL.

Fear is on the rise. Wall Street's most popular measure of uncertainty and anxiety in the stock market, the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +12.22% , climbed more than 11% Thursday, marking its sharpest daily rise since Nov. 3, 2016, according to FactSet data. The spike comes as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% , the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% have staged their worst declines in weeks. The Dow, for example, is on track for its steepest daily drop since October. The pullback comes as investors rethink a rally in the equity market that has been supported by a raft of policy proposals by President-elect Donald Trump, which include looser regulations on Wall Street, tax cuts and an increase in fiscal spending-- all factors that are expected to boost U.S. economic growth. However, a lack of details on his legislative agenda at Trump's news conference on Wednesday may have raised concerns about his ability to make good on his promises. The VIX is used as a way for investors to bet declines in the S&P 500, and its levels of late have suggested that traders haven't been wary of a big drop in stocks, which means a sudden tumble in equities could catch investors flat-footed. Still, current levels of the VIX at about 12.54 may not immediately raise red flags because readings of about 20 are seen as the clearest indication that fear is taking hold in the market. On Wednesday, the VIX also tipped higher on the heels of Trump's conference.
How close was the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday to hitting an eagerly awaited milestone? Less than six pennies. That is essentially the difference between oh-so-close and maybe-next-session for the blue-chip gauge's frustrating march to 20,000.\n\nThe Dow DJIA, -0.46% on Friday reached a high of 19,999.63, or about .37 point from achieving history—at least in psychological terms. In other words, a 5.5 cent move in any one of the price-weighted Dow's components would have tipped it over the edge, based on the Dow divisor of 0.14602128.
Q.: Dan. I have two daughters, 21 and 23, and their mom (my ex- wife) died March 2020. My daughters inherited 401(k) money as their mom was currently employed and they inherited IRA money too. I read an article you wrote concerning turning an inherited 401(k) funds into a Roth. I'm unsure of the process and can't really find any literature pertaining to the topic. Might you be able to help? Thanks, Jay\n\nA.: I'm so sorry for your family's loss, Jay. A few thoughts come to mind.\n\nIf the 401(k) was funded with pretax contributions, any amount converted will be taxable to them but converting to Roth could be a good move because at 21 and 23, they are likely in a low tax bracket. If they convert, invest prudently, and leave the funds alone, in 2030 they could get a good chunk of money tax-free at a time when they may be in a higher tax bracket.\n\nInherited IRA money cannot be converted to Roth IRAs, but it is allowable under the law to convert inherited 401(k) assets directly into Inherited Roth IRA accounts. The girls would each set up an Inherited Roth IRA account. Then they instruct the 401(k) to send their shares directly to their Inherited Roth IRA accounts. The checks should be made payable to the Inherited Roth IRA not your daughters as individuals. If they get a check individually, it is considered a distribution not eligible for rollover.\n\nThe amount converted is taxable income to the girls in the year of the conversion but once that is done, they can get any of those converted funds out tax-free at any time. The normal 5-year rule for conversions does not apply because the distribution from the 401(k) is due to the death of the participant.\n\nIf they do not withdraw all the amount converted before the fifth tax year after the conversion, they will then be able to get earnings out tax-free, too. Because their mother died after 2019, they could choose to leave the money alone and let it grow tax-free until 2030. At the end of that year, they must empty the account, but all the money received will be tax-free.\n\nOne complication for your daughters if they are still in school is the effect these funds may have on their financial aid. Generally, inherited retirement accounts are not counted as assets on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). However, income from such accounts, including income from a conversion can count. Even distributions from an Inherited Roth IRA that are not taxable can be counted as income for student aid purposes. If they are receiving financial aid, they should consult with an adviser to assess all the tradeoffs. They may want to delay taking any funds from the inherited accounts or converting.\n\nIf you have a question for Dan, please email him with 'MarketWatch Q&A' on the subject line.\n\nDan Moisand is a financial planner at Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo in Orlando, Melbourne, and Tampa Florida.

The Dow and S&P 500 on Monday booked their sharpest daily drop in almost 10 weeks, with investors facing concerns around the potential for borrowing costs to rise, the spread of COVID-19 and the slow pace of the vaccine rollout.\n\nTo end 2020, the markets finished at or near records: The Dow added 1.4% in the final week of the year, 3.3% in December, 10.2% in the fourth quarter and 7.3% on the year. The S&P 500 rose 1.4% for the week, 3.7% in December, 11.7% in the fourth quarter and gained 16.3% for the year.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index saw its best annual return since 2009, rising 43.6% in 2020, aided by a 0.7% rise in the final week of 2020, a 5.7% in December, and a 15.7% in the final three months of last year.\n\nWhat drove the market?\n\nStocks buckled under selling pressure as investors worried about the potential for U.S. rates to move higher as the American economy looks to recover from the pandemic.\n\nWhat I think is taking place is the 10-year Treasury break-even rate has exceeded 2% for the first time in more than two years, said Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist, Capitol Securities Management, pointing to the closely watched gauge of what holders of Treasury inflation-protected securities anticipate inflation will average over the next decade.\n\nEvery selloff since 2009, except for March, has been because of higher rates, Engelke said, adding that Monday's climb in inflation expectations is being driven by the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, massive amounts of stimulus from the federal government and the potential for more spending from a Biden administration.\n\nIn other words, good news might be bad.\n\nBut on Monday, Chicago Federal Resere President Charles Evans said it likely will take years to get average inflation up to 2%, which means monetary policy will be accommodative for a long time, in a speech at the annual meeting of the American Economics Association. Evans said that Fed officials shouldn't settle for just getting inflation slightly above 2% if it wanted to achieve its 2% average inflation target.\n\nThis comes as the global tally for confirmed cases of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 rose above 85 million on Monday, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, while the death toll rose above 1.8 million. Some experts warned that the COVID data could be undercounted because staffing at many centers is reduced.\n\nThe rapid spread of a variant of the deadly pathogen that was first reported in Britain prompted the UK prime minister on Monday to order a new national lockdown until at least mid-February. Also raising anxieties are new aggressive variants reported in South Africa, New York, Colorado and California, where Gov. Gavin Newsome has extended regional stay-at-home orders remain in place as the vaccination effort continues.\n\nThe parabolic rise in new cases seems to be leveling off, a sign that perhaps the fall surge is running its course. But the economic impact will remain for a few more months at least, said James Meyer, chief investment officer at Tower Bridge Advisors.\n\nStill, Meyer also expects markets to look past the pandemic's toll and focus on the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, which has come under scrutiny as the pace of the rollout has fallen short of earlier forecasts.\n\nU.S. vaccine czar Moncef Slaoui on Sunday said that the U.S. could increase its vaccine rollout by giving out half doses of the medication developed by Moderna MRNA, -5.43% . The biotechnology company on Monday said it was ramping up production of its COVID-19 vaccine for distribution in the U.S. and globally.\n\nWall Street also has been keeping an eye on Georgia's as runoff elections on Tuesday in which two U.S. Senate seats have the potential to inject fresh volatility into markets, particularly if the outcome sparks political turbulence in Washington around recent fiscal spending measures and easy-money policies out of the Federal Reserve.\n\nSome market participants say any complacency about the runoff among investors might be misplaced, namely if Democrats win both Senate seats and help President-elect Joe Biden reverse the corporate tax cuts of 2017, which could put company earnings and stock prices under some pressure.\n\nRead: Why the Georgia runoff elections for the U.S. Senate could turn into a 'big deal' for markets\n\nAnticipating the policy agenda of the incoming Biden administration is a key focus for investors in the new year, Jason Pride, chief investment officer, private wealth at Glenmede wrote in a team strategy note Monday. If the GOP wins just one seat, they will likely stonewall some of Biden's more ambitious proposals, but a Democratic sweep of both elections might give the incoming administration free rein on their policy agenda.\n\nCheck out: U.S. political polarization presents biggest 'risk' to the world in 2021: Eurasia Group\n\nInvestors saw fresh manufacturing sector data in Asia and Europe that was better than expected, reflecting improvement from the stultifying levels of economic expansion prevalent during the pandemic, according to surveys of purchasing managers for December.\n\nIn U.S. economic data, the final IHS Markit manufacturing survey for December was upgraded to a reading of 57.1, compared with an initial reading of 56.5. Construction spending rose 0.9% in November.\n\nWhich stocks were in focus?\n\nElectric car-battery developer QuantumScape Corp. QS, +5.00% plunged 40.8%, the most ever, on Monday, a day that saw stocks of EV makers soaring on sales news.\n\nShares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, +3.68% ended shy of a new $700 billion market cap milestone, after trading above that level earlier Monday, with the stock price needing to close at or above $738.474, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nBrookfield Property BPY, +1.29% shares rose 17.6% after parent company Brookfield Asset Management offered $5.9 billion to buy out public shareholders in the entity for $16.50 per unit. Brookfield is a large, global holder of office properties and shopping malls.\n\nTeledyne Technologies Inc. TDY, +0.32% plans to acquire Flir Systems Inc. FLIR, +0.09% in a cash-and-stock deal valued at about $8 billion. Teledyne was down 7.7%.\n\nHealth care insurer Centene Corp. CNC, -1.72% said Monday it has agreed to acquire Magellan Health Inc. MGLN, -0.19% for $95 a share, in a deal with an enterprise value of $2.2 billion. Centene Corp. shares advanced 3.4%.\n\nDentsply Sirona Inc. XRAY, +0.21% shares gained 2.7% after it announced its acquisition of Byte, a privately owned clear dental-aligner provider, in an all-cash deal valued at $1.04 billion.\n\nShares of U.K. gaming company Entain ENT, -0.20% jumped 17.6% after rejecting the proposed 1,383 pence per share bid from MGM Resorts MGM, +3.31% that valued the company at £8.09 billion.\n\nWhich assets were on the move?\n\nThe 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.659% was 0.2 basis point higher at 0.915%. Bond prices move in the opposite direction of yields.\n\nFebruary U.S. benchmark crude futures CL.1, -0.50% closed down nearly 1.9% at $47.62 a barrel, while gold GCG21 settled 2.7% higher at $1,946.60 an ounce.\n\nThe dollar was mostly flat against its major rivals, based on the ICE U.S. Dollar Index. DXY, +0.05%\n\nThe pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index FXXP00, +0.19% closed up 0.7%, and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 UKX, -0.60% climbed 1.7%. The Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +0.53% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index HSI, +1.35% both close 0.9% higher, while Korea's Kospi 180721, +0.78% surged 2.5%.\n\nMark DeCambre contributed reporting
Chinese passenger-vehicle sales fell last year for the first time since 1990 as economic uncertainty weighed on consumers, producing a wreck for Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co. and other manufacturers.\n\nThe slump, shown in official data Monday, ended the growth that many foreign and domestic auto makers had expected to last for years to come. Facing saturation elsewhere, global auto makers have banked on China, the world's largest car market.
Who says you have to be an energy drink to advertise like one?\n\nCanada Dry, part of the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group Inc. portfolio of brands, is making a push with the sporting crowd as the popularity of energy drinks grows among consumers. But it's not actually launching a new energy drink.\n\nThe ginger ale brand has previously pushed a message about relaxation in ads focused on the drink's ginger-farm roots. It's now turning to scenes from the gym for its latest spots, which will debut Monday on ESPN and NBC Sports. But the ads still hang on to their relaxation theme.\n\nConsumers are increasingly turning away from traditional carbonated drinks and toward beverages like energy drinks. Cowen & Company analysts suggested last month that Coca Cola Co. KO, -1.31% acquire the remaining stake in Monster Beverage Corp. MNST, -0.77% in order to take full advantage of this trend.\n\nWhile consumers are clearly showing increased concern over sugar consumption, the consumer has not rejected sugary beverages outright as we consistently see outsized growth for sugar beverage categories that also offer consumers a functional benefit to help justify that sugary beverage occasion, analysts wrote in a note.\n\nRead also:It's time to sell Coke and P&G stocks, Goldman says\n\nThe new ad also comes on the heels of an upgrade of Dr. Pepper Snapple US:DPS by Goldman Sachs.\n\nWhile in general we do not favor large companies buying into growth, we believe the recently announced acquisition of Bai, should it close on announced terms, is a strategic fit that could bolster Dr. Pepper Snapple's sales growth and de-risk a potential distribution loss that could occur if Bai is sold to another company, the Monday note said.\n\nBai is a line of antioxidant beverages made with smart sweeteners like those from the Stevia leaf.\n\nAnalysts also believe that Dr. Pepper Snapple is well-positioned if tax policies change.\n\n[I]n the even broader tax policy changes occur as currently proposed, Dr. Pepper Snapple would be a relative beneficiary given its current high tax rate (35%), limited mismatch from a destination-based tax perspective, and low likelihood of sizeable incremental debt post the announced Bai acquisition, the note said.
WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Joe Biden has selected Merrick Garland, a federal appeals court judge who in 2016 was snubbed by Republicans for a seat on the Supreme Court, as his attorney general, two people familiar with the selection process said Wednesday.\n\nBiden is expected to announce Garland's appointment on Thursday, along with other senior leaders of the department, including former homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco as deputy attorney general and former Justice Department civil rights chief Vanita Gupta as associate attorney general.\n\nIn picking Garland, Biden is turning to an experienced judge who held senior positions at the Justice Department decades ago, including as a supervisor of the prosecution of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.\n\nThe pick will force Senate Republicans to contend with the nomination of someone they spurned in 2016 — refusing even to hold hearings when a Supreme Court vacancy arose — but Biden may be banking on Garland's credentials and reputation for moderation to ensure confirmation.\n\nSee also: Warnock projected winner, while Ossoff clings to slim lead in second Georgia race\n\nGarland was selected over other finalists including Alabama Sen. Doug Jones and former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates. The people familiar with the process spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nIf confirmed, Garland would confront immediate challenges, including an ongoing criminal tax investigation into Biden's son, Hunter, as well as calls from many Democrats to pursue inquiries into Trump after he leaves office. A special counsel investigation into the origins of the Russia probe also remains open, forcing a new attorney general to decide how to handle it and what to make public.\n\nGarland would also inherit a Justice Department that has endured a tumultuous four years and would likely need to focus on not only civil rights issues and an overhaul of national policing policies after months of mass protests over the deaths of Black Americans at the hand of law enforcement.\n\nIt was unclear how Garland's selection would be received by Black and Latino advocates who had advocated for a Black attorney general or for someone with a background in civil rights causes and criminal justice reform.\n\nSee also: Big Tech Stocks Are Falling. Why the Possibility of a Blue Wave Raises Risks.\n\nGarland would also return to a Justice Department radically different than the one he left. The Sept. 11 attacks was years away, the department's national security division had not yet been created and a proliferation of aggressive cyber and counterintelligence threats from foreign adversaries have made counties like China, Russia and North Korea top priorities for federal law enforcement.\n\nBut some of the issues from Garland's first stint at the department persist. Tensions between police and minorities, an issue that flared following the 1992 beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles, remain an urgent concern particularly following a summer of racial unrest that roiled American cities after the May killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nAnd the FBI has confronted a surge in violent from anti-government and racially motivated extremists. That is a familiar threat to Garland, who as a senior Justice Department official in 1995 helped manage the federal government's response to the bombing of a government building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people. The bomber, Timothy McVeigh, who was later executed.\n\nGarland has called the work the most important thing I have done and was known for keeping a framed photo of Oklahoma City's Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in his courthouse office in Washington.\n\nAt the time of the bombing, Garland was 42 and principal associate deputy attorney general, a top lieutenant to Attorney General Janet Reno. He was chosen to go to Oklahoma City, the highest-ranking Justice Department official there, and led the prosecution for a month until a permanent lead prosecutor was named.\n\nGarland was selected over other contenders for the job including former Alabama senator Doug Jones, who lost his Senate seat last month, and former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates.\n\nIt is rare but not unprecedented for attorneys general to have previously served as judges. It happened in 2007 when President George W. Bush picked Michael Mukasey, a former federal judge in Manhattan, for the job. Eric Holder, President Barack Obama's first attorney general, had also previously been a Superior Court judge.\n\nGarland was put forward by former President Barack Obama for a seat on the Supreme Court in 2016 following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, but Republicans refused to hold hearings in the final year of Obama's term. The vacancy was later filled by Justice Neil Gorsuch during the Trump administration.\n\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to let the nomination move forward in the Senate in the final months of Obama's tenure. He was criticized by Democrats this fall when he took the opposite approach toward confirming President Donald Trump's Supreme Court pick, Amy Coney Barrett. He said the difference this time around was that the White House and Senate were controlled by the same political parties.\n\nOne year later, after the firing of FBI Director James Comey, McConnell actually floated Garland's name as a replacement for that position, though Garland was said to be not interested.\n\nGarland has been on the federal appeals court in Washington since 1997. Before that, he had worked in private practice, as well as a federal prosecutor, a senior official in the Justice Department's criminal division and as the principle associate deputy attorney general.
Dear Moneyist,\n\nI have a question about the stimulus checks. I happened to have inherited my mother's house, so if I don't qualify, that's fine. I'm working. I have a coworker who works massive amounts of overtime, and owns 10 homes, nine of which are rented. How did he get a stimulus check?\n\nCurious Colleague\n\nThe Moneyist:My mother gave me a substantial financial gift. I gave it back. My soon-to-be ex-husband says half belongs to him\n\nDear Colleague,\n\nIf you don't need a stimulus check, and you don't qualify, leave it at that. You will drive yourself crazy peeking over the office silo wondering why somebody else got one, trying to size up their socioeconomic status like RoboCop. Today, it will be the colleague with 10 homes who is bragging about his/her stimulus check in the office and what they're going to spend it on. Tomorrow, it will be your neighbor. The day after that, you could be browsing the dark web. It's a slippery slope.\n\nThe economic impact payment does not measure how much is in your bank account. There is no way the government can browse the property records of every single American. It is an advance payment of a tax credit on your 2020 return, and that is used as a guide on how people are faring. If you are earning $75,000 a year as an individual or $150,000 a year as a couple, you qualify. After that there is a sliding scale, which bottoms out at $99,000 for an individual or $198,000 as a couple.\n\nThe Moneyist:My boyfriend's ex-wife claimed her 2 sons as dependents on her taxes, and received their stimulus checks, but they live with us\n\nNearly one-third of people who received a stimulus check last summer used it to pay bills and, in a Twitter poll TWTR, +1.37% of 889,000 people, over 60% said a $600 payment would not be enough to get by on. It's half of what folks got last time. Another YouGov poll said bills were the No. 1 priority for stimulus-check spending. It's alarming to look at how many Americans used these funds to keep a roof over their head and pay for necessities, said the report by YouGov.\n\nGiven that you have a job and can put food on the table and a roof over your head, not qualifying for a check is something to be grateful for. We could all look at people buying televisions, video games, sporting goods and toys at Walmart WMT, -0.83% , Costco COST, +0.59% and Target TGT, -1.00% and get mad when they say, Thank God for my stimulus! But there are many more people in the supermarket using the money for food, or writing checks to their electricity company.\n\nWe don't know what is going on with people when we look at them across the office kitchen and think, How did they get the last cup of coffee in the jar? How is that fair? I could kill for a cup of coffee. I've been looking forward to it all morning. They just had a coffee an hour ago. Maybe your colleague has a spouse at home with a serious illness, who hasn't worked in 10 years, or is swimming in debt on those 10 houses. Maybe he has a serious illness.\n\nSometimes (actually, make that often times) the greatest wisdom comes from children. In that spirit, listen to what this little tells her father when he asks to help undo her seat belt. That's the kind of spirit we need in a deeply polarized America right now. Be careful about coveting other people's stimulus checks, homes or even their lives. It's easy to believe we deserve more than our neighbor or, hell, even our identical twin, and how everything is easier for them.\n\nThe truth, however, is that we never really know.\n\nThe Moneyist: I earned $100,000 in 2019, but far less in 2020. Why did I not get a stimulus check? How is that fair?\n\nYou can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\nWant to read more?Follow Quentin Fottrell on Twitterand read more of his columns here
As we enter the new year it's a good time to reflect on major life changes that may have occurred for you and your family during the past year.\n\nChanges like; a marriage, birth of a child, death of a family member, a change in health status, divorce, change of jobs, caring for a special needs child, entering retirement, charitable giving decisions, selling of a primary residence or investment property. Any one of these events could trigger the need to revise your estate plan by making adjustments to your will or creating an amendment to your trust or reassigning beneficiary(s); both primary and contingent.
U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak on Tuesday unveiled a fresh £4.6 billion ($6.2 billion) support package for struggling U.K. businesses, just hours after the government imposed a third lockdown in the country to curb a rapid rise in coronavirus cases.\n\nBusinesses in the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors will be able to claim up to £9,000 ($12,235) in one-off grants to help them cope with the latest restrictions, which were announced late on Monday night by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nUnder the new lockdown, all hospitality venues and nonessential shops must remain closed until at least mid February, heaping more pressure on those already-struggling sectors.\n\nThe new lockdown grants are expected to benefit more than 600,000 business properties across the U.K., and will be worth around £4 billion, the treasury said. A further £594 million will be made available to local authorities and devolved administrations to support businesses not eligible for the grants.\n\nRead: Third national lockdown confirmed as new variant spreads across England\n\nThe new strain of the virus presents us all with a huge challenge — and whilst the vaccine is being rolled out, we have needed to tighten restrictions further, Sunak said in a statement. This [support package] will help businesses to get through the months ahead — and crucially it will help sustain jobs, so workers can be ready to return when they are able to reopen, he added.\n\nThe new one-off grants come in addition to billions of existing business support, including grants worth up to £3,000 for closed businesses, and up to £2,100 a month for impacted businesses once they reopen.\n\nSunak said in November that government support measures to that date to help businesses cope with the COVID-19 pandemic would cost about £280 billion this financial year.\n\nNews of the cash injection lifted shares in pub groups Marston's MARS, -2.23% and Mitchells & Butlers MAB, -2.87% , which rose 2.39% and 2.43% respectively in London trading on Tuesday morning. Restaurant Group RTN, -1.50% , which operates 350 restaurants and pubs across the U.K. including the Frankie & Benny's and Wagamama chains, saw its stock rise 3.69%.\n\nRead: European markets slide as new lockdown measures set to take effect in the U.K. and Germany\n\nBusiness leaders welcomed the support package, but warned that on its own, the support wasn't enough to keep businesses afloat longer term.\n\n This is only a sticking plaster for immediate ills  — Kate Nicholls, CEO, UKHospitality\n\nWhile this announcement is most welcome, make no mistake that this is only a sticking plaster for immediate ills — it is not enough to even cover the costs of many businesses and certainly will not underpin longer-term business viability for our sector, said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UKHospitality.\n\nTo address the inevitable and existential challenges that hospitality faces, we need confirmation of extensions to the business rates holiday and of the 5% VAT [value-added tax] rate, she added.\n\nThe U.K.'s hospitality sector suffered lost sales of more than £53 billion ($72 billion) in 2020 due to the impact of coronavirus restrictions on trade, according to a data report by CGA and UKHospitality published in December.\n\nAdam Marshall, director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said on Twitter TWTR, +1.37% that ministers need to set out a clear support package for the whole of 2021 — not just until spring — to help businesses of all shapes and sizes survive this difficult and uncertain year.\n\nRoger Barker, director of policy and corporate governance at the Institute of Directors, said the new cash injection would go some way to reassuring the worst affected businesses, but warned that the chancellor must remain wary of a spring cliff-edge in business support as the furlough program and other support measures unwind.\n\nRead: Europe hopes next COVID stimulus will be the last
Ford Motor Co. F, +1.06% said Tuesday it expects a record 2015 pre-tax profit, around the upper range of the car maker's guidance of $10 billion to $11 billion. The results for 2016 are expected to be equal to or higher than 2015, the car maker said. The company also declared a supplemental dividend of 25 cents a share, which would be on top of first-quarter dividend of 15 cents a share. Ford said it plans another active product year with 12 global car product launches, including a new Ford Focus electric, with a projected 100-mile range. Shares of Ford fell 1.6% in late trading Tuesday after ending the regular trading day up 0.6%.
There's a lot written about converting a traditional IRA to fund a Roth IRA, and with good reason.\n\nThe benefits of owning a Roth IRA are nothing short of amazing. A Roth grows without any taxes and all amounts withdrawn are tax-free.\n\nThe problem is that it's difficult to get money into a Roth. That's because you have to pay taxes today on the amount you choose convert from a regular IRA.\n\nThe taxes are due in the year you convert at your regular income-tax rate. If you move a large sum all at once that can bump you into a higher tax bracket.\n\nConverting in smaller amounts for several years is a wise move, but even then your income will be higher every year. Because taxes are progressive, you end up paying your highest personal tax rate on those converted IRA dollars.\n\nRoth 'sweet spot'\n\nFor that reason, people often go online and use a Roth IRA calculator to try to figure out if converting is worthwhile for them.\n\nYet Roth calculators can be of little use. You have to know your tax rate in the future, which is difficult to estimate. Tax rates could rise or fall, and your future income might be more or less than you expected.\n\nWhat can you do to get the biggest bang for your buck? Plan today to hit the Roth sweet spot.\n\nThis is when an individual has stopped working, is not taking Social Security, and income has dropped to close to zero. Sometimes there is income from dividends in a taxable account or rental property, but broadly speaking they've hit a dramatic income trough.\n\nNaturally, their income-tax rate dives just as dramatically.\n\nThis is a wonderful opportunity to take advantage of converting to a Roth before one turns 70.\n\nWhy 70? Because after that age the government forces us to take money out of traditional IRAs and 401(k) plans and pay income taxes on those withdrawals.\n\nThis is known as a required minimum distribution (RMD) and it happens every year after age 70½, increasing each year.\n\nHow to avoid the biggest 401(k) mistakes\n\nTax-rate trough\n\nFor people in their early 60s but not yet 70 who are in an income trough, I suggest working with their CPA to suggest an appropriate amount to convert year by year.\n\nThis can result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in a Roth IRA by the time one turns 70.\n\nAn extra bonus is that, after 70, owners of Roth IRAs are not required to make yearly RMDs on those contributions, unlike with a traditional IRA.\n\nSo now they have money that is literally tax-free forever, will grow tax-free forever, and which is not subject to IRS distribution rules.\n\nAnyone who is in this situation in their 60s should carefully consider this strategy to fund a Roth IRA while they are in an income and tax-rate trough.\n\nHitting the Roth sweet spot can make a huge difference in your retirement lifestyle and your legacy — everything that matters financially in retirement.
